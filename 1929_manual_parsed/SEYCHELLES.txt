SEYCHELLES.

Description.

The Seychelles Islands are situated between the parallels of S. lat. 4° and 5°. The total area of the Colony and its dependencies is 166½ sq. miles. The number of islands under the Seychelles Government is 92.

The death-rate in 1927 was 15·87 per 1,000; the birth-rate being 28·28 per 1,000.

Mahé is the largest and most populous of the Seychelles Islands. It is 17 miles long and 4 to 7 miles broad, and is estimated to contain 55½ square miles. It has about 105 miles of good roads and paths, and communication between all the districts of the island is easy.

It is distant from Mauritius 934, from Madagascar 600, and from Zanzibar 970 miles. It is fertile, and healthy. The shade temperature seldom exceeds 84, and falls frequently at night to 72, and the records taken on the hills are several degrees lower. The rainfall at Victoria was in 1925, 134 inches.

The island rises abruptly from the sea, and the highest peak reaches the elevation of 2,997 feet. Victoria, the capital of the island, is situated in a valley in the north-east, and has a safe and commodious harbour, provided with a lighthouse showing a white flash of 1 second duration every 10 seconds.

The other chief islands are Praslin (9,700 acres); Silhouette (4,900 acres); La Digue (2,500 acres), Curieuse (900 acres); Félicité (800 acres); North Island (525 acres); St. Anne (500 acres);
Providence (500 acres); Frigate (500 acres); Denis (340 acres); Carf (290 acres); and Bird or Sea Cow Island (160 acres).

The following islands are also dependencies of Seychelles:—The Amirantes, Alphonse Island, Bijoutier Island, St. Francois Island, St. Pierre Island, the Cosmoledo Group, Astove Island, Assumption Island, Coëtivy, Aldabra and Farquhar Island.

The island of Coëtivy, formerly a dependency of Mauritius, was transferred to Seychelles by Letters Patent in 1907, and the Farquhar Island in 1922.

History.

The islands are believed to have been discovered by a Portuguese named Pedro Mascaregnas, in 1505, but the discovery was not apparently followed by any attempt at colonisation.

Previous to the French occupation they were the resort of pirates or corsairs who infested the Indian Ocean, some of whose names are borne by descendants in Mahé at the present time.

Under the Government at Mauritius of Labourdonnais, whose name they originally bore, their position was first defined in 1743, and M. Picault, who took possession of the Islands in the name of the King of France, called the principal island Mahé. In 1756 the group was re-named the Seychelles Islands, in honour of the Vicomte Moreau des Séchelles, who was Controller-General of Finance under Louis XV., from 1754 to 1756.

The natural resources of the Islands, and their freedom from hurricanes, induced the French to transplant from the Isle de France (now Mauritius) cinnamon, cloves, and nutmegs, under the directions of M. Poivre. Much secrecy was at first observed in regard to the existence of these retired plantations, the object being to wrest from the Dutch the lucrative spice monopoly which the colonies of that nation then enjoyed in Europe from their own possessions.

The rumours of the war that broke out between France and England in 1778, induced the then French Governor of Mauritius, Count de Souillac, to issue peremptory orders that in the event of an attack the spice plantations should be at once destroyed. Soon afterwards a French ship from Madagascar, having slaves on board, called at Mahé to take in wood and water, but fearing that the English might be in possession, adopted the ruse of hoisting the English flag. The small French force at Mahé had already been withdrawn, and the officer in charge, knowing that resistance was useless, at once set fire to the whole of the spice trees, each of which had previously been surrounded with dry wood and inflammable material.

During the war of the French Revolution Mahé was extremely useful to French ships as a place of refuge and refitment, but on the 17th May, 1794, it was captured by Captain Newcome, of His Majesty’s ship “Orpheus.”

The last French Governor, M. De Quincy, who was born at Paris in November, 1748, became, after Lieutenant Sullivan, R.M., who had been placed in charge, had left, the first Agent Civil under the British Government. M. De Quincy’s reign as French Governor lasted twenty years. He remained for eighteen years in the service of the British Government, and died on the 10th July, 1827.

The capitulation was renewed in 1806 by Capt. Ferrier, of His Majesty’s ship “Albion,” but it was not until the capture of Mauritius in 1810, that Seychelles was formally taken possession of by the appointment of an Agent, and incorporated as a dependency of that Colony. From 1794 to 1810 Seychelles, though nominally a British Colony, seems to have been administered as a French Colony, and all Civil Status Acts ran in the name of the French Government. A Board of Civil Commissioners was appointed in 1872, when the finances of the Seychelles were separated from those of Mauritius. The title of the Head of the Government was changed from that of Civil Commissioner to that of Chief Civil Commissioner. The powers of the Board were further enlarged in 1874 by another Order in Council.

The increasing importance of these islands was considered sufficient to warrant an alteration in the constitution of the Government, and in December, 1888, an Order in Council was passed creating the office of Administrator, and nominating an Executive and Legislative Council. In 1897, by Letters Patent and Royal Instructions, the Administrator was given full powers as Governor, and Seychelles was practically separated from Mauritius. The separation was completely carried out by Letters Patent of 31st August, 1903, by which Seychelles was erected into a separate Colony under its own Governor and Commander-in-Chief.

An education grant of Rs. 19,964 is given for assisting schools of all denominations, of which there were 22 in 1926. All schools are now denominational, and Government Scholarships and Awards are offered both to primary and secondary schools. Technical education is dealt with by means of Government apprenticeships. All schools are inspected by the Inspector of Schools.

Communications, &c.

The British India Company’s steamers call regularly once every 4 weeks from Bombay to East African Ports, and once every 8 weeks on their return voyage from Mombasa to Bombay. The Norwegian East Africa Line and the Havraise steamers call irregularly at this port on their way to Europe. The Admiralty used Victoria as a coaling station. Seychelles is now included in the East Indies Naval Station.

Telegraphic communication with Mauritius and Europe via Zanzibar was completed in November, 1893. Direct cables to Aden and Colombo were completed in 1922. The rates for telegrams from Seychelles are 75 cts. per word to Mauritius or Zanzibar, and Rs. 1.50 to Aden or Europe.

The present letter rate of postage to the United Kingdom, India, Dominions and British Possessions is 12 cents; to other countries of the Postal Union 20 cents. The parcels post has been in full operation since April, 1890. The cash on delivery service for parcel post was introduced in 1911. The money order system is in operation with England and numerous other countries and colonies, including Bombay, Aden, Zanzibar, Mauritius and Ceylon.

Savings Bank and Currency.

A Government Savings bank was established in March, 1897, and at the close of the year 1927, the amount standing to the credit of depositors was Rs. 192,836. All the Savings Bank funds are invested. There is a Branch Savings Bank at Praslin. The branches which were established at Anse Royale and La Digue were closed during 1906, as there were no transactions.

The currency consists of the Indian rupee and the Mauritius subsidiary coinage. Accounts are kept in rupees and cents. Indian, Mauritius, and Seychelles Government Notes also circulate freely.
Local Boards.

A Local Board of Health, vested with powers and duties somewhat similar to those entrusted to Municipal Bodies, was created in Victoria at the end of 1900. In 1922 the title was changed to that of "The Victoria Town Board." Similar Boards were created for the Islands of Praslin and La Digue at the end of 1901, and for the South Mahé District in March, 1902.

Revenue, Trade, Products, &c.

The revenue is derived principally from specific import duties, which are light, and an ad valorem duty of 15 per cent. on articles not otherwise enumerated (10 per cent. surtax on Customs Imports duty has been imposed for the period of the War and is still in force), licences, a capitation tax and a tax on immovable property and stamps. An export duty of Rs. 1 a ton is levied on guano, prepared fertiliser, and mangrove bark, and Rs. 1 per hectolitre of whale oil. There is also a fixed export duty of Rs. 2.50 per kilo. on tortoise-shell (carat).

In 1927 the chief exports were copra, 4,612 tons; guano, 11,329 tons; vanilla, 3,245 kilos; tortoise-shell, 1,014 kilos; essential oils, 60,060 litres; rubber, 8,783 kilos; tripangas, 7,176 kilos.

In Victoria, there is a Botanic Garden containing many interesting tropical plants.

More especially at Praslin, though also in other parts of the group, are to be found the celebrated coco-de-mer, with the leaves of which beautiful hats and delicate basket work are made by the natives.

The Aldabra group of islands under the Seychelle administration is the habitat of the gigantic land tortoises; numerous living specimens are, however, to be seen in Mahé and the neighbouring islands, and there are some, large and small, in the tortoise pens at Government House.

There are lighthouses on Denis Island and Mamelles Island (9 miles north-east of Mahé in long. 55° 32' 20" E., and lat. 4° 29' S.), and in Victoria Harbour. The light installed on Capucin Point was discontinued on the 31st July, 1922. The quarantine station is placed on Long Island opposite to Victoria.

SIERRA LEONE.

Situation and Area.

The territory known as the Colony and Protectorate of Sierra Leone is an area of some 27,250 square miles, roughly circular in shape, lying between 6° 55" and 10° of N. lat., and 10° 20" and 13° 25" of W. long. The sea coast, 210 miles in length, extends from Kiragba at about lat. 9° N., on the border of French Guinea, to the Mano River at lat. 6° 55" N. on the border of the Republic of Liberia.

The Colony portion of this area, i.e. the territories acquired by the Crown by Treaty of Cession or otherwise consists of the following:—the Sierra Leone Peninsula in which is situated Freetown (the seat of Government), Sherbo Island, the islands of Tasso, Bananas, Turtles, York, Buna, Shaye and other small islets, the Lower Lokko and Matoki Chiefdoms in the Northern Province, and the Bumpe, Kagboro, Bagru, Mano Bagru, Timeld, Bendu, Cha, Mongoba Bullon, Messi Krim, and part of the Manosa Krim Chiefdoms in the Southern Province. The Crown has also acquired a strip of land, varying in depth from a quarter of a mile to one mile throughout the whole coast line not included in the areas specified above. Of these areas the Peninsula of Sierra Leone, Tasso Island, Banana Islands, York Island, and the township of Bonthe in Sherbro Island, only, are administered as strictly Colony; the other areas are administered as part of the Protectorate.

History.

The Colony of Sierra Leone originated in the sale and cession of a portion of land by "King" Nembanu and his subordinate chiefs to Captain John Taylor, of His Britannic Majesty's brig "Miro," on behalf of the "free community of settlers, their heirs, and successors, lately arrived from England, and under the protection of the British Government." This portion of land was described in the treaty as extending from the bay commonly called Frenchman's Bay, but of which the name was changed to St. George's Bay, coastwise up the River Sierra Leone to Gambia Island, and southerly or inland from the riverside 20 miles. The treaty is dated 22nd August, 1788.

The main purpose of the Colony in its inception was to secure a home on the African Continent for a number of natives of Africa, and some others, who from various circumstances had been separated from the countries of their origin, and were destitute in and about London. Subsequently the Colony was used as a settlement for Africans rescued from slave-ships during the period when England was putting forth her efforts for the suppression of the over-sea traffic in slaves. The territory of the Colony received additions from time to time by various concessions from the native chiefs. Thus, on the 10th July, 1807, "King" Farima and "King" Tom ceded all the land they possessed in the peninsula of Sierra Leone lying to the westward of the Colony; and in 1861 Bai Conteh, "King" of Kwaia, with his chiefs, ceded a portion of the Kwaia country abutting on the Colony of Sierra Leone, measuring 10 miles in width and 16 miles in length from the River Sierra Leone to the River Ribbi, and particularly described as to its inland boundary in the Treaty of Cession. In 1825 the Governor of Sierra Leone made a treaty of cession with various Chiefs in, and in the neighbourhood of, Sherbro Island, for the purpose of adding these countries to the territories of the Colony. This
treaty, not immediately ratified by the Crown, was revived by a new agreement made in 1882. Other Treaties of Cession were made from time to time.

On August 21st, 1896, a Proclamation was issued declaring a Protectorate over the Hinterland of Sierra Leone, and Ordinances were passed providing for the administration of this Protectorate, which, by Order-in-Council No. 11 of 1920, and subsequent amending orders, is divided into three Provinces as follows:

Northern Province Districts.—Port Loko, Karene, Bomhali, Kambia, Koinadugu and Ronietta.

Central Province Districts.—Moyamba, Kono, Kenema, Panguma and Pendembu.

Southern Province Districts.—Shebar, Sembehun and Gbangbama, Sumbuya, Pujehun and Mano River.

By Order-in-Council No. 8 of 1925, dated 5th October, 1925, parts of the Port Loko and Bomhali Districts of the Northern Province were constituted a new District, called the Ronietta District.

General Description.

The peninsula of Sierra Leone is about 25 miles in length, and from 10 to 12 miles in breadth at its widest part. It is one of the few points on the African coast where there is high land near the sea. It is formed by a range of volcanic mountains, running parallel to the seas from N.N.W. to S.S.E., the summits of which, in the Picket Hill, Sugar Loaf and Leicester Mountains, rise in conical form to a height of from 2,000 to 3,000 feet. The mountains are composed principally of novite, and are thickly wooded. They are intersected by ravines and small valleys, and there are considerable tracts of level ground, especially on the eastern side of the peninsula, where it sinks to the mainland.

The configuration of the Protectorate varies much in different localities. The parts on the banks of the rivers are low and swampy, while away from the rivers the country consists of low rolling downs, with here and there, in the northern portion, a range of hills some 3,000 feet in height. Unlike many regions on the West Coast of Africa, the country is well watered by rivers and streams. The principal rivers which empty themselves into the Atlantic on the Sierra Leone Coast are the Great and Little Skarocies, the Sierra Leone or Rokell, the Sherbro, the Jong, the Manneh or Mano, the Ribbi, Bum, Kittam, and Moa, most of which are navigable for several miles.

The capital, Freetown, lies about four miles up the Sierra Leone River, at the foot of a chain of hills rising 2,900 feet above the sea. In 1921 it contained 44,142 inhabitants. It possesses the best harbour in West Africa, and is an important coaling station and a port of registry.

The peninsula of Sierra Leone and the lands immediately adjoining have a population (including Freetown and its Districts) of 85,163. It yields only a small quantity of exportable commodities, but ginger and coffee thrive if well looked after. The extent of the territory is, however, small (256 square miles), and the generally rocky soil is not very well adapted for cultivation.

Considerable quantities of palm kernels, palm oil, piasava, with other articles of lesser importance are exported via Bonthe in the Southern Province.

Many districts in the Protectorate are fertile and well adapted to the growth of oil palms, cocoanuts, bene seed, kola nuts, gum-producing trees, ginger, cocoa, rice, and other tropical products. No minerals have been discovered, except iron, which can hardly be reckoned as of exportable value.

The population of the Protectorate was in 1921 estimated at 1,456,148 and is composed of the following tribes:

Northern Province { Temnes, Limbas, Susu,
Lokkos, Fulahs, Mandingoes, Korankos, Yalunkas.
Central Province { Mendes, Sherbros, Konnobs,
a few Kissais.
Southern Province { Mendes, Krimis, Sherbros,
Gallinas, Golas and Vais.

Constitution.

A Charter, issued on May 27th, 1863, created an Executive Council for the Colony composed of four members nominated by the Crown. The Legislative Council was to consist of the members of the Executive Council and nominated members.

A Charter, dated the 19th of February, 1866, established a Central Government of the settlements on the West Coast of Africa, with the seat of government at Sierra Leone.

A new Charter, dated the 24th of July, 1874, revoked so much of the Charter of the 19th of February, 1866, as provided for the government of the Gold Coast and Lagos under the Governor-in-Chief of the West Africa Settlements, and those settlements were erected into a distinct government. A further Charter, dated 17th of December, 1874, erected a new government of the "West Africa Settlements," consisting of Sierra Leone and the Gambia, and created a Legislative Council in each settlement, consisting of the officer administering the government, and not less than two other persons, to be designated by royal instructions or warrant. New letters patent dated 17th June, 1885, provided for the continuance of the government on the same lines, with some minor differences. By letters patent of 28th Nov., 1888, the Gambia was again made a separate government. By letters patent, dated 3rd April, 1913, and Royal Instructions, dated 4th May, 1922, there were constituted an Executive Council composed of the Officer in command of the troops, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Colonial Treasurer and the Director of Medical and Sanitary Services, and a Legislative Council, composed of the members of the Executive Council and four unofficial members nominated by the Crown.

On March 7, 1913, an Imperial Order-in-Council was issued providing for the administration of the Protectorate of Sierra Leone. The Order applies to the territories, not being portions of the Colony of Sierra Leone, lying between the sixth and tenth degrees of north latitude and the tenth and fourteenth degrees of west longitude, and beginning at the extreme southerly point of the Colony on the Anglo-Liberian boundary, as delimited under the provisions of the Anglo-Liberian Conventions, November 11, 1885, and January 21, 1911.

The Governor and Commander-in-Chief for the time being of the Colony of Sierra Leone is also the Governor of the Protectorate. Authority is given to the Governor by Ordinances passed in the Legislative Council to exercise and provide for giving effect to the powers and jurisdiction acquired by the Crown in Sierra Leone.

Letters Patent, dated the 28th January, 1924, revoked those issued on the 3rd April, 1913, and made fresh provision for the appointment of the Governor and Commander-in-Chief, and instruc-
