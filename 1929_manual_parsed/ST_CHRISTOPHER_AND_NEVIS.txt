ST. CHRISTOPHER AND NEVIS.

This Presidency consists of the Islands of St. Christopher (St. Kitts), Nevis and Anguilla, with their several dependencies. These were united to form one Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1882.

The total population on 31st December, 1927, was estimated at 35,863, as compared with 38,214, the population at the census of 1921. The total area is about 150 square miles.

Constitution and Government.

In 1625 Mr. (afterwards Sir Thomas) Warner landed in St. Christopher, bearing a Royal Commission to the Earl of Carlisle, by which the islands of St. Christopher (or Merwar's Hope), Nevis, Barbados and Montserrat were taken under royal protection, and given over to his custody as the King's Lieutenant.

In 1671 St. Christopher, Nevis, Montserrat, Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla "and all other the Leeward Islands" were separated from Barbados and created the "Leeward Caribbee Islands Government," and Sir Charles Wheler was appointed "Captain-General" of the same. The chief seat of government was then at Nevis, but afterwards transferred to Antigua, and the government of each island, in the absence of the Captain-General, was administered by a Lieutenant-Governor, or, when none such was appointed, by the President of the Council.

In 1689 Colonel Christopher Codrington was appointed Governor-in-Chief, and his Commission, granted by William III., and dated 20th October, 1689, authorised him to call assemblies of free-
holders and planters within any of the islands "jointly and severally to make laws for the public peace, welfare and good government of the said islands," thus providing for separate and federal legislatures. The Legislature in St. Christopher and in Nevis, as in the other islands of the government, consisted of two houses, a nominated Council and an elected Assembly, and had secured to it its own peculiar laws and local jurisdiction.

By Letters Patent, dated 26th April, 1816, the Commission originally granted to Sir William Stapleton was revoked, and the Leeward Caribbee Islands formed into two distinct governments, the first comprising Antigua, Montserrat and Barbuda, and the other St. Christopher, Nevis, Anguilla and the Virgin Islands.

By Letters Patent, dated 23rd November, 1832, the General Government was restored, Dominica being for the first time included, and a Governor and Commander-in-Chief, with two Lieutenant-Governors for St. Christopher, Nevis and Anguilla, and for Dominica respectively, were appointed, each island possessing a Legislative Council and House of Assembly, which continued, under the supervision of the Governor-in-Chief, to legislate for local interests.

In 1866 measures were introduced in each island to alter the constitution, and the two houses then existing were replaced by a single Legislative Assembly, consisting of ex-officio members, nominees of the Crown, and representatives of the people elected under a limited franchise.

In 1873 the single chamber constitution was repealed in St. Kitts and in Nevis, and the Crown Colony form of government adopted in its stead, and in 1882 these two islands, with Anguilla, were united into one Presidency.

The office of Lieutenant-Governor, which existed until 1870, has been abolished, and the Presidency, in the absence thereof from the Governor, is under the immediate supervision of an Administrator, acting under his instructions.

There is one Executive Council for the Presidency, consisting of the Governor, the Administrator, certain ex-officio members, and such other persons as His Majesty may from time to time appoint. The Legislative Council consists of seven official and seven nominated unofficial members, besides the Governor and the Administrator. Of the unofficial members not more than six shall be from among the people of St. Kitts and Anguilla, and one at least from among the people of Nevis. The Governor, or, in his absence, the Administrator, or, in the absence of both of them, a member of the Council appointed in writing, presides, and the President of the Council enjoys an original and a casting vote. The Council meets at the town of Basseterre in St. Kitts.

Industry.

Tobacco was at first the principal crop grown, but it soon lost its pre-eminence, and the main industry of the two larger islands is now the production of sugar, and the growth of Sea Island cotton. Rum is manufactured in small quantities. About 6,700 acres are in sugar-cane cultivation, and 4,000 in cotton. The crop produced in the Presidency during 1927-28 amounted to 15,657 tons of sugar, 33,466 gallons of syrup and molasses, and 416,850 lbs. of Sea Island cotton. Arrowroot, coffee, peanuts and vegetables are also grown in small quantities for local consumption. Coconuts are extensively grown in Nevis. Cattle, horses and small mules are raised.

St. Kitts.

The island lies in latitude 17° 18' N., and longitude 62° 48' W. The area of the main body of it presents a long oval, from the south-eastern end of which runs a narrow neck, gradually expanding into a small knob of land, within which are the salt ponds.

The total length of the island is about 23 miles. The total area is 68 square miles.

The central part of the main body consists of a range of lofty rugged mountains, which traverses it from south-east to north-west, attaining its greatest height at Mount Misery, which is about 3,711 feet above the sea. This range of hills describes nearly a semicircle, forming the spacious and fertile valley or plain, on the seaboard of which lies Basseterre, the principal town, with a population of about 7,736. On the south-west side of the island, between the mountains and the sea, but nearer the latter, is Brimstone Hill, formerly the seat of the garrison. It is quite isolated, and about 750 feet in height.

The circle of land formed by the skirts and lower slopes of the mountain-range of the main body of the island, and the valley of Basseterre, constitute nearly the whole of the arable and cultivated portion of the island. The higher slopes of the mountains are covered with short grass, affording excellent pasturage, while their summits are crowned with dense wood.

The climate, for a tropical one, is decidedly healthy. The highest temperature in the shade is about 88°, the lowest 66°, and the mean average about 76°.

The average rainfall in St. Kitts for the year 1927 was 64.36 inches, i.e., 9.82 inches above the average for the past 13 years.

St. Christopher or St. Kitts, the Carib name of which was Liamuiga or Llaimuga, "The Fertile Isle," was the first settled of the British West Indies. Mr. Thomas Warner was despatched thither in 1623 by Mr. Ralph Merrifield, and commenced tobacco cultivation. His first crop, however, was destroyed by a hurricane, and the Colony was for some time in a precarious condition until the arrival of the ship Hopewell with supplies for the settlement.

In 1625, Warner, at the instance of the Earl of Carlisle, to whom Charles I. had granted Letters Patent over the islands of St. Christopher, Nevis, Antigua, Montserrat and Barbados, was appointed Governor-General of these Islands and Governor of St. Kitts.

Upon the same day in the year that Warner returned from a recruiting visit to England M. D'Esnambuc, with a few Frenchmen, reached the island, and was permitted to form a settlement beside the English, a treaty of partition being afterwards made, the French obtaining the two ends of the island and the English the middle portion. From thence the greater number of the Lesser Antilles were colonised, thus earning for St. Kitts the name "Mother of the Antilles."

In October, 1628, a Spanish squadron devastated the island and ordered its abandonment, an order that had quite a contrary effect, and the two settlements rapidly increased. Warner was knighted in 1629.

War between the mother countries led to war between "the two nations" at St. Kitts, with the result that in April, 1666, the English were expelled
from the island. Repelling an attempt at its recapture, the French remained in possession until 1671, when, after prolonged negotiations, they evacuated the English portion. Again, in 1689, the English suffered expulsion under cruel and barbarous circumstances, but a year later Sir Timothy Thornhill, after three weeks' fighting, recovered the island for the British arms, the whole of it remaining in England's possession for seven years, when, by the treaty of Ryswick in 1697, the French were restored to their former portions of it.

Once again did England become sole mistress when, in 1702, the French capitulated without resistance to General Hamilton, supported by a fleet of twenty ships. A French invasion four years later proved futile, and in 1712 the whole island was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Utrecht.

For seventy years there was peace, and then, in 1782, after a memorable siege and two naval encounters, France enjoyed possession of the Fertile Isles. It was restored to England by the Treaty of Versailles on 28th January, 1783, and two French raids in 1805 and 1806 mark the close of the remarkable history of this island's warfares.

Nevis.

The island of Nevis is situated in 17° 40' N. lat., and 62° 33' W. long. It was discovered in 1498 by Columbus, and was colonised by the English from St. Kitts in 1628. Charlestown, the principal town, has a population of about 1,150. The population of Nevis largely consists of peasant proprietors.

The island, which is divided into five parishes, is nearly of a circular form; its area is about 50 square miles, or about 32,000 acres, of which about 16,000 acres are fit for cultivation; its greatest elevation 3,596 feet above the sea.

The climate is very similar to that of St. Kitts, from which place it is separated by a strait of about two miles in breadth at its narrowest part, which, however, lies out of the direct course for boats plying between the two islands. The distance between Basseterre (St. Kitts) and Charlestown (Nevis) is about twelve miles. The roughness of the sea occasionally prevents communication, but, as a rule, the boats which ply between the two ports have the wind abeam.

Anguilla.

Anguilla is situated in 18° 12' N. lat., and 63° 5' W. long., about 60 miles N.W. of St. Kitts, and is sixteen miles in length, and varies in breadth from three to one and a half miles, containing an area of thirty-five square miles. The "Dogs" and neighbouring islands are dependencies of Anguilla.

The local courts for the administration of justice are the Magistrate's Court and the Civil Jurisdiction Court. The island is also within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the Leeward Islands, and is visited periodically by a Judge of the Summary Jurisdiction Court.

The island is healthy, but suffers from want of an adequate water supply.

Besides cattle, ponies and small stock, the chief product is salt. Sea Island cotton is cultivated.
