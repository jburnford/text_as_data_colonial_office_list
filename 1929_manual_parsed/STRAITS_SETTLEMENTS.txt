STRAITS SETTLEMENTS.

The Straits Settlements, comprising Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, were transferred from the control of the Indian Government to that of the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the 1st April, 1867, by an Order in Council, issued under the authority of an Act of the Imperial Parliament (29 & 30 Vict. c. 115).

Situation and Area.

Singapore is an island of which the greatest length is about 27 miles by 14 wide, containing an area of 217 square miles, situated at the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, from which it is separated by a narrow strait about three-quarters of a mile in width. There are a number of small islands adjacent to it which form part of the settlement, which now comprises also Christmas Island, and the Cocos Islands.

The seat of Government is the town of Singapore, at the southern point of the island, in lat. 1° 17' north, and long. 103° 50' east.

Penang is an island about 15 miles long and 9 broad, containing an area of 108 square miles, situated off the west coast of the Malay Peninsula in 5° N. latitude, and at the northern extremity or entrance to the Straits of Malacca. On the opposite shore of the mainland, from which the island is separated by a strait from 2 to 10 miles broad, is Province Wellesley, a strip of territory forming part of the settlement, averaging 8 miles in width, and extending 45 miles along the coast, including 10 miles of territory to the south of the Krian (vide infra), the whole containing an area of 280 square miles.

The chief town is George Town, in 5° 24' north lat. and 100° 21' east long.

Malacca is situated on the western coast of the peninsula between Singapore and Penang, about 110 miles from the former and 240 from the latter, and consists of a strip of territory about 42 miles in length, and from 8 to 25 miles in breadth, containing an area of 720 square miles. The town, called Malacca, is in 2° 10' north lat. and 102° 14' east long.

The Dindings, area about 183 square miles, include the island of Pangkor and a strip of territory opposite on the mainland, about 80 miles from Penang, in 4° 15' north lat. and 100° 35' east long. Lumut, the headquarters on the mainland, possesses a fine harbour with deep anchorage, and arrangements have been made for coasting steamers to call regularly.

The Cocos or Keeling Islands, which were declared a British possession in 1857, were placed by Letters Patent of 13th October, 1878, under the control of the Governor of Ceylon, and by Letters Patent dated the 1st of February, 1886, under the Governor of the Straits Settlements. In 1903 they were annexed to the Straits Settlements and incorporated with the Settlement of Singapore. The islands lie between lat. 11° 50' to 12° 48' S., long. 96° 50' E., 700 miles S.W. of Batavia. The largest is 5 miles by ¼ mile. There are large coconut plantations, and copra, oil, and nuts are exported. In 1902 a station on the Cape-Australia cable route was established on Direction Island, in the north-eastern part of the group. The population numbers about 795.

Christmas Island, situated in the Indian Ocean, 190 miles S. of Java, lat. 10° 30' S., long. 105° 40' E., was annexed in June, 1888, and placed under the administration of the Governor of the Straits Settlements by Letters Patent of 5th Jan., 1889. In 1900 it was annexed to the Straits Settlements, and incorporated with the Settlement of Singapore. The island, which is densely wooded, has an area of about 62 square miles. In shape it is a rough parallelogram with deeply indented sides, its greatest length being about 12 miles, and its greatest breadth about 9 miles. The inhabitants, who number about 1,100, are all, with the exception of the District Officer and his staff, employés of the Christmas Island Phosphate Company, which was formed in 1897 to work the extensive deposits of phosphate of lime, to which the island owes its importance.

The total area of the Colony with these dependencies is about 1,600 square miles.

By Letters Patent issued at the end of 1906, provision was made for the incorporation of the Colony of Labuan in that of the Straits Settlements. The provision came into effect from the 1st of January, 1907. An account of Labuan will be found below.

The Colony became associated with the administration of Brunei from about the same time (see below). A Commission as High Commissioner for Brunei was issued in 1906 to the
Governor of the Straits Settlements, and a subsequent Commission of the same year vested the post in the officer for the time being administering the government of the Straits Settlements.

History.

Malacca, said to have been founded by fugitives from the sack of Singapore, and known as an important independent State from early in the fifteenth century, is one of the oldest European settlements in the East, having been captured by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511, and held by them till 1641, when the Dutch, after frequent attempts, succeeded in driving them out. The settlement remained in the possession of the Dutch till 1795, when it was taken by the English, who held it till 1818. It was then restored to Holland, but was again transferred to British rule as a consequence of the Treaty of London (17th March, 1824), being exchanged for the British settlements in Sumatra.

When Malacca was captured by the Portuguese in 1511, it was one of the grand entrepôts for the commerce of the East, but as the Portuguese pushed their operations further to the east, in the archipelago and neighbouring countries, the trade of Malacca gradually declined and it ceased to be of consequence as a collecting centre, except for the trade of the Malay Peninsula and the island of Sumatra. This trade it retained under Dutch rule till the establishment of Penang in 1786. In a few years from that date its trade almost ceased, and it became, what it has ever since been, a place of little commercial importance, but possessing great agricultural resources. The trade of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra passed to Penang, which also carried on a large traffic with China, Siam, Borneo, the Celebes, and other places in the archipelago not under Dutch control; but no sooner was Singapore established than Penang in its turn had to yield the first place to Singapore, and came to depend chiefly on the local trade. At first unimportant, that trade has now assumed enormous proportions, owing to the development of the rich tin-mining areas and rubber-bearing lands of the Malay Peninsula.

Penang, or Prince of Wales' Island, was the first British settlement in the Malay Peninsula, having been ceded to the East India Company by the Raja of Kedah in 1786, with the proviso that the sum of £6,000 should be paid annually to the Raja of Kedah so long as the British occupied the island. In 1800, in consequence of the prevalence of piracy, a strip of the coast of the mainland, now called Province Wellesley, was acquired from the Raja, the annual payment being in return increased to £10,000. This has been subsequently enlarged from time to time, until it now extends from the Muda River to 10 miles south of the Krian River, a distance of 45 miles, containing in all 280 square miles. This province is in a high state of cultivation, the chief articles cultivated being sugar, paddy, coconuts, and rubber. In 1805 Penang was made a separate Presidency, of equal rank with Madras and Bombay. In 1826 Singapore and Malacca were incorporated with it under one government, Penang still remaining the seat of government. In 1836 the seat of government was transferred to Singapore.

The island of Pangkor and the Sembilan Islands were ceded by Perak in 1826, with a view to the suppression of piracy, but no use was made of the cession at the time. In 1874 the cession of these islands was confirmed by the Treaty of Pangkor (to which reference is made in dealing with the relations of the Colony with the Malay States), by which a strip of territory in the mainland opposite also became British. The whole now forms, under the name of the Dindings Territory, an outlying portion of the Settlement of Penang.

The original city of Singapore is said to have been founded by immigrants from Sumatra. It rose into prominence in the fourteenth century. Its greatness came to a sudden end in 1377, when it was sacked and destroyed by the Javanese, and thenceforth the island was scarcely inhabited until Sir Stamford Raffles took possession of it in 1819, by virtue of a treaty with the Johore princes. The new settlement was at first subordinate to Bengoolen (Fort Marlborough) in Sumatra, but in 1823 it was placed under the Government of Bengal; in 1826 it was, as above stated, united with Penang and Malacca, under the Governor and Council of the Incorporated Settlements.

Constitution, Law, and Justice.

The Government consists of a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council. The latter body consists of 13 official members and 13 unofficial members, of whom 2 are nominated by the Chambers of Commerce of Singapore and Penang.

The law in force is contained in local ordinances, and in such English and Indian Acts and Orders in Council as have been made applicable to the colony. The Indian Penal Code, with slight alterations, has been adopted, and there is a Civil Procedure Code based on the English Judicature Acts, as well as a Criminal Procedure Code based on the Indian one.

There is a Supreme Court, which holds assizes at Singapore and Penang every two months, and quarterly at Malacca; and which holds civil sittings, monthly at Singapore and Penang, and once a quarter at Malacca.

Climate.

The climate varies but little during the year. The mean temperature in Singapore for 1927 was 79°6 F.; in Penang 82°2 F.; in Province Wellesley, 80°1 F.; and in Malacca, 79° F. In Singapore there is a rainy season during the months of November, December and January. Otherwise the rainfall is pretty evenly distributed throughout the year. From carefully kept records of observations for a period of 10 years, from 1912 to 1921, it is found in Singapore that there is an annual average of 169 wet days; the average monthly rainfall for the same period was 259-32 millimetres. In 1927 the total rainfall in Singapore was 2,576-43 m.m.; in Penang 2,276 millimetres; in Province Wellesley 2,411 millimetres; in Malacca 2,623-8 millimetres. The wettest year recorded in Singapore was 1913 with 3,442-37 millimetres (158-37 inches). The force of the monsoons is not much felt, though the prevailing winds are generally in the direction of the monsoons blowing at the time, viz.:—S.W. from May to October, N.E. from November to April. At the change of these monsoons, short explosive storms (known as "Sumatras") are not infrequent, and are accompanied by some electrical disturbance.
Population.

At the census taken in 1901, 1911, and 1921, the total population of the Straits Settlements was found to be as follows:

| Year   | Singapore* | Penang† | Malacca |
|--------|------------|---------|---------|
| 1901   | 228,556    | 258,207 | 95,487  |
| 1911   | 311,985    | 278,003 | 124,081 |
| 1921   | 425,912    | 304,335 | 163,522 |

Total: 572,249 714,069 883,769

Trade.

The ports are, except in the case of petroleum, opium, liquors and tobacco, free from duties on imports or exports, nor are tonnage dues levied for general purposes.

The chief exports comprise tin, sugar, pepper, nutmeg, mace, sago, tapioca, rice, buffalo hides and horns, rattans, gutta, para rubber, gambier, gum, coffee, preserved pineapples, dyestuffs, tobacco, etc. Of these the only articles produced to any considerable extent in the colony are tapioca, rice, and rubber (chiefly in Malacca and Prov.

A list of the members and principal officers of the Boards is appended below.

Means of Communication.

Over 50 lines of seagoing steamers touch at Singapore. There is regular communication with Europe fortnightly by British India steamers, via Rangoon, Calcutta and Bombay, and fortnightly services by the Peninsular and Oriental and Messageries Maritimes vessels, via Ceylon; in addition there are fortnightly services by the Steamship Co. “Nederland” and the Rotterdam Lloyd; and at frequent intervals by the Holt’s, Chargeurs-Réunis, Glen and Shire, Japanese and other lines; with China and Japan once a fortnight by the P. and O. and M.M. lines, and by other lines frequently; with Cochin China fortnightly by the Messageries Maritimes and by other lines frequently; with Manila via Hong Kong by Holt’s Ellerman Line, and Spanish packets direct; with Bangkok by Straits steamship and other steamers and by train; with Batavia and other Netherlands India ports by various steamers; with Australian ports frequently by British India, Burns Philp, Ocean Steamship Co., Western Australia Steam Navigation Co., Austral—East Indies Line, K.P.M., and other lines direct, and occasionally via Colombo, with the sailings thence of Orient Packets, P. and O.

The operations of the Money Order Branch amounted in 1927 to $8,051,226, the principal business done being with India, Federated Malay States, United Kingdom, Netherlands East Indies, Ceylon, and United States of America.

Eleven submarine cables radiate from Singapore: 5 to Penang, thence to Madras (3), Colombo (2), Delhi (1); 2 to Batavia, of which one thence to Cocos; 1 to Banjoewangie, thence to Darwin (2); 1 direct to Hong Kong; 1 to Cochin-China, thence to Hong Kong (1), and 1 to Labuan, thence to Hong Kong (1). There are also Government telegraph lines from Penang to Province Wellesley, and thence to Perak, Selangor, Pahang, Trengganu, Negri Sembilan, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, Siam, Johore, Malacca, and Singapore. The land line from Singapore to Penang via Kuala Lumpur (303 miles) was opened for traffic in June, 1909. There are 702 miles of telegraph line, 163 nautical miles of submarine cable between Penang and Province Wellesley and 1½ miles between Singapore and Johore and there are 24,480 miles of telephone line. The telephone exchange in Singapore, is worked by the Oriental Telephone Co. and the exchanges in Penang, Province Wellesley and Malacca, are worked by the Post Office; there are 9,230 connections, including extensions to the three systems. A section of the Federated Malay States Railway system connects Singapore and Bangkok, Province Wellesley from South to North with a section from Bukit Mertajam to Prai. Another section of the system runs from the docks of Singapore to Kranji, and a third section connects Malacca with the main line at Tampin, in Negri Sembilan.

Education.

The control of all the Government schools is vested in the Director of Education, Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States.

By an Ordinance passed in 1909, an Education Board has been established, consisting of official and unofficial members, under the chairmanship of the Director of Education. Provision has been made by the same Ordinance for the levying of an Education Rate, the expenditure of which is under the control of the Board.

Vernacular instruction is provided for Malays free of charge. Attendance at these schools is compulsory for Malay children. The Government assists Chinese vernacular education by grants-in-aid to such schools as apply for them and are satisfactorily conducted. Instruction in English for all nationalities is provided in Government or grant-in-aid schools, and fees are charged. All the schools established by Government are secular. Raffles College has been instituted for a higher education in English in Singapore. There is a reformatory in Singapore for juvenile offenders and vagrants, in which technical instruction is provided.

The number of schools and scholars in 1927 was as follows:

| No. of schools | Enrolment | Attendance |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| Government English schools (boys and girls) | 20 | 8,146 | 7,681 |
| Grant-in-aid English schools (boys and girls) | 29 | 15,010 | 14,064 |
| Government vernacular schools (boys and girls) | 214 | 18,044 | 16,690 |
| Grant-in-aid vernacular schools (boys and girls) | 19 | 2,017 | 1,814 |
| Total | 282 | 43,217 | 40,249 |

Currency and Banking.

The standard coin of the Colony, by an Order of the Queen in Council, dated 2nd February, 1895, was the silver Mexican dollar, the British dollar and the old Hong Kong dollar being also legal tender.

A Committee to consider the currency question was appointed at home in 1902, and reported in favour of a change to the gold standard, if the local Government so desired. In accordance with the Committee's recommendations, a new Straits Settlements dollar was coined in India and introduced into the Colony and the adjoining Malay States. This coin was of the same weight and fineness as the British dollar. Under Order of the King in Council of 25th June, 1903, the Government declared this dollar to be the standard coin on 5th October, 1903. The Mexican and British dollars were demonetised from 1st September, 1904.

Under Order of the Governor in Council dated 29th January, 1906, the Currency Commissioners were empowered to issue notes in exchange for gold at the rate of $60 for £7 sterling, thus fixing the sterling value of the dollar at 2s. 4d. In November, 1906, gold sovereigns were declared legal tender at this rate under an Order of the King in Council of the 22nd October, 1906. In view of the great rise in the value of silver, an Order of the King in Council was passed on 11th February, 1907, under which the weight of the Straits Settlements dollar and fifty cent piece was reduced in order to preserve the fixed ratio to gold and by an order of the King in Council dated the 17th day of May, 1920, the fineness of the Straits Settlements dollar and fifty cent piece has been reduced.

Local silver and nickel coins representing fractional parts of the dollar are legal tender up to $2 and copper coins are legal tender up to $1. The half-dollar is unlimited legal tender. Under an Ordinance passed in 1917 currency notes of
denominations 25 cents and ten cents have been issued to the public owing to shortage of subsidiary silver. These notes are only legal tender to the extent of $2.

By the Currency Ordinance passed in 1923 the various funds controlled by the Currency Commissioners were amalgamated into one fund styled the Currency Guarantee Fund.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China; the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; the Mercantile Bank of India Limited; the Netherlands Trading Society; the National City Bank of New York; the Banque de l'Indo Chine; the Netherlands India Commercial Bank; and Sze Hai Tong Banking and Insurance Company, Bank of Taiwan, Chinese Commercial Bank, The Yokohama Specie Bank, The Ho Hong Bank, The Oversea Chinese Bank, the China Southern Bank, Lee Wah Bank, the P. and O. Banking Corporation, Thomas Cook & Son (Bankers) Limited, and Kwong Lee Banking Corporation.

The first-mentioned Bank is allowed under its Charter to issue notes, but none have been issued since 1909. The amount of notes of local banks in circulation at the end of 1927 was $139,585 only.

In addition to bank-notes a Government Currency Note issue was introduced in 1899. The amount of notes in circulation at the undermentioned dates was as follows:

Notes in circulation 31st Aug., 1909—$27,569,475
" " 31st Dec., 1920—$101,587,186
" " 1926—$163,279,713
" " 1927—$117,804,414

These notes circulate freely within the Colony and the Federated Malay States, and are largely used in North Borneo.

There is a Post Office Savings Bank at each Settlement. On 31st December, 1926, the deposits amounted to $3,462,436.

LABUAN.

The Island of Labuan is situated on the north-west coast of Borneo, in 5° 16' N. lat., and 115° 15' E. long. Its area is 30·25 square miles. It is distant from the coast, at the nearest point, about six miles; from Brunei, the capital of the Protected State of that name, about forty miles; and from Singapore 725 miles, or three days' steam.

The average annual rainfall is about 150 inches, and the thermometer ranges from 71° to 93°.

An attempt was made by the East India Company's servants, who were expelled from Balambangan by Sulu pirates in 1775, to establish a trading station in Labuan, but the project was soon abandoned, and for practical purposes the history of the island begins with its cession to Great Britain in 1846 by the Sultan of Brunei. It was then uninhabited. The reason for the cession, given in the treaty by which the island was handed over to Great Britain, was that it was "desirable that British ships shall have some port where they may careen and refit, and deposit such stores and merchandise as shall be necessary for the carrying on of the trade with the dominions of Brunei," and the consideration given by Great Britain was an undertaking to suppress piracy and protect lawful trade.

The island was first occupied only as a naval station under the control of a naval officer, and the formal establishment of a Crown Colony was deferred until 1848. From that date until the end of 1889 Labuan was governed as a separate Colony. Until 1869 it was assisted by grants-in-aid from the Imperial Exchequer, but this help was then withdrawn, and the Colony supported itself, though with difficulty, for the next twenty years. In 1889, the financial troubles came to a head, and, as it was thought that the island could be more economically governed in connection with the territories of the British North Borneo Company, the administration was entrusted, from the 1st January, 1890, to the care of the Company, whose principal representative in Borneo was given a commission as Governor of Labuan. This arrangement was terminated at the end of 1906, when Sir J. Anderson, Governor of the Straits Settlements, was appointed also Governor of Labuan, the island still remaining a separate Colony. On the 1st of January, 1907, Labuan was annexed to the Straits Settlements, and declared part of the settlement of Singapore. On the 1st of December, 1912, the island was constituted a separate Settlement.

When the Colony of Labuan was first founded great hopes of the success of the new settlement were based upon the existence of rich coal deposits in the island, but hitherto the companies formed to develop these coal resources have not met with great success. In 1893, the Central Borneo Company was re-constructed under the name of the New Central Borneo Company, who transferred their undertaking to the Labuan and Borneo Company. This Company, in its turn, was succeeded on the 8th December, 1902, by the Labuan Coalfields Company, Limited. The mines have been closed since the beginning of 1911.

Labuan has a fine port (Victoria Harbour), perfectly safe, and easy of access. Vessels drawing 15 feet can go alongside the coaling jetties. Ships are supplied with water at $1 per ton.

Labuan is a market for much of the produce of the neighbouring coasts of Borneo and the Sulu Archipelago, such as sago, beeswax, edible birds' nests, camphor, gutta-percha, indiarubber, rattans, tortoise-shell, and béche-de-mer, which are forwarded by the Labuan traders to Singapore. Cattle and goats are reared, and over 2,000 acres are estimated to be under cultivation. There are sago factories in the island, where the raw material received from the coast is converted into sago flour, which is exported to Singapore.

There is a branch of the Government Post Office Savings Bank in Labuan, but no other bank. The currency is Straits dollars and Straits subsidiary coins. Straits notes are also available in Labuan.

The inhabitants are chiefly Malays and other natives from Brunei and the mainland of Borneo, and Chinese, the latter being mostly petty traders.

There are three Government schools, viz:—The Government English School, the Vernacular School, Victoria, and the Vernacular School, Bukit Kallam. In addition there are three or four private schools, mostly managed by Chinese.
A reservoir owned by the Government supplies the town of Victoria and shipping with drinking water.

The Eastern Extension, Australasian and China Telegraph Company has a station on the island connected by cable with Singapore, Hong Kong and North Borneo. The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Singapore.

A weekly service of steamers plying between Singapore, North Borneo Ports and the Philippines provides Labuan with regular communication with these places; there are, in addition, local coasting steamers.

A rifle range affords facilities for H.M. ships exercising their crews.

The chief sources of revenue are harbour dues, land rents and licences.

**THE FEDERATED STATES OF THE MALAY PENINSULA.**

The Federated Malay States comprise four States: Perak, Selangor, Negri Sembilan, and Pahang.

**Perak.**

Perak is ruled by a dynasty that claims descent from the last Malay Sultan of Malacca. In the 17th century it was overrun by the Achenese, and at some time after 1636 a Johore prince, the husband of a Perak princess, was sent by Achen to rule it under the title of Sultan Mudzaffar Shah. From 1650 onwards, the Dutch endeavoured to get a monopoly of the tin exported from Perak, establishing near the mouth of the Perak river several factories, which the Malays, from time to time, cut off and destroyed. In 1765 the Sultan made a treaty with the Dutch.

British influence began early in the 19th century. A treaty with Penang in 1818 secured to British subjects the right to free trade in Perak. In 1825 a British arbitrator settled the boundary between Perak and Selangor. By the Burney Treaty with Siam, in 1826, the independence of Perak and Selangor was recognised, though the Sultan of Perak was permitted to send tribute to Siam if he desired. In the same year the Sultan ceded to the British the Dindings and the island of Pangkor as posts for the suppression of piracy, and agreed to rely solely on the protection of Great Britain. From 1872 to 1874 there was almost continuous fighting of more or less severity between rival factions of Chinese in the Larut district where valuable tin deposits had been found.

Having regard to the anarchy which prevailed, Sir Andrew Clarke, in 1874, induced the Perak chiefs to sign the Pangkor Treaty (20th January, 1874), and to accept thereby a Resident whose advice should be "asked and acted upon on all questions other than those touching Malay religion and customs." The murder of the first British Resident (Mr. J. W. Birch) in 1875 led to a military expedition and the banishment of the Sultan and some chiefs implicated in the affair. The country soon settled; and the Malay constitution was restored under a Sultan protected by the British Government.

**Selangor.**

In the 14th century, Klang, which is now a district of Selangor, is said to have been subject to the Javanese Empire of Majapahit. In the next century it was given a Penghulu of the family of the Bendaharas of old Malacca, and a son of Sultan Mansur Shah (1468-1477 A.D.) of Malacca was made ruler of Jeram, near Langat. During the period of Portuguese ascendancy, little is known of the Selangor coast. The Dutch opened factories for the purchase of tin at Kuala Selangor and at Kuala Linggi. In 1718 Daeng Chelak, a Bugis chief, who had married a Johore princess, settled at Kuala Selangor, and about 1780 their descendant was recognized as Sultan Salehud-din by the Sultan of Perak. The throne has remained in the same family ever since. In 1783, the Dutch blockaded Kuala Selangor and forced the Sultan to acknowledge the suzerainty of Holland.

In 1818 the Sultan of Selangor made a commercial treaty with the East India Company at Penang. In 1874 anarchy prevailed amongst the Malay chiefs at Selangor, and pirates ravaged the coastal trade. The Sultan's difficulties were such that he was glad to accept a British Resident, and to come under the protection of Great Britain.

**Negri Sembilan.**

This federation of "Nine States" consists of the four major States of Sungai Ujong, Jelebu, Johol, and Rembau, and the five minor States of Ulu Muar, Jempul, Terasi, Gunong Pasir, and Inas. Sungai Ujong is mentioned in a Javanese poem in 1365 as being subject to the Javanese Empire of Majapahit. In the 15th century it was ruled by Chiefs of the old kingdom of Malacca. Nearly all the Malay inhabitants of the "Nine States" are descendants from immigrants from Menangkabau in Sumatra. Portuguese accounts prove that this immigration had begun in the 16th century. The original Malay federation consisted of Sungai Ujong, Klang (now a district of Selangor), Jelebu, Rembau, Naning (now part of Malacca), Segamat (now in Johore), Pasir Besar (also in Johore, its place having been taken by Johol), Jelai (now Inas) and Ulu Pahang, the region between the Ulu Serting and Temerloh. After the wresting of Malacca from the Portuguese by the Dutch and the Johore Malays in 1641, Johore took a leading part in Negri Sembilan politics until 1773, when the chiefs of the four major States brought from Sumatra a Yam Tuan named Raja Melewar, ancestor of the present Yang di-pertuan Besar.

In 1874, the Dato' Klana, Chief of Sungai Ujong, the most important of the "Nine States," invited and obtained the assistance of the British Government to maintain his rule and the appointment of a British Resident. In 1883, Jelebu applied for a British Officer; and Rembau agreed to refer all its disputes to the British Government, and in 1887 accepted a British adviser. In 1889, the Yam Tuan of Sri Menanti and the Rulers of Tampin and Rembau asked for a Resident, and
agreed to a confederation known as "The Old Negri Sembilan." In 1895, the Resident of this confederation took charge of Sungai Ujong and of Jelebu, and the modern Negri Sembilan was constituted. Finally, in 1898, the Yam Tuan of Sri Menanti was elected titular Ruler of the whole State.

Pahang.

Chao Ju Kua, a Chinese, writing about 1225, mentions Pahang as being subject to the old Sumatran Buddhist Kingdom of Sri Vijaya. Later, Pahang and Tioman are claimed as conquests of Majapahit. In the 15th century, Sultan Mansur Shah of Malacca captured the Ruler of Pahang, and married his daughter. Before the Malacca royal house died out, in 1699, its Pahang branch provided several Rulers for the senior throne of Johore, which directly represented the Malacca dynasty. Later, Pahang fell under the suzerainty of the new Sultans of Johore, who, when they removed to Lingga, left a Dato' Bendahara in charge of Pahang.

In 1887 Sir Frederick Weld negotiated a treaty with the Bendahara of Pahang, promising British help in the event of external attack, and arranging for a British agent to be stationed at his capital. At the same time, the title of Sultan was substituted for that of Dato' Bendahara. In 1888, the Sultan applied for and obtained British protection, and the appointment of a Resident.

Constitution of the States.

The supreme authority in each State is vested in the Sultan, or the ruler, in State Council. His Highness the Sultan or the ruler presides over the State Council. The British Resident is a member, and, in Perak and in Selangor, the Secretary to Resident is also a member. The other members consist of members of the royal family, the leading chiefs and some Chinese. Since the creation of a Federal Council, the State Councils legislate only on matters affecting the State.

The Residents are appointed by the Secretary of State and are subordinate to the Chief Secretary and to the High Commissioner for the Malay States, who is also the Governor of the Straits Settlements. They are assisted by a staff of European officers, whose duty it is to carry out the executive functions. The administration of each State is carried on, as far as may be, on the Colonial System.

The Federation.

In 1895 a treaty was signed by the rulers of the four States, by which they agreed to constitute their countries a Federation (to be known as the Federated Malay States), to be administered under the advice of the British Government. While all existing treaties and arrangements were to stand, the States agreed to the appointment of an officer, to be styled Resident-General of the Malay States* to control the Residents appointed to each State, and to be the means of communication between the State Governments and the High Commissioner. They agreed to follow the Resident-General's advice in all matters of administration other than those touching Islam. Subject to the authority created by the appointment of the Resident-General, the system of administration under the advice of British Residents remained unchanged.

The States undertook to give each other material assistance in men and money, the wealthier States assisting those in want of help, and all moneys so advanced being considered as loans; and also undertook to raise and equip a force of Indian troops for service throughout the States, and to supply a portion of these troops on requisition for the defence of the Colony of the Straits Settlements, should Great Britain be at war with any foreign Power.

It was also provided by the Treaty of 1895 that the rulers of the Federated States should meet periodically in one of the States, under the presidency of the High Commissioner, to discuss affairs of mutual interest. The first of these meetings was held at Kuala Kangsar, Perak, in July, 1897, and was attended by the High Commissioner, the rulers of all the four States, with their most important chiefs, the Resident-General, and all the British Residents. At this meeting many important matters were discussed and arrangements made to deal with them in the councils of the various States.

The second meeting was held at Kuala Lumpur in July, 1903, and at it the Sultan of Perak expressed for himself and the other Malay rulers entire satisfaction with the administration of affairs.

No further meetings of this nature have been held since 1903, as the necessity for them has been removed by an important development of the principle of Federation, which was introduced in 1909. In that year a Federal Council was created by an agreement between the High Commissioner and the four native rulers. The object in view, as stated in the preamble to the agreement, was to provide means "for the joint arrangement of all matters of common interest to the Federation or affecting more than one State and for the proper enactment of all laws intended to have force throughout the Federation or in more than one State." The Federal Council consists of the High Commissioner, as President, the Chief Secretary to Government, the Sultans of Perak, Selangor and Pahang, the Yam Tuan of Negri Sembilan, the four British Residents, the Legal Adviser, the Financial Advisor, and six unofficial members, nominated by the High Commissioner with the approval of the King. Provision is made in the agreement for the addition, if desired, of the heads of one or more public departments and of a corresponding number of unofficials. The Federal Council generally meets three times a year and considers the drafts of laws, which are to apply to more than one State, and the annual estimates of the revenue and expenditure of the four States. The first meeting of the Council was opened on the 11th of December, 1909, at Kuala Kangsar.

Climate.

The temperature of the West Coast of the Malay Peninsula has but a small daily range and little appreciable variation. On the East Coast, however, the North-East Monsoon, lasting from November to March, causes a distinct meteorological contrast with the rest of the year as regards wind and rainfall. At Jelebu in Negri Sembilan, the driest station where records were kept, the average for 1891-1927 was 64 inches, but in the mountains the average yearly rainfall is very high (250 inches near Taiping). The heat, owing to the moisture of the atmosphere, is at times oppressive, although 100° has never been recorded in the shade. The nights are cool. On the highest mountains, the temperature has been known to fall at nights to 46° Fahrenheit. In the daytime, there is almost always a breeze to

modify the heat. The Peninsula lies within the region of the South-West and the North-East Monsoons, but owing to the barrier provided by Sumatra, the only really strong wind is the North-East Monsoon, which strikes the East Coast from across the China Sea. Violent squalls, known as "Sumatras," are not infrequent on the West Coast of the Peninsula between April and September. Generally, they are of short duration and occur during the night.

**Population.**

At the 1921 census, the population of the Federated Malay States was 1,324,890. Of this population 853,528 were males and 471,362 females.

The Malay population rose from 420,840 in 1911 to 510,821 in 1921, an increase of 21·3 per cent. The very high rate of increase in Selangor (41·3 per cent) was due to the influx of foreign Malays, who have settled in the Coast Districts to plant rubber.

The Chinese population of the Federated Malay States was 494,048 or only 61,304 more than in 1911. Practically the whole of this increase was in Chinese females, who now number 351 to 1,000 males as compared with 118 in 1911, and the lessening disparity between the sexes among the Chinese indicates a general tendency towards their permanent settlement in the Federated Malay States.

The Indian population rose from 58,386 in 1901 to 172,465 in 1911, the increase synchronising with the early development of the rubber planting industry, and to 306,219 in 1921. The percentages of increase since 1911 were 77·2 in Perak, 78·9 in Selangor, 84·4 in Negri Sembilan, and 31·4 in Pahang. More than four-fifths of the Indians in the Federated Malay States are Tamils.

The European population of the Federated Malay States rose from 3,284 in 1911 to 5,686 in 1921, of whom 93·2 per cent. were of British nationality.

**Railways.**

The Federated Malay States Government owns the railways both in the Federated Malay States and the Colony of the Straits Settlements (Singapore Island, Malacca, and Province Wellesley) and also in the Unfederated States of Kedah, Perlis and Kelantan. It has leased the Johore State Railway (120 miles), extending from Johore Bahru at the Southern extremity of the Peninsula and opposite Singapore, to Gemas on the boundary between Johore and the Federated Malay States. At Gemas, the line branches into the West Coast and the East Coast Lines; the West Coast Line runs North-North-West through Negri Sembilan, Selangor, Perak and Province Wellesley to Prai—the port opposite Penang Harbour—488 miles from Singapore. From Bukit Mertajam near Prai the line proceeds Northwards through the Unfederated States of Kedah and Perlis, to the Siamese frontier station of Padang Besar, 580 miles from Singapore. Through traffic with the Siamese State Railways was opened on July 1st, 1918, the distance between Singapore and Bangkok being 1,188 miles. Through services are in operation between Penang and Bangkok, the journey occupying 34 hours.

The East Coast Line proceeds Northward from Gemas through Negri Sembilan and Pahang towards Tumpat. It is completed and opened for traffic as far as Merapoh, 43 miles beyond Kuala Lipis, the capital of Pahang, and 184 miles from Gemas. Construction is in progress North of Merapoh, the rails have crossed the Pahang-Kelantan frontier at 187½ miles and have been laid to the 199th mile.

On the North in Kelantan a section of 63 miles from Tumpat—the terminus on the East Coast—to Manek Urai is open for traffic, and construction Southwards is in progress, rails having been laid as far as the 72nd mile and between the 76th and 82nd miles. Guillemand Bridge, across the Kelantan River about 35 miles from Tumpat, is the largest bridge in Malaya. It is 2,666 feet long, and has five spans of 250 feet, and five spans of 150 feet. This line will eventually meet the East Coast line from Gemas and provide through direct communication with Singapore and Kelantan. The distance between railheads in Kelantan is about 50 miles.

An extension from Pasir Mas in Kelantan runs in a westerly direction for 12 miles on the Golok River at the Siamese Boundary, where it joins with the Siamese line running to Haad Yai Junction, where a junction is made with the main Bangkok-Penang line.

Through working between the Federated Malay States and Kelantan via the Siamese State Railways commenced on November 1st, 1921.

Branch lines connect the main line with the ports on the West Coast at Malacca, Port Dickson, Port Swettenham, Teluk Anson Wharf and Port Weld.

A causeway carrying two lines of rails and a roadway has been built across the Johore Strait, connecting the Island of Singapore with the Peninsula.

The total length of line now open to traffic under the Federated Malay States Railway Administration is 1,105 miles.

The line is of metre gauge. On the mail trains on the West Coast main line there are sleeping saloons and restaurant cars. The expenditure on the capital account (including lines not open for traffic), was £211,581,362 up to 31st December, 1927, all of which, with the exception of £39,690,589 from loan funds, has been met from the general revenues of the Federated Malay States.

**Roads.**

The mileage of main roads maintained by the Public Works Department is 2,598, of which 904 miles have been treated with bituminous compound, and is made up as follows:

| State       | Total Miles | Mileage which has received bituminous treatment |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Perak       | 882         | 364                                           |
| Selangor    | 836         | 262                                           |
| Negri Sembilan | 482     | 188                                           |
| Pahang      | 398         | 90                                            |

Total: 2,598 miles. 904 miles.

These roads are metalled and steam-rolled and connect up every township of importance throughout the whole of the Federated Malay States. The cost of maintenance in 1927 was £3,834,550 or an average of £1,476 (£172) per mile. There are, in addition, 113 miles of unmetalled roads and nearly 2,000 miles of bridle roads and paths.

The gradient of these main roads seldom exceeds 1 in 30 and in two instances they lead over the mountain passes of "The Gap," 2,500 feet, and "Ginting Simpah," 2,000 feet.

The highest elevation so far reached by a main road is 4,250 feet, at Fraser's Hill, a health resort.
Posts, Savings Bank, Telegraphs and Telephones.

A well organised system of Posts extends throughout the Federated Malay States by rail, motor car, cycle, runner, sea, and river. All towns and villages of any size have their regular deliveries and collections of mail matter and these facilities are being extended rapidly. The external mail services are frequent to all other ports of the world through Port Swettenham and through the Straits Settlements ports Singapore and Penang. The postal services include Parcel Post, Cash on Delivery (or Value Payable Post); Insurance, Money Orders, British Postal Orders, all these services extend to a great many different countries. They are operated at 102 Post Offices by officers of the Posts and Telegraphs Department and at 68 other places by station-masters and others. Savings Bank business is transacted at all Post Offices at all hours at which they are open, the Bank being controlled by the Department. The interest payable on deposits is 3 per cent.

Telegraph lines connect all the Post Offices and 40 of the "Postal Agencies" (i.e. offices operated by Station Masters and others) with a main trunk system throughout the Peninsula, and through Singapore and Penang with the rest of the world by submarine cable and by wireless. The Department has its own telegraph lines through the State of Johore connecting the Federated Malay States with Singapore. Local lines connect offices in Johore, Kedah, and Trengganu with offices in the Federated Malay States and there is a line connecting Betong in Siam with Kroh in the Federated Malay States.

The Telephone system extends throughout the Federated Malay States. There are at present 46 public exchanges maintaining a continuous night and day service and 38 other places at which Call Offices are maintained giving a service restricted to the hours during which the local Post Office is open for the transaction of public business. Of the Post Offices in the Federated Malay States, 84, therefore, are provided with public telephone facilities. At most of the remaining places calls, including trunk calls, can, in case of emergency, be made from the local Police Stations.

The public exchanges are situated at Bagan Serai, Batu Gajah, Bidor, Gopeng, Ipoh, Kampar, Kuala Kangsar, Maxwells Hill, Menglembu, Parit, Parit Buntar, Pusing, Sitiawan, Sungai Siput, Sungkai, Taiping, Tanjong Malim, Tapah, Teluk Anson, and Utan Melintang in Perak; at Banting, Batang Berjuntai, Bentong, Gap, Kajang, Klang, Kuala Kubu, Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Selangor, Port Swettenham, Rawang, Rasa and Semenyih in Selangor; at Bahau, Batang Malaka, Jelebu, Kuala Pilah, Nilai, Port Dickson, Rantau, Rembau, Seremban, and Tampin in Negri Sembilan; and at Fraser's Hill, Kuala Lipis, and Raub in Pahang.

All the exchanges are connected by means of trunk lines and trunk communication (which may also be obtained from Call Offices) is possible between all but the most distant exchanges. In case of emergency trunk calls may be made from the local Police Stations when the Call Offices are closed.

The Federated Malay States telephone system is connected to the telephone system in Malacca (and through Malacca with North Johore) and with the telephone system in Penang and Province Wellesley.

There are 2,602 miles of telegraph and telephone lines in the Federated Malay States with an overhead wire mileage of 21,716 miles. In addition there are 102 miles of underground cables with a wire mileage of 9,908 miles. The Department also has 123 miles of telegraph line with a wire mileage of 606 miles in the State of Johore.

The details and figures furnished above are taken up to the 31st December, 1927.

Pérak.

H.H. Paduka Sri Sultan Iskandar Shah, K.C.M.G., K.C.V.O., ibni Idris, Sultan.

Pérak is the most northerly of the Protected States on the west coast, touching Province Wellesley on the north and Selangor on the south. About 1850 the discovery of tin in Larut was followed by the immigration of Chinese in great numbers. Since the appointment of a British Resident in 1874, the record of the State has been one of remarkable progress.

The State, is well watered, the Pérak (with its tributaries, the Singor, the Temengor, the Rui, the Plus), the Kinta, Batang Padang, Bidor and Sungkai, being the most important rivers. Other rivers of importance are the Krian, the Kurau and the Bernam (with its tributary, the Slim). The mountains on the east boundary, which are part of the main range of the Peninsula, rise to a height of over 7,000 feet.

Sanatoria have been established on the Larut Hills, on Gunong Kledang, and on Gunong Arang Para, at heights varying from 3,300 to
Experimental gardens with English flowers and vegetables are to be found on the Larut Hills.

The chief exports are tin and rubber. Coconuts and rice are extensively grown. In the Krian district the Government has completed an extensive scheme for the irrigation of more than 74,102 acres of land, the larger proportion of which is already under cultivation for rice.

Larut, Kinta, Batang Padang, and Klian Intan are the chief mining districts. The district of Batang Padang lies between the Kinta Valley and the Selangor boundary, and contains a little gold and wolfram mixed with its tin.

The total mileage of completed roads in Perak is (a) 885 of metalled and (b) 40 of unmetalled cart roads, 1,138 miles of bridle and other paths.

The British Resident has residences at Taiping, the Head Quarters of Government, and at Ipoh, the chief commercial centre. The chief towns are Ipoh, Taiping, Kuala Kangsar, Kampar, and Tapah. The chief port is Teluk Anson.

Since the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909 the territory claimed by Perak for many years, and held by Patani since 1826, has been formally ceded to Perak, and the State now includes the whole watershed of the river that gives it its name. The new territory, which was taken over on the 16th July, 1909, and incorporated in the Upper Perak District, exceeds 1,000 square miles in area. It extends from Kedah on the West to Legoh on the East, and contains the tin mines of Klian Intan and much good stanniferous country. This territory is well watered, and the rolling plains of the Kroh plateau, 1,000 feet above the sea, afford a healthy Government station. At Tasik on the Kedah border there is a small natural lake. At the time when the territory was taken over the population was about 3,000 of various nationalities.

Selangor.

H.H. Ala'idin Suleiman Shah, K.C.M.G., ibni Al-Merhum Raja Muda Musa, Sultan.

Selangor situated on the Western side of the Peninsula, is bounded on the North by Perak, on the East and South-east by Pahang and Negri Sembilan, and on the West by the Straits of Malacca.

Its coast line extends for about 125 miles. Where the State touches the central range of the Peninsula there are several peaks of over 5,000 feet and one of 5,812 feet.

The State is drained by four rivers: The Bernam, forming the boundary between Perak and Selangor, the Selangor, the Klang and the Langat. The natives are said to be the descendants of a Colony from the Celebes.

For administrative purposes the State is divided into six districts—viz., Kuala Lumpur, Klang, Ulu Langat, Ulu Selangor, Kuala Langat and Kuala Selangor, each under a British District Officer.

The capital of the State is Kuala Lumpur, which is also the headquarters of the administration of the Federated Malay States. It is the largest town on the mainland of the Peninsula, with a population of 80,366 (1921 Census). It has a water supply from an impounding reservoir 7 miles distant, and is also lighted by electricity. There are 90 miles of town streets. It also possesses a picturesque public garden covering about 180 acres, and several imposing Government buildings, the principal being the Government offices of modern Saracenic design, with a clock tower 130 feet high, town hall, museum, courts, prison, railway station and offices, and post office. There are also branches of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, and the Mercantile Bank of India. The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar, with a fixed exchange at two shillings and fourpence.

There were 260 schools in the State in 1927, including four Government English Schools, 78 Government Vernacular Schools, 165 Grant-in-aid Vernacular Schools and 10 Grant-in-aid English Schools.

Port Swettenham, situated at the mouth of the Klang River and 27 miles by rail from Kuala Lumpur, is the chief port, and is regularly visited by ocean-going steamers. The aggregate tonnage of vessels, exclusive of native craft, which called at the port in 1927 was 2,907,249.

The total revenue of the State in 1927, was $38,769,934, and the expenditure, $35,342,685.

There is no public debt except such as is included in the public debt of the Federation.

The principal sources of revenue are customs, excise, and land. Import duties are charged on spirituous liquors, wines, beers, petroleum, tobacco, matches and alum. In 1927 the gross total value of imports was $96,202,065, and exports $116,562,104.

The chief industry of the State is tin mining. The amount of tin exported in 1927 was 14,337 tons, valued at $34,784,786. The area alienated for mining is 55,279 acres. Coffee planting under European supervision made good progress some years ago, but has now been almost entirely abandoned. There are 96,370 acres under coconuts. Rice, gambier, pepper and other products are grown with success. Of recent years the cultivation of rubber has made great strides. Most of the large estates have been converted into or sold to limited liability companies. At the end of 1927 the area under rubber cultivation was approximately 475,924 acres. The value of cultivated rubber exported during 1927 was $68,151,117.

The road mileage is: metalled cart roads, 835; unmetalled cart roads, 40; and bridle paths, 83 miles.

Negri Sembilan (Nine States).

H.H. Muhammad, K.C.M.G., K.C.V.O., ibni Almerhum Antsh, Yang di Pertuan Besar.

The Federation of States known as the Negri Sembilan lies on the Western side of the Peninsula and is bounded on the North-west by Selangor, on the North-east by Pahang, on the East by Johore, on the South by Malacca, and on the South-west by the sea.

The headquarters of the Resident are at Seremban in Sungai Ujong, where the principal Government offices are situated. District officers are stationed at Port Dickson, at Kuala Klawang in Jelebu, at Ulu Muar in Kuala Pilah, and at Tampin.

The value of imports amounted to $13,479,269 in 1927, and that of exports to $41,536,479. The revenue of the State, which in 1927 amounted to $13,397,275, is derived mainly from tin mining and agriculture.

At the end of 1927, 7,260 acres of land were in occupation for mining, and 491,011 acres for building and agriculture. The alluvial tin fields are worked and owned by Chinese, whilst the hydraulic and other workings requiring the installation of expensive machinery are supervised and financed by Europeans. Gold reefs
exist in Gemencheh and on the Muar River, but have not up to the present proved remunerative. The Malay population is almost entirely agricultural. By far the larger portion of this population inhabits the Kuala Pilah and Tampin districts, where there are extensive and fertile rice fields. The Malays, however, merely aim at supplying their own needs and do not cultivate for export or even for the supply of the Chinese and other foreign immigrants.

The chief agricultural products are rubber, rice, and coco-nuts.

During 1927 the areas under cultivation with these products were approximately as follows:— Rubber 331,283 acres, rice 30,700 acres, and coco-nuts 29,590 acres.

Coffee is very little grown now, and its place has been taken by rubber. The cultivation of rubber has increased very greatly of late years, and there is now a considerable European planting community in the State.

As regards educational facilities, the State possesses 83 Malay vernacular schools, eight English schools and 68 Tamil schools.

The State is provided with a good system of roads, connecting the centres of each district with headquarters and each other. The total mileage is 481 miles of metalled and 10 miles of unmetalled cart roads, together with 272 miles of bridle paths, which provide access to outlying portions of the districts.

A great part of the State is mountainous, the rest consisting of undulating country suitable for agriculture. The whole State is well watered, the chief rivers being the Muar and the Linggi, the latter of which forms, for some distance, the boundary between the State and the Settlement of Malacca.

Much valuable timber is found in the forests of the State, and the areas of reserved forests are being considerably extended with a view to its preservation.

Pahang.

H.H. Al-Moktasim Billah Al-Sultan Abdullah, K.C.M.G., umi Al-Marhum Al-Sultan Ahmad Al-Muazzam Shah, Sultan.

Pahang occupies a large portion of that part of the Malay Peninsula which lies on the eastern side of the central mountain range. It is bounded on the North by the States of Kelantan and Trengganu, on the South by the territory of Johore, on the West and South-west by Perak, Selangor, and the Negri Sembilan, and on the East by the China Sea. It is the largest of the States of the Federation.

Several peaks of the main range of mountains forming the western boundary exceed 6,000 feet, the highest being Gunong Kerbau, which is 7,160 feet. Gunong Tahan, in the centre of the Pahang-Kelantan boundary, has been found to be 7,186 feet high, and is therefore the highest elevation in the Federated Malay States, and probably in the Malay Peninsula.

The State is drained by one of the largest rivers in the Peninsula, if not the largest, the Pahang River, which is fed by the Lipis, Jelai, Tembeling, Semantan, Triang, Bera, Luat, Lepar and other rivers. To the north the Kuantan and to the south the Rompin and Endau also debouch into the China Sea, the last named forming part of the boundary between Pahang and Johore.

The total length of the Pahang River is about 286 miles, of which 232 are navigable for house-boats and other small craft. The bars at the mouth of all rivers, with the exception of the Kuantan, prevent the ingress of vessels except those of very shallow draft.

The chief industry of the State, after agriculture, is tin mining, the principal mines being in the Bentong, Raub and Kuantan districts. Gold has been worked for many years by the Raub Australian Gold Mining Company, Limited. Gold-bearing lodes have also been worked by Europeans at Penjum, Selensing, Kechau, and other places in the State; the mines have been closed for some years. From the reports of old travellers it is clear that in the eighteenth and previous centuries very large quantities of alluvial gold were exported from Pahang. The European mines mentioned above were all on the sites of extensive native workings.

The administrative headquarters of the State are at Kuala Lipis, 209 miles up stream from the mouth of the Pahang River.

The Sultan, however, resides at Pekan, the old capital, which is near the mouth of the Pahang River.

The East Coast line of the Federated Malay States Railways was opened for traffic as far as Chigar Perah, 23 miles north of Kuala Lipis in 1923, and on 5th December, 1927, this line was extended from Chegar Perah to Merapoh, a distance of 21 miles.

There is a motor service both ways from Kuala Kubu to Kuala Lipis, 83 miles; also four times weekly from Jerantut Station on the Railway to Kuantan, a distance of 109 miles.

Roads from Bentong to Kuala Pilah in Negri Sembilan (104 miles), from Bentong to Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Selangor (50 miles), via the Ginting Sempah Pass, and from Benta to Kuantan (147½ miles), have been completed. There is also a metalled cart road from Raub to the Pahang Rubber Company's estate at Sungai Cheroh, a distance of 10 miles. A road from Temerloh to Bentong (49 miles) has been completed. The total mileage of metalled roads in Pahang is 857.

The total revenue of the State during 1927 amounted to $7,222,539, and the expenditure to $8,235,129.

There are 5 English Schools 65 Malay Boys' Schools, 3 Malay Girls' Schools and 7 Tamil Schools in the State.

MALAY STATES NOT INCLUDED IN THE FEDERATION.

In addition to the territories comprised in the Federated Malay States, the British sphere in the Malay Peninsula includes the States of Johore, Kedah, Perlia, Kelantan, and Trengganu.

JOHORE.

His Highness Sir Ibrahim, G.C.M.G., K.B.E.,
etc., etc., Sultan and Sovereign Ruler of the State and Territories of Johore.

The State of Johore lies at the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula, and is bounded on the north by Pahang, on the north-west by Negri Sembilan and Malacca, on the west by the Straits of Malacca, on the south by the Strait north of Singapore, and on the east by the China Sea.

The area of the State is approximately 7,500 square miles. The interior is in great part covered with jungle. The country is, as a whole, less mountainous than any other part of the Peninsula. The most important mountain group is formed by the Blumut Hills, which lie near the centre of the State. Mount Ophir, or Gunong Ledang, the highest peak in Johore (4,186 feet), is situated near the border of Malacca.

The principal river is the Muar, in the north-west, running through the district of the same name, which was formerly a separate State, but was united to Johore in 1877. The only other rivers of importance are the Endau, in the north, which, during part of its course, forms the boundary with Pahang, and the Johore, which flows into the Straits opposite to the eastern end of the island of Singapore.

The only towns of any importance are Johore Bahru, the capital, situated on the Straits opposite to Singapore, Bandar Maharani in Muar, and Bandar Penggaram in Batu Pahat.

The climate approximates to that of Singapore and the Federated Malay States, the highest maximum and lowest minimum temperature in 1926 being 96° and 65° respectively.

A recent estimate places the total population at 321,000; at the last census in 1921, the Malay inhabitants were found to constitute 86 per cent. of the total, and the population of Johore Bahru Town was returned as 15,312.

In area, Johore approximates to Wales; in population to Cyprus; though the area, revenue, and trade of Johore are twice, thrice, and seven times respectively that of Cyprus.

History.

Of Johore history little is known prior to the advent of the Portuguese; moreover, the authorities differ regarding even such major points as the probable cradle of the Malay race. The "Semang" (Negrito aborigines) and "Sakai" (Indo-Chinese immigrants) who may have attained some degree of civilization, have been driven to the hills; a number of semi-wild "proto-Malay" tribes exist chiefly along the coasts; while the regular occupants of the country are the descendants of the Malays who brought their civilization from Palembang in Sumatra about the 13th century.

Prior to that, the country though unoccupied was much visited: the Dravidians of South India are responsible for several place-names: they were followed by Arabs and Near-Eastern merchants, and later by Phoenicians and others from the Western world, before the Christian era. It has been surmised that King Solomon's mariners visited Mount Ophir in Johore.

The village of Tebrau may have given its name to the Straits of Tumeras, and the Tamarus promontorium (Ramunia Point) of Strabo.

Certainly, since the first century when the peninsula probably obtained its present form, Johore (Ujong Tanah, Land's End) must have been a salient feature on the voyage from India to China.

In the 9th century the Arabs regularly visited the mart of Betumah, situated near the Straits, to collect the camphor and other valuable products which filtered down from the Endau district.

As the Buddhist State of Palembang grew in power, colonies of Malays commenced to settle on the Peninsula. The "Ma-li-yu-erh" of Chinese writers had, in 1295, been long at variance with Siam. Marco Polo (1292) mentions the city of Malavir. Singapore, founded under the name of Tamasik about this time, was ruled by its own kings. A Siamese law of 1360 includes Ujong Tanah, Malaka, and Malayu among tributary states. One Raja Chulan, who reigned over the south of the Peninsula, had a fort of black stone on the Johore River.

This nascent development was nipped in the bud by the invasion of the Javanese from Majapahit, who in 1377 conquered the country and destroyed Singapore under circumstances of great brutality.

Malacca, however, grew to be the first trading centre of the East, and after its conquest by the Portuguese in 1511, the son of the conquered King settled at Johore Lama and founded the historic Sultanate of Johore.

The history of the next 300 years, however, is an almost uninterrupted record of wars. Persistent hostilities with the Portuguese continued nearly until the arrival of the Dutch in 1602. The State bears no small part in Dutch Colonial history; relations were friendly, despite a diplomatic struggle for commercial privileges. But, after violent attacks by the Achinese, Johore had become by 1637 practically an appanage of the Achinese kingdom. In return for assistance rendered at the successful attack on Malacca in
1641, the Dutch tried to restore Johore to its former position as the premier Malay State. A port with a customs officer existed at Singapore. But the capital was plundered and burnt by Jambi in 1673, in 1699 the Sultan was assassinated, and in 1717 the throne was seized by a Sumatran adventurer, Raja Kechil. Then the Bugis ships appeared. The subsequent process, partly conquest, partly assimilation, while disturbing to Johore, resulted in a wide extension of its sovereignty, which now spread to Pahang, Siak, Riau, Linggi and part of Selangor.

After 60 years of continuous intrigues between the Malay and Bugis chiefs the Dutch in 1784 recognised the Malay Sultan as ruler of Johore, drove the Bugis from Riau and stationed there a Resident with a garrison; after some further fighting the Malay Sultan and the Bugis viceroy accepted the position of dependent princes, but the old empire of Johore (Linggi and Klang had been ceded to the Dutch in 1757) was in a state of dissolution, the Bendahara and Temenggong being virtually territorial chiefs in Pahang and Johore respectively. This was the position when the English, by virtue of treaties made in 1819 and 1824, obtained a complete cession of the island of Singapore.

Contemporary visitors emphasize the deserted character of the country; in 1847 the capital consisted merely of 25 huts. (In 1855 the capital was moved to its present situation at Johore Bahru.) But the extension of the Pax Britannica and the assistance rendered by the Governor of the Straits Settlements “helped Johore to grow populous again,” moreover, the country has been governed since 1862 by two enlightened and progressive rulers, Sultan Abubakar, who died in 1895, and Sultan Ibrahim the present ruler.

In 1895 the Sultan undertook to receive a British Agent having the functions of a Consular Officer; in 1910, the Sultan having had an unofficial adviser for some years, reorganised his Government with the assistance of the Governor of the Straits Settlements; in 1914 a General Adviser with enlarged powers was appointed. The recent history of the State has been a record of continued prosperity. Telephonic communication was established between Johore and Singapore in 1883; a postal service was inaugurated in 1884, letters being transported by coach till the opening of the railway across Singapore Island in 1903; in 1909 the Johore State railway, linking up with the Federated Malay States Railway system, was completed; finally, in 1924, the completion of the causeway across the Straits permits uninterrupted railway connection between Singapore and Bangkok.

Constitution.

In 1895 the Sultan promulgated a written constitution, to which supplements have been added.

His Highness has a Council of Ministers, consisting entirely of high Malay Officers of State, together with an Executive Council consisting of certain Malay and British officers.

The Orders of the Executive Council are carried out by a Civil Service containing Malay and European Officers.

The Legislature consists of a Council of State, to which Asiatic and European official and unofficial members are appointed.

The Judicial system resembles that of the Federated Malay States, minor cases being decided by Magistrates, with appeal to the Supreme Court, and major cases by the Supreme Court, with appeal to the Court of Appeal, and thence in special cases to the Privy Council.

Cases involving matters regulated by Muhammadan law are decided in the Court of a Kathi, with appeal to the Sultan in Executive Council.

Judges of the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements and of the Federated Malay States are ex-officio Judges of the State of Johore, and vice versa.

Economic Conditions.

Johore recovered more quickly than the Federated Malay States from the trade depression which began in 1920; and an era of rapid development commenced.

The rise in revenue from two million dollars in 1909 to 18 million dollars in 1927 constitutes a record of progress which none of the other Malay States can equal.

Johore is primarily an agricultural State. Forest Reserves amount to 173 square miles and are being largely increased.

Forest produce valued at about 1,600,000 dollars was exported in 1927.

The total area of alienated land extends to some 975,640 acres.

The chief agricultural exports in 1927 were:

| Area. | Value of Exports. |
|-------|------------------|
| Rubber | 548,000 acres | $62,064,636 |
| Copra | 90,000 " | 5,499,841 |

with small areas of Sago, Tuba, Coffee, and Kapok.

Mining titles cover some 13,000 acres.

The principal minerals exported in 1927 were:

- Tin-ore, 16,373 pikuls.
- Iron-ore, 409,241 tons.
- China clay, 824 tons.

the total value of mineral exports amounting to $4,419,181.

The chief imports comprise rice, wines and spirits, tobacco, wood and timber (largely Johore Produce re-imported from Singapore), cotton-goods and petroleum products.
A branch of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation is established at Johore Bahru, and a Chinese bank at Muar.

Manufacturing industries are in their infancy, being confined to seven pineapple factories, a score of tapioca factories, and a few saw-mills, brickworks, and similar undertakings.

A larger electric power station is being erected at Johore Bahru; stations will shortly be erected at Muar and Segamat.

Communications.

Sea.—Regular steamship services run between the various coast ports and Singapore.

During 1927, 71 ocean-going steamers with a tonnage of 216,231; 3,973 coasting steamers with a tonnage of 199,489; and 3,052 sailing vessels with a tonnage of 100,392 entered and cleared from ports in the State.

There was a large increase in the number and tonnage of Japanese ocean-going steamers calling at Batu Pahat to load iron-ore.

Railway.—The Johore State Railway runs for 120 miles through the middle of the State from Gemas on the northern boundary to Johore Bahru on the southern boundary; it is connected on each boundary with the system of the Federated Malay States Railway administration, by whom it was built and to whom it is leased.

Road.—At the end of 1927, 115 miles of town roads and 531 miles of country roads were metalled. All the principal towns are now connected by a road-system which is being continually extended. Hired cars provide a cheap, constant, and rapid means of communication. About 1,200 motor vehicles a day cross the causeway connecting the mainland with Singapore Island.

Posts, Telegraphs, Telephones.—In addition to the General Post Office at Johore Bahru, 13 branch offices are established.

Twenty telephone exchanges are in operation, and the number will be increased. Communication is established between Johore Bahru and Singapore, and between Muar and the Malacca and Federated Malay States systems.

Accommodation.—The Johore Hotel at Johore Bahru provides the usual accommodation for travellers; the Government also maintains Rest Houses at Muar, Batu Pahat, Kota Tinggi, Segamat, Batu Anam, Mersing, and Kluang.

General.

Health.—Government Hospitals are established in the principal townships, besides a Mental Hospital and Leper Asylum at Johore Bahru. Permanent anti-malarial measures are being undertaken in Johore Bahru and Mersing; and oiling operations are in force in all towns.

Travelling dispensaries will shortly be provided.

Education.—The Government has established five English Schools and 84 vernacular schools, in addition to a Malay Training College for teachers; further, the Government maintains five advanced Malay students at Hongkong and in England.

Grants-in-aid are made to estate Tamil schools.

Military Forces.—The total strength of the Johore Military Forces in 1927 amounted to 632. There are English and Malay Volunteer contingents.

Police.—The force numbers 1,060, all ranks; the rank and file consist of Malays and Sikhs, under Malay and English Officers.

Municipal.—Town Boards are established at Johore Bahru, Muar, Batu Pahat, Segamat, Kota Tinggi and Endau, supervising sanitary work in 23 Town Board Areas and 26 village areas.

Sport.—Subject to the regulations for the protection of wild animals, permission may be obtained to shoot elephant, gaur, rhinoceros, tapir, deer, tiger, panther, crocodile, and pig.

KEDAH.

H.H. Sir Abdul Hamid Halimshah ibni Ahmad Tajudin, K.C.M.G., Sultan; H.H. Tunku Ibrahim, C.M.G., C.V.O., Regent.

Kedah is a State on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula situated between the parallels of 5° 5' and 6° 35' N. lat. and the meridians of 99° 35' and 101° 10' E. long. It is bordered on the interior (north and east) by the States of Singgora and Patani (Siamese) and by the State of Perak (F.M.S.), and extends along the sea coast from the River Sangiang, its boundary with its northern neighbour the State of Perlis (under British protection), to the Muda River, its boundary with Province Wellesley. Thence it extends behind the narrow strip of coast which forms Province Wellesley, down to the northern bank of the Krian River, its boundary with the State of Perak.

Both the island of Penang and the territory of Province Wellesley were originally part of Kedah. Penang was acquired from the "King of Quedah" by Captain Light on behalf of the East India Company by the treaty of 1786, and Province Wellesley was ceded by Kedah to Sir George Leith, on behalf of the Company, by the treaty of 1800, to enable the Company to check the piracies on the coast. A sum of $10,000 is, under the treaty of 1869, paid annually by the Government of the Straits Settlements to the Kedah Government in respect of Penang and Province Wellesley.

The State includes the island of Langkawi and a number of smaller islands to the south. It formerly included the island of Terutau to the north of Langkawi, but this island and a small area in the interior of the State, in the eastern watershed, were ceded to Siam in the treaty of 1909.

The mainland of Kedah is about 106 miles in length and about 65 miles in width at its widest part. Its area is, including the Langkawi groups, about 3,648 square miles. The four highest peaks on the mainland are Gunong Bintang (6,103 feet), Gunong Kangar (6,760 feet), Gunong Jerai (3,978 feet) and Bukit Perak (2,823 feet). Gunong Raia, on Langkawi Island, is 2,950 feet high.

History.

There are no authentic records of the early history of the State, and little is known except that the country was converted to Muhammadanism in the 15th or 16th century, and that, like the other States in the Peninsula, it was, at various times, under the domination of Burmah, Aceh, Malacca, and Siam. Like the other States, too, it depended upon the personality of its ruler. Under a strong raja its boundaries extended to include Setul Perlis, and part of Singgora on the north, and Krian on the south, and under a weaker man, or upon the rising of a stronger raja beyond the borders, its boundaries contracted.

There is no record of the Portuguese, during their occupation of Malacca (A.D. 1511 to 1641), having had any intercourse with Kedah. The Dutch, however, after they had wrested Malacca from the Portuguese, established Opperhoofden (Commandants) in Kedah from 1664 to 1711.

From that date until 1786, when Captain Light acquired Penang from the Sultan for the East India Company, little is known of the history of the State.

In 1821, a Siamese fleet appeared off the mouth of the Kedah River, and, by a sudden descent upon the unexpectant Malays, took possession of the fort, and later of the river. The Sultan, who was in the Merbok district at the time, fled to Province Wellesley, where he was afforded protection by the British Government. He was later afforded an asylum in Malacca.

In 1831, Tunku Kudin, a nephew of the Sultan, made a desperate attempt to recover Kedah from the Siamese. He succeeded in driving out the Siamese, and held the country from April until October, but was later conquered
by a combined force of British and Siamese. In 1838, the Malays made another attempt under Tunku Muhammad Saad, and again succeeded in expelling the Siamese. Again, however, they were worsted by the combination of a Siamese army and a blockade by British gunboats.

In 1841 the Siamese allowed the Sultan to return to Kedah and re-assume the government. The Sultan was, however, only allowed to exercise authority over part of the territory that formerly was subject to him. Setul, Perlis, and Kubang Pasu were given to other rajas independent of him. Setul, under the treaty of 1909, is now part of Siam (Monthon Puket); Perlis is still independent and is now under British protection. Kubang Pasu was some years ago again made part of Kedah.

General Description.

The language line between Siamese and Malay runs through Kedah and Perlis, and in the interior parts of these States the Malays speak Siamese as freely as their own language. There is a large number of Sam-sams—a mixed race of Siamese and Malays—who are Muhammedans. Only a few families of the aborigines (Sakeis) are left in the forest at the source of the Muda River. They numbered 105 all told at the 1911 census.

South Kedah, the area lying south of the mountain known as Kedah Peak (Gunong Jeral), is for the most part populated with Europeans, Chinese and Tamils, planting rubber, coconuts and tapioca. There is also a Malay population planting rice along the banks of the Muda River and in the low lying lands along the coast. Kulim was formerly a tin-mining centre of some importance, but the alluvial deposits are now said to be worked out.

North Kedah is almost entirely populated by Malay cultivators of rice. The soil is generally a heavy fertile clay. A quantity of rice is exported annually to Penang and to the Federated Malay States.

The population of Kedah was 245,986 at the 1911 census. At the 1921 census the population was 338,544, of whom 300 were Europeans, 75 Eurasians, 237,043 Malays, 59,403 Chinese, 33,019 Indians and 8,704 "other races." The estimated population in 1925 was 384,000.

Galena has been found in Langkawi, and indications of coal and oil have been reported; nothing of commercial value has, however, yet been discovered, with the exception of a deposit of marble which may prove to be of value.

Climate.

The climate resembles that of Perak. Meteorological returns kept in ten places record an average shade temperature in the day time rising to over 90 deg. F. and falling to nearly 70 deg. F. at night. The driest months are January to March and the wettest August to October, when half the annual rainfall occurs, averaging from 100 to 130 inches a year. Cholera has sometimes broken out in prolonged droughts, but the provision of a good water supply, which is now completed, should prevent this. The health on rubber and other estates is good.

Communications.

Steamers ply between Penang and Semiling, and Yen (in South Kedah), and Sala, and Alor Star (the capital, six miles up the Kedah River) in North Kedah. There is a bi-weekly steamer communication between Penang and Langkawi Island.

A metalled road connects Alor Star with Province Wellesley, a distance of 45 miles. A metalled road extends to the Perlis boundary (25 miles), and a road which branches off at the 12th mile connects the State with Singgora. Another road is being pushed forward towards the Patani frontier, through Langgar, and now extends to Kuala Nerang at the 23rd mile from Alor Star. A metalled road has been made to Baling and North Perak, and other metalled roads have been completed or are under construction. There are a number of earth roads connecting the tapioca and rubber estates in South Kedah with the towns; 189 miles of canals and 22 miles of irrigation channels are maintained by the Public Works Department.

The Federated Malay States railway administration has extended its railway service through Kedah into Perlis. The line leaves the main line at Bukit Mertajam, in Province Wellesley and is 98 miles in length to the Siamese frontier. Trains have been running regularly since October, 1915. A connection through Perlis, with the Siamese railway system has been completed, establishing railway communication between Bangkok and Singapore.

Telegraphic and telephonic communication extends throughout the State.

Education.

There are English schools in Alor Star and Sungai Patani and a Malay Girls' school in Alor Star. There are 72 Malay schools.

Constitution.

Until the beginning of this century the Siamese Government interfered but little in the government of the country, only requiring the Sultan to refer to Bangkok matters of importance, and applications for land by foreign subjects. In 1906, however, the finances of the country had reached such a state that the Sultan was compelled to negotiate with Siam for a loan in order to avoid bankruptcy. With the loan the Siamese Government sent an adviser to advise the Sultan in the general management of the country, and more particularly in its finances.

On the 23rd July, 1905, the Sultan, by an edict, appointed a State Council to assist him in the administration of the country.

The first President was H.H. the Raja Muda, Tunku Abdul Aziz, who died in 1907. He was succeeded by H.H. Tunku Mahmud. The Adviser and the Chief Judge are ex-officio members, and two members may be nominated.

In 1913, the Sultan's health became such that it was necessary to appoint his eldest son, Tunku Ibrahim, as Regent, pending the restoration of the Sultan's health.

With the transfer of the suzerainty of Kedah from Siam to Great Britain under the treaty of 1909, the adviser appointed by Siam has been replaced by an adviser appointed by Great Britain.

Finance.

The amount of the loan obtained in 1906 from Siam was of $2,600,000 at the rate of 6 per cent. This loan was, with the transfer of the suzerainty of the State from Siam to Great Britain under the treaty of 1909, taken over by the Federated Malay States Government at 4 per cent. The Federated Malay States Government paid the interest, $120,953, due at the time of the transfer, and added it on to the capital, thus making the loan amount to $2,720,953.
The public revenue and expenditure during the last five years were respectively:—

| Year       | Revenue   | Expenditure |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| A.H. 1342 (A.D. 1924) | $5,284,554 | $5,667,979 |
| A.H. 1343 (A.D. 1925) | $5,970,148 | $5,671,697 |
| A.H. 1344 (A.D. 1926) | $9,179,487 | $5,481,218 |
| A.H. 1345 (A.D. 1927) | $8,988,428 | $6,396,507 |
| A.H. 1346 (A.D. 1928) | $7,722,507 | $7,336,338 |

The whole of the loan due to the F.M.S. Government has been paid off. The State is now free from debt.

Trade.

The following were the principal exports from Kedah during the year 1346 (1928):—Padi and rice, rubber; tapioca and sago, forest produce, tin-ore, fish, bricks, cattle, hides and horns, pigs and poultry.

The value of the Kedah trade with Penang during 1346 was as follows:—Exports, $26,608,116; imports, $8,928,338.

The value of Kedah trade with the F.M.S. during 1346, was:—Exports, $1,464,297; imports, $76,391.

Perlis.

H.H. Syed Atwi, C.B.E., Raja.

Perlis is a small State on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula north of Kedah. Its area is 316 square miles.

Until 1821 it was subject to Kedah, but when the Siamese, in 1841, allowed the Sultan of Kedah to re-assume the government, they made Perlis an independent State under Syed Hussein, who was given the title of Raja. The present ruler is the great-great-grandson of Syed Hussein and is the fourth raja.

The country, like Kedah, is a rich alluvial plain, which is devoted to rice cultivation. A little tin is exported from the interior, and some of the limestone hills are rich in guano. The Federated Malay States Railway runs through the State and connects with the Siamese railway.
system at Padang Besar. H.H. the Raja resides at Arau which is on the railway. The main Government Offices are at Kangar, about six miles from Arau. There is a Post and Telegraph Office at Kangar and a telephone system exists between the police stations in the State. There are thirty-four and three quarter miles of metalled roads, and thirty miles of earth roads.

The population is about 44,500, of whom some 40,000 are Malays. The public revenue and expenditure for the last five years were respectively:

| Year       | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| A.H. 1342 A.D. 1924 | 453,452 | 341,155     |
| A.H. 1343 A.D. 1925 | 470,616 | 441,825     |
| A.H. 1344 A.D. 1926 | 594,598 | 565,071     |
| A.H. 1345 A.D. 1927 | 614,665 | 630,768     |
| A.H. 1346 A.D. 1928 | 645,114 | 622,752     |

The State, by loans made in 1905 and 1907, incurred a debt of $443,000 to the Siamese Government. These loans, with the transfer of suzerainty from Siam to Great Britain, were taken over by the Federated Malay States. The total debt of the State is now $50,000. When the loans were contracted the Siamese Government sent an Adviser to advise the Raja in the general management of the country, and more particularly in its finances. With the transfer of the suzerainty of Perlis from Siam to Great Britain under the treaty of 1909, the Adviser appointed by Siam has been replaced by an Adviser appointed by Great Britain.

The Raja is assisted by a State Council in the government of the country, and is himself President of the Council. There are four other members of the Council, one of them being the Adviser.

**KELANTAN.**

H.H. the Sultan Ismail bin Almerhum,

Sultan Mohamed IV., K.C.M.G.

The State of Kelantan is situated on the eastern side of the Malay Peninsula, and lies between latitudes 4° 35' and 6° 15' north, and between longitudes 101° 22' and 102° 37' east. It is bounded on the north by the China Sea; on the east by Trengganu; on the south by Pahang; and on the west by Perak and the Siamese Monthon of Penati. The area of the State is estimated to be 5,713 square miles.

As in the case of Kedah, the Government of Siam claimed rights of suzerainty over Kelantan for many years before any attempt was made to direct the administration of the State. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, at the time when the affairs of Kelantan were involved in much confusion owing to a disputed succession, a Siamese Commissioner was appointed to reside at Kota Bharu, the capital, but in spite of this fact the exact rights of Siam were a subject of constant dispute, until matters were placed on a stable footing at the end of 1902 by an agreement under which the Raja undertook to receive a British Officer in the Siamese service as his Adviser, and to administer the state according to his advice. The Adviser took up his post in July, 1903, and since that date great improvements have been effected in the Government of the State. The transfer to the protection of Great Britain was formally effected on July 15th, 1909.

About a sixth part of the area of Kelantan consists of a fertile plain, extending from ten to twenty-five miles from the shore; the greater part of this plain is under cultivation with padi and coconuts. From this plain the land rises gradually into mountain ranges, which reach their greatest height in the south. Gunong Tahan, on the southern boundary, is 7,186 feet high, and is the highest peak in the Malay Peninsula.

The principal river is the Kelantan, which enters the China Sea about ten miles from the western boundary of the State. The Kelantan River is a fine river some 150 miles long, navigable for launches for 80 miles. The basin of the Kelantan River, with those of its tributaries, comprises the greater part of the State. Of the other rivers, the most important are the Golok and the Semerak. By the Anglo-Siamese treaty of 1909, the Golok forms the boundary between Kelantan and the Siamese territory from its source to Kuala Tabal, where it debouches into the China Sea. The Semerak, like the Golok, is a deep river with a shallow bar at its mouth; it enters the sea near the border of Trengganu.

Kelantan possesses a larger Malay population than any other State in the Peninsula. The total population at the 1921 Census was 309,300, including 127 Europeans, 286,334 Malays, 12,779 Chinese, 3,622 Indians, and 6,396 others.

Kota Bharu, the capital, which lies on the right bank of the Kelantan River, about eight miles from its mouth, has a population of about 10,800 people. It is a clean, well laid-out town with good metalled roads. It contains the Sultan's Palace and the British Residency. It has seven schools attended by some 1,760 scholars. Kota Bharu is connected by telegraph with the Siamese Administration. A telegraph line connecting Kota Bharu with Kuala Krai has been completed. It is also connected by telephone with Tumpat, the port of Kelantan, Pasir Putih, Kuala Krai, Bachok, Plekbang, Chehill and Bangnara. Of the smaller towns the principal are Tumpat (population 2,406), Bachok (population 766), on the coast, Pasir Putih (population 858), and Kuala Krai, the head quarters of the southern district of the State. The trunk road from Kota Bharu to Kuala Krai is open for traffic.

Pasir Putih is connected with Kota Bharu by a road which is practicable in all weathers. The East Coast Railway, which will eventually connect Kelantan with Singapors, has been completed as regards the section between Tumpat and Manek Ural, while communication with Penang is now established with a daily train service each way, Sundays excepted.

The main industries of the State are agricultural. The soil is exceedingly fertile. The chief product is padi, the annual harvest of which amounts to 70,000 tons. Kelantan is one of the few Malay States which export padi and rice.

Coconuts and betelnuts are also extensively grown. The coconut palms are remarkably free from disease. As elsewhere in the Malay Peninsula, Para rubber has been largely planted in recent years; in addition to several small properties owned by Malays, there are twenty large estates owned by Europeans. Most of the estates have reached the tapping stage. There is now a steady output of rubber, the quality of which is of a high standard. Fishing and fish drying provide occupation for a large number of Coast Malays. Cattle breeding is also a large industry, though it has been necessary temporarily to restrict the export in order to maintain sufficient cattle for agricultural purposes. The women throughout the State are expert weavers, and a large number of silk sarongs are annually exported to neighbouring States.

Since the extension of British protection to Kelantan, there have been several applications for land for tin mining.

The tin mining industry is likely to increase when the railway is able to carry supplies to the back country.

The chief exports of Kelantan are copra, rubber, cattle, padi and rice, betelnuts, fish, and silk manufactured goods. The chief imports are cotton goods, provisions, kerosene oil, gambier, sugar, timber, salt, and machinery.

The climate of the State is equable, and may be described as hot, and dry compared with the rest of the Peninsula (except in the monsoon), but both temperature and rainfall vary a little during each half of the year. In the plain the temperature in the shade rarely exceeds 90°F., or goes below 69°F., except in January, when 64°F. is not unknown. The nights are cool; the land breezes in the mornings and the sea breezes in the afternoons keep the air pleasant.

In the interior the range of temperature is slightly higher, the days being hotter and the nights cooler. The rainfall averages 103 inches a year.

The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar, but a coin made from an alloy of tin and lead and called pitis is also current in the bazaar; 480 pittis equal one dollar.

Regular steamer communication is maintained between Singapore and Kelantan.

TRENGGANU.

H.H. Sir Sulaiman Badarul-alam Shah,
K.C.M.G., bin Almerhum Zainalabidin, Sultan.

The State of Trengganu lies on the eastern seaboard of the Malay Peninsula roughly between latitude 4° 30' and 5° 45' North, and longitude 102° 15' and 103° 30' East. The area of the State is estimated to be about 5,500 square miles.

The total population of the State, as recorded by the census taken in April, 1921, is 153,765. This total is made up as follows:

European and kindred races ... 34
Malay races ... ... ... 145,023
Chinese ... ... ... 7,246
Indians ... ... ... 211
Other nationalities ... ... 751

There are some 32 miles of road open to traffic. A trunk road from Kuala Trengganu to the Kelantan boundary is under construction. When completed this road will be 60 miles in length. There are no railways. Communication with the interior is entirely by means of the rivers and good native paths. Telegraphic communication was established between the State, the Federated Malay States, and the Straits Settlements in 1922. There is a telephone exchange at Kuala Trengganu.

The chief town is Kuala Trengganu, situated on both banks of the mouth of the Trengganu river, with a population of 12,453.

Other navigable rivers with considerable settlements at their mouths are the Kemaman, Kretai, Dungun, Paka, Marang, Ibar, Stiu, and Besut.

The public revenue and expenditure in A.H. 1346 (30-6-27 to 18-6-28) were $1,402,150 and $1,542,404 respectively.

Total value of exports from Trengganu in 1927, was $8,244,478, and of imports $6,064,748. The principal exports and imports were:

**IMPORTS.**

- Rice ........................................... 2,198,420
- Cotton stuffs .................................. 457,635
- Tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes ............ 359,394
- Sugar ........................................... 263,074
- Petroleum ...................................... 149,407

The rainfall is heavy and well distributed throughout the year, though excessive during the north-east monsoon from November to February. In 1927 the rainfall recorded at Kuala Kretai was 133.13 inches, and at Kuala Trengganu 191.30 inches. The temperature ranges between 63° and 92° F., the greatest range in 24 hours being 25°. Soil and climate are suitable for the cultivation of Para rubber, coconuts, coffee, and pepper.

During part of the north-east monsoon season the coast is difficult of access, though seldom quite unapproachable. British protection dates only from the 14th July, 1909. The suzerainty of Siam, transferred on that date to Great Britain, was merely a nominal overlordship, of which practically the only token was the triennial despatch of the Bunga Mas to Bangkok. This tribute is not now rendered either to Siam or to Great Britain.

An Agreement between His Britannic Majesty's Government and His Highness Sultan Zainal Abidin was signed in Singapore in 1910.

This agreement of four articles provides that mutual help shall be rendered by the two Governments, and for the rendition of fugitive criminals. It also provides for the appointment of a British Officer to reside in Trengganu to be an Agent with functions similar to those of a Consular Officer. His Majesty's Government undertake to protect the Government and the State of Trengganu and all its Dependencies from attack by foreign enemies, and the Trengganu Government surrenders the management of all political matters with Foreign Governments to His Britannic Majesty's Government. The limitation of mining and agricultural concessions to any person other than natives and subjects of Trengganu is also provided for.

This agreement was amended on May 24th, 1919. Under the amended agreement the Sultan agrees to accept a British Officer, called the British Adviser, whose advice must be asked and acted upon in all matters affecting the general administration of the country and the collection and disbursement of all revenues.

The ruling line of Sultans dates from the seventeenth century, as there is unbroken succession from Sultan Zainal Abidin, through ten intermediary Sultans to the present ruler.

Two loans of $1,000,000 each granted by the Straits Government in 1923 and 1928 have enabled Trengganu to resume large Ruling House Land Concessions and to commence a programme of surveys, road construction, and other development works.

A further loan of $1,500,000 for the continuation of the road programme was approved by the Straits Government in 1928.

The mining and agricultural resources of the State are at present practically untouched.

**BRUNEI.**

H.H. Ahmad Tajudin, Sultan.

Brunei is a State lying between North Borneo and Sarawak, between 114° and 116° E. long., and touching the sea at Brunei Bay, in which lies the island of Labuan. It is 770 nautical miles distant from Singapore.

The Sultanate of Brunei was formerly a great and powerful State, and in the early years of the 16th century the authority of its rulers appears to have extended, not only over the Northern part of the Island of Borneo, but over the Sulu Islands and some part of the Philippines. Its wealth and importance at this period are shown by the description given by Pigafetta of the Sultan's Court, and by the fact that the early European navigators extended the name of the Sultanate to the whole of the island, "Borneo" being a corruption of Brunei. The power of the State appears to have begun to decline about the end of the 16th century, and by the middle of the 19th century it had fallen hopelessly into decay. The cession of the district of Sarawak to Sir James Brooke in 1841 was followed by many similar cessions to Sarawak and to the British North Borneo Company, and the State of Brunei has now been reduced to about 2,500 square miles, containing a population of about 30,000, and consisting of the town and district of Brunei and some outlying districts, of which the most important are Tutong, Belait, and Temburong.

In 1888, an agreement was concluded with the Sultan under which the control of foreign relations was placed in the hands of H.M.'s Government, whilst internal affairs were left to the Sultan, and a further agreement was made at the end of 1906, under the terms of which a British Resident has been appointed to advise and assist in the administration of the State. Until 1915 the Resident combined these duties with those of Resident of Labuan, while an Assistant Resident was stationed in Brunei. In 1915 a separate Resident was appointed for Brunei, and the appointment of Assistant Resident discontinued.

The chief town is Brunei, with a population of about 12,000.

Besides the old Malay town which is built over the water on the Brunei River there is a new township on the mainland which has steadily developed since 1910. There are vernacular schools at Brunei and in some of the out-districts. The climate resembles that of the Federated Malay States. The average annual rainfall at Brunei is a little over 100 inches.
Trade is chiefly in the hands of Chinese, of whom there are about 1,000 in the capital. Native industries include fishing, cloth weaving, brass foundries, and the manufacture of silversmiths' ware. The principal imports are rice, cloth, tobacco, sugar, and petroleum, and the principal exports cutch (mangrove extract), wild and plantation rubber, sago, and dried prawns. The trade, to which an impetus was given by the inauguration of the new system of administration, passes through Labuan.

Concessions and monopolies of all kinds were recklessly granted in the past. Many of these have now lapsed and others have been redeemed.

Several companies are engaged in planting Para rubber, while oil prospecting is being vigorously developed.

A cutch factory, established by a London syndicate, is at work at Brunei. The output of cutch in 1927 was 2,101 tons, valued at $202,840.

The Sultan would derive a considerable income from yearly cession payments made by the State of North Borneo and Sarawak Governments were they not mortgaged until the end of 1928. Under the new arrangements the Sultan and his ministers draw fixed monthly allowances from the revenues of Brunei in addition to the amount recoverable from cession money.

The revenue of the State is derived principally from land and mining rents, from an opium monopoly under Government control, from the collection of customs duties, and from purchased Cession moneys. About half of the original Cession moneys have now been purchased by the Government.

The public debt on the 31st December, 1927, was $419,000.

Communications.

There is regular communication with Labuan by steam launch and so with Singapore by the Straits Steamship Company, which maintains a weekly service.

A Central Wireless Telegraph Station was opened in 1921 at Brunei with a subsidiary station at Labuan which enables telegraphic communication to be maintained with Labuan and thence by cable with Singapore and Europe. There are other Wireless Stations in the Belait and Temburong Districts.

The Currency is the Straits Settlements dollar.

*TANGANYIKA TERRITORY.

Extent and Boundaries.

The Tanganyika Territory consists of that portion of the former Colony of German East Africa which, under Article 23, Part I, of the Treaty of Peace with Germany, the Principal Allied and Associated Powers agreed should be administered under a mandate by His Britannic Majesty. The remaining portions of the Colony, namely the districts of Ruanda and Urundi in the North-West, and the Kionga Area, South of the Rovuma River, were similarly entrusted to the administration of Belgium and of Portugal respectively. The Territory extends from the Umba River on the North to the Rovuma River on the South, the coast line being about 500 miles in length, and includes the adjacent islands. The Northern Boundary runs in a north-westerly direction to Lake Victoria at the intersection of the first parallel of latitude with the eastern shore of the lake (Mohuru Point), and thence along the first parallel of latitude until it strikes the Kagera River about 70 miles west of Lake Victoria. From this point the western boundary follows the Kagera River to approximately latitude 2°25', and thence along the eastern boundary of Urundi to the Mlagarasi River which it follows to Lake Tanganyika. The boundary then follows a line due west until it reaches the centre line of Lake Tanganyika which it follows to Kasanga (formerly Bismarckburg), at the southern end of the lake. Thence it follows the boundary of Rhodesia to the northern end of Lake Nyasa and continues along the centre line of Lake Nyasa to a point due west of the Rovuma River whence the boundary runs east and joins the Rovuma River, whose course it follows to the sea. The total area of Territory is about 374,085 square miles, which includes about 20,000 square miles of water.

The Island of Mafia was transferred in 1922 from Zanzibar to the Territory.

General Description.

Along the coast lies a plain, varying in width from 10 to 40 miles, behind which the country rises gradually to a plateau constituting the greater part of the hinterland. This plateau falls sharply from a general level of 4,000 feet to the level of the lakes (Tanganyika, 2,590 feet, Nyasa, 1,607 feet), which mark the great Rift valley extending northwards to Lake Naivasha.

The seat of government is Dar-es-Salaam (population 35,000) which lies along the northern and north-western shores in an almost land-locked harbour, about 3 miles long. The chief buildings are solid and roomy. The second town in importance is Tanga, 136 miles north of Dar-es-Salaam and 80 miles distant from Mombasa. Other seaports are Pangani, Bagamoyo, Kilwa, Lindi, and Mikindani. The most important inland town is Tabora, which has a population of 26,000, and is situated at the junction of the main caravan routes from the coast of Tanganyika and from Victoria Nyanza to Nyasa. Other inland towns are, in the north, Moshi and Arusha; in the central area, Morogoro, Kilosa, and Dodoma; and in the south, Iringa, Mahenge, and Songea. On the great lakes the chief towns are Mwanza and Bukoba, on Victoria Nyanza; Kigoma, the terminus of the Central Railway, Ujiji, on Tanganyika; and Mwaya, on Nyasa.

* For map see under Kenya.
The highest points in the Territory are in the north-east, where are the extinct volcanoes, Kilima Njaro, which rises to 19,720 feet, and is snow-capped, and Mount Meru (14,960 feet). In the south-west are the Livingstone Mountains, where the highest peak is over 9,000 feet.

Portions of the great lakes of Central Africa are included in the Territory, viz.: the southern portion of Lake Victoria, the eastern shores of the lower part of Lake Tanganyika, and the northern and north-eastern shores of Lake Nyasa. There are four smaller lakes and numerous rivers.

Climate.

Generally speaking the rainfall is low for a tropical country and in some years there are great droughts. There are three types of climate, (1) the Indian or trade wind type, which prevails over the greater part. It has one rainy season, from December to April. The hottest period is in November. (2) The monsoon type, prevailing in the N.E. There are two rainy seasons, the heaviest being from March to May and the lesser in November. The hottest month is February. (3) The equatorial type prevailing in the N.W. It has two warmer and two cooler seasons, the warmer being October and February-March (i.e., when the sun is above the Equator), and the cooler July and November-December. The rainy season is October-May (Nyanza) or November-April (Tanganyika). The average yearly temperature in the coast region is 78° F.

History.

The territory was visited in 1884 by Dr. Karl Peters, who made twelve treaties with native chiefs, and in the following year the German Government established a protectorate. This arrangement was recognised by the British Government in 1886. In 1889 an Arab rising was quelled, and the first German steamer launched on Lake Nyasa. A serious native rising took place in 1905. It is estimated that some 120,000 natives died during the struggle or from its immediate results.

Early in 1916 Lieut.-General J. C. Smuts attacked and defeated the German forces at the foot of Kilima Njaro and occupied Moshi on March 13th of that year. By the end of 1916 all the country north of the Central Railway was effectively occupied by His Majesty's Forces or by Belgian troops, and a provisional civil administration was established in that area on January 1st, 1917. In November, 1917, the Germans were driven across the Rovuma River into Portuguese East Africa, and in March, 1918, the jurisdiction of the Administrator was extended to include the greater part of German East Africa. After the surrender of Major-General von Lettow-Vorbeck, in accordance with the terms of the armistice, the military forces were withdrawn, leaving only a garrison of the King's African Rifles; and a Royal Commission was issued in January, 1919, appointing an Administrator. The Tanganyika Order-in-Council, 1920, which was read and proclaimed in Dar-es-Salaam on September 25th, 1920, constituted the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief. The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council. In March, 1921, the district of Ujiji and portions of the districts of Bukoba and Ufipa, which had formerly been administered by the Belgians, were taken over.

In December, 1920, draft mandates for "German East Africa" were submitted to the Council of the League of Nations in favour of Great Britain and Belgium, and these were approved by the League of Nations in July, 1922. The mandate for the part to be assigned to Great Britain lays down conditions directed against slavery, forced labour (except for essential public works and services), abuses in connection with the arms traffic and the trade in spirits, the recruiting of labour, transfer of native lands (except between natives) without the consent of the authorities, and usury. It is provided that nationals of States members of the League of Nations are to have complete commercial equality. An annual report is to be made to the Council of the League. By an Order in Council dated the 19th of March, 1926, provision was made for the constitution of a Legislative Council consisting of the Governor as President, thirteen official members, and not more than ten unofficial members, which came into operation on the 1st July, 1926.

Population.

The number of Europeans in Tanganyika Territory is approximately 5,300. There are also over 18,000 Indians, 4,000 Arabs and 1,000 Goans. The natives are estimated at 4,319,000, whilst the population of Ruanda and Urundi, administered by Belgium, is about 3,500,000. The majority of the natives are Bantu, but considerable areas in the north are occupied by the Massai and other Hamitic races, and in the south by tribes of Zulu extraction. The most important people are the Swahili, who are hybrids between Arabs or Persians and all sorts of African blood. Their language is more or less spoken as a lingua franca from Aden in the north to Durban in the south, and from the Indian Ocean to the waters of the Nile and the Congo.

Most of the natives are pagans, but there are about 300,000 Muhammedans in the coast area and immediate hinterland.

The territory is divided into 11 Provinces as follows:

| Provinces | Capital | Approx. Native Population, 1926 |
|-----------|---------|-----------------------------|
| Central   | Dodoma  | 506,000                     |

| Totals    |         | 4,319,000                   |

The European and American Missions continue to do much for the natives in medicine and education and in an increasing degree are seeking the assistance and guidance of the Government with the view of bringing the educational activities into line with Government requirements. The Missions reported the existence during 1927, of 2,887 schools with a roll of upward of 137,666 pupils. A number of appointments to the European personnel of the Government Education service have been made and the work continues to increase. There are 91 schools conducted by Government, having a roll of 6,541 and an average attendance of 80%.

Sesal is the principal article of export. Other articles in order of value are coffee, cotton, groundnuts, hides and skins, copra, grain, diamonds, beeswax, sim-sim, ivory, gold, bark for tanning, ghee, mica and copal.

The total area under close forest is approximately 4,240 square miles, of which 94·6 per cent. is in Government Forest Reserves, 4·2 per cent. awaits reservation and 1·3 per cent. is valuable forest in private ownership. The forests are most numerous in the north, on the shores and islands of Lake Victoria Nyanza; in the north-east on Kilimanjaro and Meru Mountains; in the east along the Pare and Usambara ranges and in the Uluguru and Nguru Mountains; and at the coast, in the districts of Rufiji, Kilwa and Lindi. The number of timber producing species is large and includes among many others the following:—Pencil Cedar (Juniperus procera), Podocarpus, Chlorophora excelsa (resembling Burma Teak), Ocotea Umbambarensis, Pterocarpus Bussei, Parinarium Holsti, Pygeum Africanum, Azelia chuanzenensis, Khaya senegalensis and Cassipourea Eikii. In addition, valuable species of hardwoods occur as single trees or in groups widely scattered throughout large areas of dry savannah forest. Mangroves of excellent quality cover large areas of the littoral. Ebony is plentiful near the coast and gum copal and wild rubber exist in considerable quantities. Bamboo and baobab are found and may prove suitable for the manufacture of paper pulp.

There are some 4,706,625 head of cattle and 4,778,540 sheep and goats in the possession of the natives.

The following have been mined for export or local use:—Gold, diamonds, mica, salt, tin, garnet and red ochre. Other minerals known to exist include:—Coal, copper, iron, graphite, asbestos and soda. Extensive areas remain to be prospected. The total mineral production for 1927 was valued at £197,493.

Communications.

The Territory is served by two railways of one metre gauge, (1) the Central Railway from Dar-es-Salaam to Kigoma, on Lake Tanganyika (772½ miles), with a branch line from Tabora to Mwanza (238 miles), on Lake Victoria, which was completed and opened for public traffic on August 15th, 1928; (2) the Tanga Railway from Tanga to Moshi, at the foot of Kilimanjaro (219 miles), with a line from Kahama (20 kilometres east of Moshi) linking up with the Kenya and Uganda Railway at Voi. The Voi-Kahama line is run under the management of the Kenya and Uganda Railway. A branch line of the Tanga Railway has been completed as far as the Sanya River (21 miles), a further extension to Arusha (5¾ miles) is under construction, and it is expected it will be completed during 1929.

Fifty-seven miles of two-foot gauge railway are now working during portions of the year, under hand power, between Mingoyo and Ndanda in the Lindi district.

Light motor traffic is now possible over 8,168 miles of roads during the dry season.

The ports of Lake Victoria are served by the steamers of the Kenya and Uganda Marine; those of Lake Nyasa by the Nyasaland Government steamers, and the Tanganyika Railways steamership "Liemba" and a smaller one "Mwanza," together with a Belgian service, maintains communications on Lake Tanganyika. The British steamer "Liemba" (late German s.s. "Goetzen," 793 tons gross) was put into commission on June 9th, 1927, and maintains a fortnightly service to Mpulungu, in Northern Rhodesia.

Posts and Telegraphs.

The telegraph system comprises 3,371 route miles, with 6,477 miles of wire, and the number of offices, including railway telegraph offices open for public business, is 95. The principal offices are Dar-es-Salaam, Tanga, and Lindi, on the coast, Bukoba and Mwanza on Lake Victoria, Kigoma on Lake Tanganyika, Kilosa, Dodoma and Tabora on the Central Railway Line, Moshi on the Kenya Border and Tukuyu on the Nyasaland Border.

The inland telegraph system forms a link of land line communication between Kenya and Uganda to the north, and Nyasaland, Northern and Southern Rhodesia, and the rest of South Africa, while communication is established with the Belgian Congo through a wireless station at Kigoma.

Dar-es-Salaam is connected by cable with Zanzibar through which is established communication with all parts of the world.

Trunk Telephone communication is provided on some of the important routes by utilising the telegraph wires when required, while between Tanga and Dar-es-Salaam the telegraph is superimposed on a permanent Trunk.

Seventeen Telephone Exchange centres are established, comprising 70¼ route miles with 498 miles of wire, in addition to a number of rural installations comprising 22 route miles with 64 miles of wire.

Letter mails from Great Britain are despatched from London weekly via Marseilles, whence they are conveyed direct by vessels of the Messageries Maritimes and by the P. & O. line via Aden, the average time in transit by the former line being 22 days and by the latter 23. Letter mails to Great Britain are despatched from Dar-es-Salaam by all available steamers.

Parcel mails are despatched weekly by steamers of the P. & O. line from London by the all-sea route to Aden, whence they are conveyed by any steamer proceeding to Mombasa or beyond. The Aden-Mombasa-Dar-es-Salaam service is irregular, and the average time of transit of parcel mails from London to Dar-es-Salaam is 31 days.

Fortnightly mail services are maintained with India and South Africa, and there is a frequent exchange of mails by sea with Kenya Colony and Zanzibar.

Places on the Central Railway line between Dar-es-Salaam and Tabora exchange mails six times weekly, between Tabora and Kigoma four times weekly, on the Tanga Moshi line between Tanga and Korogwe daily and between Korogwe and Moshi twice weekly, and the majority of the outlying districts receive a weekly mail by motor or runner services.
Steamships.

The following are the steamship lines serving the Coast of Tanganyika:

To and from Europe and Cape Ports:—Union Castle Mail Steamship Company, British India Steam Navigation Steamship Company, Clan Ellerman Harrison Joint Service, Messageries Maritimes, Compagnie Africaine de Navigation (Belgian), Deutsche-Ost-Afrika-Linie, Holland East Africa Line, Cia Italiana Transatlantica, Navigation Libera Trestina S.A.

To and from United States of America:—Ellerman and Bucknall Steamship Co., Ltd.

To and from East Coast Ports:—Shell Company, African Wharfage Company, Tanganyika Boating Company, Deutsche-Ost-Afrika-Linie.

Currency and Banking.

The German Government and the German East Africa Company issued local rupees of the Indian standard, and subsidiary coins. But the German rupee was exchanged for two shillings of British East African currency and withdrawn from circulation. Indian rupees (coins and notes) have been demonetised. Shillings and subsidiary coins, and currency notes of the East African Currency Board have been introduced at the rate of twenty shillings to the pound sterling and this is the only currency now recognised.

The banks operating in the Territory are the National Bank of India, the Standard Bank of South Africa, Barclay's Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), and the Banque du Congo Belge.
