CYPRUS.

Situation and Topography.

The Island of Cyprus is situated in the easternmost basin of the Mediterranean Sea, with Asia Minor to the north and Syria to the east, at distances of 60 and 41 miles respectively. It lies between 34° 33' and 35° 41' N. latitude, and between 32° 20' and 34° 35' E. longitude. Famagusta, with a harbour able to accommodate vessels up to 23 ft. draught, is 295 miles from Egypt, while the port of Larnaca on the southern coast is 258 miles from Port Said, and 1,117 miles from Valletta in Malta.

Its area is 3,684 square miles, equal to Kent, Sussex, and Middlesex combined. It is the third largest island in the Mediterranean, being only exceeded in size by Sicily and Sardinia. Its greatest length from west-south-west to east-north-east, between Cape Drepano and Cape St. Andrea, is about 140 miles, and its greatest breadth from north to south is about 60 miles.

The main topographical features of the island are the northern and southern mountain chains, and the great plain of the Messoria extending between them across the island from the Bay of Morphou to that of Famagusta. The northern range, called the Carpas Mountains, and, towards their western extremity, the Kyrenia Mountains, forms a continuous chain near the northern shore from Cape St. Andrea to Cape Kormakiti, a distance of about 100 miles. The southern range, which is the more extensive and lofty of the two, occupies the western and south-western portions of the island, and trending thence eastwards along the south coast, terminates in the isolated peak called Santa Croce (or Stavrovouni), about 12 miles west of Larnaca. The highest summit of this range is Mount Trodos, 6,406 feet above the sea level, and on its south-eastern slopes are the summer quarters of the garrison, of the Governor, and some of the principal officials.

The rivers of Cyprus are nearly all mountain torrents, dry in summer. None are navigable. The principal are the Pedias and the Idalia.

History and Archaeology.

The history of Cyprus is too long and eventful to be related here except in the briefest outline. Excavations have shown that in the second millennium B.C. the island must have been an important centre of Aegean civilization, having intercourse both with Assyria and with Egypt, and at a very early date important Greek and Phoenician colonies were established in it. In the 6th century B.C. it passed under the rule of Egypt, but in 526 B.C. it joined Cambyses in his war against the Egyptians and so was absorbed in the Persian Empire. The whole island, with the exception of the Phoenician town of Amathos, took part in the Ionic revolt in 502 B.C., but the Persians recovered possession in about a year and at the battle of Salamis the fleet of Xerxes included 150 Cypriote ships. At the end of the 5th century the famous Evagoras of Salamis established his supremacy over the whole island and raised it for a brief period to a position of practical independence, but after his death it again came under the control of Persia. After the battle of the Issus, Cyprus hastened to join Alexander the Great and sent 120 ships to assist him in the siege of Tyre. At the division of Alexander's Empire, the possession of Cyprus was disputed by Syria and Egypt, but it eventually passed to the latter. In 68 B.C. it became a Roman province and was for a time joined to Cilicia, during which period it was administered by Cicero. Presented by Antonius to Cleopatra, it reverted to Rome on her death, and remained a Roman province until the division of the Empire, when it was assigned to the Eastern Emperor. Its proximity to Syria exposed it to the assaults of the Saracens, and it changed hands more than once between the 7th and 10th centuries A.D. It was finally recovered for Byzantium by Nicephorus Phocas in 965, and remained attached to the Eastern Empire until 1184. In that year its Governor, Isaac Comnenus, revolted and declared himself Emperor of Cyprus. Isaac maintained his independence until 1191, when Cyprus was conquered by Richard I. of England, in revenge for the ill-treatment of the crews of some English ships which had been wrecked on the island. Richard sold the island first to the Order of the Temple and later, when the Templars found the task of government beyond their powers, to Guy de Lusignan, King of Jerusalem. Cyprus was ruled by the Lusignan dynasty from 1192 until 1489, but during that period the Genoese Republic exercised a suzerainty over part of the kingdom, from 1373 until 1464, by holding possessions of the principal port of Famagusta. From 1489 until 1571 Cyprus belonged to the Republic of Venice. In the latter year the Turks conquered the island, and retained possession of it until its cession to England, in 1878, for administrative purposes. On the outbreak of war with Turkey in 1914 the island was annexed to the British Crown by Order in Council of the 5th of November, 1914. By Article 20 of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey signed at Lausanne on 24th July, 1923, Turkey recognised the annexation.

On the 1st of May, 1925, by Letters Patent passed under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom, the island was formally elevated to the status of a Colony and the High Commissioner assumed the title of Governor.

Historical Monuments and Museums.

Bronze Age, Phoenician, Hellenic, and Roman antiquities have been found in immense quantities all over Cyprus from time immemorial, and scientific explorations on a large scale were conducted during the latter part of the last century, and even still an occasional treasure trove of importance may be found. But it is more the ambition of the present administration of antiquities to place the numerous classic sites and monuments in a condition rendering them accessible and of greater interest to the visitor than has hitherto been attempted. Paphos, Salamis, Idalion, and many other places demand attention in order to preserve their ancient character, now threatened by the island becoming once more a centre of revived life and activity. Salamis possesses the remains of probably the largest entrepot (Forum) ever built by the Romans, foreshadowing perhaps the famous "Emporium of the East" as Famagusta was called in the middle ages. A Roman temple of the largest size at Nea-Paphos lies in ruins which have never been explored (vide Hogarth's "Devia Cypria," 1889).

The Museum (architect, G. Jeffery, O.B.E., F.S.A., Cur. Anc. Monts.), Nicosia, built as a memorial to Queen Victoria and much added to in recent years, contains a very magnificent collection of Cypriot pottery, stone carving, gold and metal works of art. Separate smaller collections of the medieval architectural fragments, which a realways coming to light, have been formed as Musées Lapidaire in the principal towns.

The superb Gothic cathedrals and churches of Nicosia and Famagusta, in their curious Eastern surroundings, attract numerous visitors. These buildings, of the finest type of French medieval art, are singularly well preserved where they have been converted into mosques; in other cases they are interesting ruins.
The Venetian and Genoese Republics left few traces of their rule in the island beyond the imposing fortifications of the seaports of Famagusta, Kyrenia and Limassol, all of which are scheduled as Ancient Monuments.

The number of Ancient Monuments in Cyprus now protected by the Antiquities Law of 1905 amounts to 64.

**Climate.**

The mean temperature, as recorded in the screen at Nicosia, for the last fifteen years is 66°0° Fahr.; mean maximum, 77°7; mean minimum, 54°4°. Highest shade temperature during that time 110°; lowest 26°. Average rainfall for last ten years, 20'33 inches. The year 1927 had a rainfall of 16'81 inches. Figures for rainfall refer to the whole Island. The rainy and cool season is from October to March. The climate is varied, hot and dry in the plains in summer, and damp on the sea-shore; the climate on the hills inland is bracing and healthy. In winter the temperature rarely falls below freezing point. Malarial fevers are prevalent during the hot months, and, if the winter is mild, they occur throughout the year. Sanitary improvements and plantations of trees have, however, had a beneficial effect.

**Population.**

The population of the several districts, excluding the military, at the census taken in 1901, 1911, and 1921, was:

| District   | 1901 | 1911 | 1921 |
|------------|------|------|------|
| Nicosia    | 71,289 | 81,497 | 93,765 |
| Famagusta  | 48,508 | 58,530 | 63,755 |
| Larnaca    | 26,073 | 29,737 | 34,918 |
| Limassol   | 39,139 | 46,084 | 54,332 |
| Paphos     | 35,205 | 38,508 | 42,330 |
| Kyrenia    | 16,808 | 19,752 | 21,615 |
| **Total**  | **237,022** | **274,108** | **310,715** |

The Moslems, who are all Ottoman Turks, form about 19'74 per cent. of the population, the rest being nearly all Christians of the Independent Cypriote Church.

The Cypriote Church is a branch of and in communion with the Orthodox Eastern Church, but is "autocephalous" (i.e., the Archbishop of Cyprus is not subordinate to any Patriarch). This position of independence it has retained undisputed since the 5th century when the Emperor Zeno finally decided against the claims of the Patriarch of Antioch to exercise authority over it.

Christianity was originally introduced into the island by St. Paul and St. Barnabas, the latter of whom, a Cypriote Jew by birth, was martyred at Salamis.

**Towns.**

The chief towns are Nicosia, the capital, 18,579 inhabitants; Larnaca, 9,765; Limassol, 13,302. The two latter are open roadsteads. At Famagusta, on the east, it has often been proposed to construct a great commercial and naval harbour. The inner harbour is dredged over an area of 900 feet by 600 feet, to 24 feet at low water (ordinary spring tides), with a channel of approach 250 feet wide and 26 feet deep. The curtain wall, south of Othello's Tower, has been pierced with three arches, giving access from the town to the new quay. The quay is faced with a concrete wall 900 feet long in 24 feet of water. Further accommodation for sailing vessels and local craft has been provided in a basin 450 feet long, 200 feet wide, and 15 feet deep at low water. At present the town is little more than a collection of ruins encircled by fortifications, and it has 1,887 inhabitants, nearly all Moslems, but it is now being rebuilt and opened out. Varosha, a suburb of Famagusta, has a population of 5,093, nearly all Christians. The four towns already mentioned are the capitals of four of the six administrative provinces into which the island is divided—the other two capitals being Kteima, 4,117, the modern capital of Paphos, on the southwest, and Kyrenia, 1,910, where a small harbour has been constructed, in the district of the same name on the north coast, which has some trade with the opposite coast of Karamania. A harbour for small coasting vessels exists at Paphos, the site of the ancient capital of that district. This had become silted up and almost useless, but it has recently been dredged sufficiently to enable small sailing vessels to enter and lie in safety.

**Industry.**

Cyprus was in ancient times famous for its copper mines, and an American syndicate is now operating on a considerable scale in the Evrychou Valley with a crushing plant at Morphou Bay, where steamers call and load the ore. Gypsum is exported in the form of plaster-of-paris from Larnaca and Limassol, where machinery has been set up for grinding it; from these ports it is sent monthly to Egypt, smaller quantities going to Turkey and Syria. Asbestos is found on Mount Troodos, and it is mined by the Cyprus Asbestos Company, Limited, and a local syndicate. The Company has recently established an asbestos brick and tile making plant, and a subsidiary Company a large steam bakery both at Amiandos. Terra Umbra is burnt in large quantities in Larnaca and exported to Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States of America, in both a raw and burnt condition. Chrome is being mined by two companies. A modern tannery has been built at Larnaca, which now supplies most of the leather required for the Island. It imports buffalo and other hides to augment the local supplies. It is an up-to-date establishment, and is now working up an important export trade in tanned skins, especially for the glove trade. A factory for the preparation of sumach has also been established at Limassol. The development of the silk industry has received great assistance by the establishment of a Silk Filature at Yeroskipos, in Paphos. The latest factory to be established is one for the preparation of concentrated citric juices for export by Kia-Ora Limited.

The main industry of the island is agriculture, the products chiefly consisting of cereals, carobua, wine, spirits and vinegar, tobacco and cigarettes, linseed, flax, aniseed, cumin seed, sumach, silk, silk cocoons, wool, straw, hides and skins, cotton, cotton seed, cheese, potatoes, onions, raisins, grapes, oranges, lemons, mandarines, pomegranates, peaches, apricots, cherries, plums, almonds, and hazel nuts; cattle, mules, donkeys, sheep, poultry and eggs are also exported.

Agriculture is dependent largely on irrigation, the water for which is obtained mainly from wells in the dry season and by flooding from streams during the rainy season. There are two streams which have their source in hill ranges which are tapped by drives into the hills, one at Lapithos and the other at Kythrea. Agriculture has been greatly retarded by the deficient rainfall and the
lack of water for irrigation. Boring trials have, however, revealed the presence of artesian water and irrigation schemes are now contemplated, which it is hoped will contribute to the development of agriculture generally and to fruit production in particular.

Considerable attention has been given in the last year or two to tobacco, and the Government has provided itinerant Tobacco Experts to afford instruction to the peasant growers. These efforts are bearing results, and this year's crop is a considerable improvement on that of previous years. Special efforts are also being made in London to facilitate the marketing of tobacco and cigarettes in the United Kingdom. Similar efforts are being made in regard to flax, the cultivation of which is extending.

Cyprus wine, which has been famous from early times, has lately received a good deal of attention. It was formerly a domestic industry, and the wines produced consequently lacked uniformity in character and quality. Modern methods of manufacture have now been introduced and good light table wines are now on the market. An effort is also being made to market Cyprus wines in the United Kingdom, and a Law has been enacted to prohibit the export to British Possessions of wines not coming up to the standards required. This, it is hoped, will secure recognition of the good wines produced in Cyprus and prevent the export of inferior wines, prejudicial to the marketing of the best Cyprus wines.

The improvement of agriculture is fostered by the Government by means of Nursery Gardens in suitable centres for the distribution of seeds and plants, by experimental and demonstration plots in village centres or along roadsides, by School Gardens, by itinerant agricultural experts, agricultural shows, etc. The Department of Agriculture has been recently reorganised, and it is hoped in the near future to establish a Central Experiment Farm, a Citrus Experiment Station, and an Experimental Vineyard.

The Agricultural Department has an Agricultural College where courses of agricultural instruction are given to the students, pupils of the Nicosia Training School, schoolmasters, etc. The building of an up-to-date college on the Central Experiment Farm above referred to is contemplated. Young Cypriots are sent from time to time to England for special training as agriculturists, entomologists, etc.

Considerable attention is given by the Government to cattle breeding. Cyprus is famous for its donkeys and mules. The Government maintains a stock farm at Athalassa and stud stables throughout the Island. Good breeds of cattle, horses, sheep and goats are imported for the improvement of the local breeds. Good breeds of poultry are maintained by the Government for distribution. The export of poultry and eggs is increasing yearly, and there is considerable room for expansion.

The establishment of a weekly mail service with Egypt has led to an increased production of crops, particularly fruit and vegetables. Egypt is in fact the principal market for Cyprus produce; over a quarter of its exports go to Egypt, including a considerable export of oxen, sheep and mules.

In past years much injury has been done to the crops by locusts, but the work of locust destruction was vigorously prosecuted for many years with great success, chiefly on what is known as the "screen and pit" system. Screens topped with American cloth, over which the locusts cannot pass, were stretched across the country in front of the armies of young locusts on the march. The locusts were then gradually forced into pits dug at intervals transversely to the screens, from which, as they are topped with a zinc lining, they could not emerge. This system, as the locusts became more scattered, was discarded in favour of a system of collecting locust eggs and purchasing live locusts. Both the purchase and the spraying systems have been employed in recent years.

The forests of the island, which had been largely destroyed in the past, are recovering under the protection now afforded. Natural re-afforestation is very slow, partly in consequence of the depredations of goats, of which Cyprus, in proportion to its area, contains a large number, and partly in consequence of the forest fires that occur through the summer months.

Sponge fishing has been extensively carried on along the coast by boats from the Greek islands. By a law passed in 1890 power was given to the High Commissioner to grant exclusive privileges for fishing the coasts for sponges.

Sea fishing is comparatively neglected, and it is difficult to obtain fish all the year round except at the seaport towns.

The chief imports are cotton and woollen goods, tobacco, groceries, rice, leather, petroleum, timber, sugar, soap, copper and iron; the exports are chiefly cereals, cotton, carobs, silk cocoons linseed, aniseed, raisins, fruit and vegetables, cheese, sumac, wool, wines and spirits, vinegar, flax, sesame, asbestos, gypsum, iron pyrites, chrome and terra umbra.

Currency and Banking.

Under an Order in Council, which came into operation on the 1st January, 1901, the following coins are legal tender currency:—Gold, the sovereign. Silver, 18, 9, 4½, 3 piastre pieces. Limit of tender 540 piastres (nine equal to one shilling). Bronze, 1 piastre, half piastre, quarter piastre, limit of tender, 27 piastres (40 paras=1 piastre). By proclamation of 28th April, 1928, a new silver 45-piastre piece is current and legal tender in the colony as from that date. Currency Notes were issued from time to time from September, 1914, as a war measure. By an Order-in-Council of 1st November, 1928 the Treasurer as "Commissioner" of Currency was authorised to issue Currency Notes of the Government; such Notes are to be legal tender, and provision was made for the conversion of the Notes into sterling and vice versa, and for the establishment of a Note Security Fund.

The Ottoman Bank has a branch established at Nicosia, and agencies at Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta and Paphos.

The Bank of Athens has a branch established at Limassol and agencies at Nicosia, Larnaca, Famagusta and Paphos.

The Ionian Bank has a branch established at Nicosia.

There is a Bank of Cyprus, with headquarters in Nicosia.

A Government savings bank was opened in 1903.

The Agricultural Bank of Cyprus, Limited, which operates under a Government Guarantee, was established in 1925, with head offices at Nicosia. It lends money to farmers through the medium of Co-operative Credit Societies or direct to individuals.
The Turkish weights and measures are in use. The oké=2·8lbs. avoirdupois; and the donum=about ½ acre. A law relating to weights and measures was passed in 1890.

Means of Communication.

The Government Railway from Famagusta Harbour to Nicosia (37 miles) came into use in August, 1906, was extended to Morphou (24 miles), in 1907, and to Erychou, in the direction of Troodos (15 miles), in 1915.

There is no navigable waterway in the island. Roads between all important places are maintained, and many villages are now connected with them by cart roads. There are motor car services between Nicosia, Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta, Paphos, and Kyrenia, the chief towns of each district. The Famagusta harbour was completed in June, 1906. An extension of the pier at Larnaca, with a solid sheltering arm at the sea end, giving protection to small boats and lighters in all weathers, was completed in 1909. The ancient harbour at Paphos has recently been dredged to a sufficient depth to admit of its use by the small coasting craft that trade between Egypt, Syria, Asia Minor and Cyprus, and the area available for such craft increased in the Kyrenia Harbour. Proposals for the improvement of the harbours at Larnaca, Famagusta and Kyrenia are under consideration. There are no Government telegraphs, other than those along the railway, but the Eastern Telegraph Company, Limited, maintain a cable from Egypt to Cyprus and land lines connecting the six principal towns of the Island and the Troodos Government Quarters. A weekly Mail Service is maintained between Egypt, Cyprus, Syria and Cilicia by subsidized steamers of the Khedivial SS. Co. Steamers of the Lloyd Triestino Company, of Trieste, call fortnightly from Egypt via Palestine, Syria and Mersina en route for Greece and Italy, and another line of the same Company fortnightly from Italy and Greece en route for Mersina, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Greece and Italy. Steamers of the Messageries Maritimes call fortnightly from France via Italy, Greece and Turkey en route for Syria, Palestine, Egypt and France. Steamers of the Sitmar Line call fortnightly from Italy via Egypt, Palestine and Syria en route for Turkey, Greece, Italy and France.

The Parcels Post is established between Cyprus and the United Kingdom and the principal colonies and foreign countries, as well as within the colony. Money Orders and British Postal Orders are also issued and paid in the colony. “Cash on Delivery” parcels for delivery within the colony are accepted and delivered at the principal post offices. A reciprocal service of “Cash on Delivery” of parcels has been established between Cyprus and the United Kingdom, Egypt and the Sudan.

Education.

A general system of grants in aid of elementary schools was established in 1882, and was further regulated by Laws passed in 1923 which are now in force.

There is a Board of Education for each religious community in the Island, i.e. the Greek Christian, the largest, the Moslem, next in size, and Armenian, Latin, Maronite and Jews which are quite small. All schools are supported by local taxation which is kept separate for each community, and by grants from the Government.

The following are the schools and enrolments of each community according to the latest statistics:

Greek Christian.—626 schools, 22,856 boys, 13,528 girls, annual expenditure 75,282l.

Moslem.—268 schools, 5,437 boys, 3,641 girls, annual expenditure 19,012l.

Other communities.—14 schools, 1,215 scholars, annual expenditure 2,387l.

Secondary Schools.

There is a Moslem “Idæî” school in Nicosia which is supported entirely by the Government and the Evqaf as an inheritance from the previous Administration.

A Greek-Christian gymnasium in Nicosia, Limassol, Paphos, and Varosha, and a commercial lyceum at Larnaca, and a high school at Kyrenia, are managed by elective committees under the Secondary Education Law, 1923, but are supported mainly by entrance fees, without State aid. There is also a Seminary school at Larnaca, under the control of the Holy Synod of Cyprus, of which the Archbishop is President, with an enrolment of 109 pupils.

The “English School,” conducted by English masters on the lines of an English grammar school, prepares boys who are going to England for their education and also for commerce. It has 189 pupils, chiefy sons of Government officials of all nationalities, and is supported by school fees. The American Academy at Larnaca is supported by the Reformed Presbyterian Mission, with an enrolment of 179 pupils.

There is also an American Academy for girls at Nicosia with 54 pupils and a Private Girls’ School at Limassol with 114 pupils, supported chiefly by school fees.

British Occupation.

On the 4th June, 1878, a Convention was signed at Constantinople between the representatives of Her Britannic Majesty and the Sultan of Turkey, by which England engaged to join the Sultan in defending his Asiatic possessions against Russia in certain contingencies, and the Sultan, “in order to enable England to make necessary provision for executing her engagements,” consented “to assign the Island of Cyprus, to be occupied and administered by England.” On the 1st of July an
Annex to this Convention was signed at Constantinople, in explanation of the conditions of the occupation. The following is the English official version of its provisions:—

"I. That a Mussulman religious Tribunal (Makhémé-i-Shéríeh) shall continue to exist in the island, which will take exclusive cognisance of religious matters, and of no others, concerning the Mussulman population of the island.

"II. That a Mussulman resident in the island shall be named by the Board of Pious Foundations in Turkey (Evqaf) to superintend, in conjunction with a Delegate to be appointed by the British Authorities, the administration of the property, funds, and lands belonging to mosques, cemeteries, Mussulman schools, and other religious establishments existing in Cyprus.

"III. That England will pay to the Porte whatever is the present excess of revenue over expenditure in the island; this excess to be calculated upon and determined by the average of the last five years, stated to be 22,936 purses, to be duly verified hereafter, and to the exclusion of the produce of State and Crown lands* let or sold during that period.

"IV. That the Sublime Porte may freely sell and lease lands and other property in Cyprus belonging to the Ottoman Crown and State (Arazi Mirié vé Emlaki Houmeyoun), the produce of which does not form part of the revenue of the island referred to in Article III.

"V. That the English Government, through their competent authorities, may purchase compulsorily, at a fair price, land required for public improvements, or for other public purposes, and land which is not cultivated.

"VI. That if Russia restores to Turkey Kars and the other conquests made by her in Armenia during the last war, the Island of Cyprus will be evacuated by England, and the Convention of the 4th of June, 1878, will be at an end."

On the 14th of August, 1878, a supplementary agreement was signed, giving to Her Britannic Majesty for the term of the occupation full powers for making laws and conventions for the government of the island in Her Majesty's name, and for the regulation of its commercial and consular relations and affairs, free from the Porte's control.

The Order in Council of the 5th of November, 1914, annexing the island contains the following provisions:—

"1. From and after the date hereof the said Island shall be annexed to and form part of His Majesty's Dominions and the said Island is annexed accordingly.

"2. Nothing in this Order shall affect the validity of any Instructions issued by His Majesty under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet to the High Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief of Cyprus, or of any Order in Council affecting Cyprus, or of any Law or Proclamation passed or issued under any such Instructions or Order, or of any act or thing done under any such Instructions, Order, Law or Proclamation, save in so far as any provision of any such Order in Council, Law or Proclamation may be repugnant to the provisions of any Act of Parliament which may, by reason of the annexation hereby declared, become extended to Cyprus, or to any Order or Regulation made under the authority of any such Act or having in Cyprus the force and effect of any such Act."

Government.

Letters Patent, bearing date 10th March, 1925, are the instrument now regulating the government of the Colony. The Government is administered by a Governor aided by an Executive and a Legislative Council. The Legislature consists of the Governor, who is usually to preside, nine official Members and fifteen elected Members, three chosen by the Mohammedan and twelve by the non-Mohammedan voters. Only British subjects over 25 years of age are eligible for election. Every male person, being a British subject, or having resided in the Colony not less than five years, who has attained the age of 21 years and has paid any class of the taxes called Verghi, may exercise the franchise. The Council may be prorogued or dissolved by the Governor whenever he thinks fit, and must be dissolved at the end of five years. The island, for administrative purposes, is divided into six districts namely—Nicosia, Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta, Kyrenia, and Paphos. In each the Government is represented by a Commissioner.

For judicial purposes it is divided into three judicial districts, namely the administrative districts of (1) Nicosia and Kyrenia, of (2) Famagusta and Larnaca, and of (3) Limassol and Paphos.

The Courts established by the Cyprus Courts of Justice Order, 1882 (as amended) and superseding those in existence at the time of the occupation, were reconstituted by an Order in Council which came into force on 1st October, 1927, and provides for:—

(1) A Supreme Court, consisting of five judges, two of whom are Christian and Moslem Cypriots respectively, and having power to hear criminal and civil appeals from the decisions of all other courts, including divisional courts of the Supreme Court.

(2) Three Divisional Courts consisting of one or two judges of the Supreme Court, as may be directed by the Chief Justice, and exercising the original jurisdiction conferred upon the Supreme Court to hear and determine (a) defended actions over £300 and (b) election petitions.

(3) Three District Courts, the personnel of each consisting of a President and four Cypriot Judges, two Christians and two Moslems, but when functioning constituted by the President and one or two Judges of differing religions, and having appellate civil jurisdiction in appeals from Assistant District Judges and original civil jurisdiction in all actions except those within the exclusive jurisdiction of a Mussulman Religious Tribunal or triable by a Divisional Court, as stated in 2(a) supra. In bankruptcy, petitions for winding up companies, probate and in actions in respect of injury to property their jurisdiction is unlimited.

(4) Assistant District Judges' Courts of which there are at present nine. The Courts are held by an Assistant District Judge, and the President and the District Judges have also jurisdiction. These Courts have civil jurisdiction up to 25l. and, exceptionally, up to 50l.

(5) Three Assize Courts having unlimited criminal jurisdiction and consisting of three or

* The exercise of these rights by the Porte was agreed to be abandoned, from the 1st of April, 1879, for a payment of 5,000l. a year. (Agreement of the 3rd February 1879.)
five judges, as may be directed by the Chief Justice, these being in the former case a non-Cypriot Judge of the Supreme Court and either two Judges or the President and one Judge of the District Court, and in the latter two non-Cypriot Judges of the Supreme Court and the President and two Judges of the District Court.

(6) (I) Magisterial Courts, consisting of the President and one or two District Judges of differing religions, having summary jurisdiction in cases involving up to three years' imprisonment or 100l. fine or both, and with or without an order for compensation not exceeding 100l.

(II) Magisterial Courts, consisting of the President sitting alone or of two District Judges of differing religions sitting together, having summary jurisdiction up to twelve months' imprisonment or 50l. fine or both, and with or without an order for compensation not exceeding 50l.

The above statements apply to jurisdiction over both Cypriots and non-Cypriots, the distinction created by the Order in Council of 1882 having been abolished by that of 1927.

There is a police force of 914 men, when at full strength, mostly Moslems, including the rank and file detailed for duty as prison warders.

Finances.

The principal sources of revenue in Cyprus are:

1. Verghi Kimat, a tax of 4 per 1,000 on the capital value of lands, houses, and other immovable property.

The above rate of 4 per 1,000 has been modified to the extent of the valuation in any town or village so as to yield, as nearly as may be (provided that any fraction of 10 paras in such rate shall be counted as 10 paras) a sum equivalent to the amount of the assessment prior to the coming into operation of the Valuation Law 13 of 1913, Section 5.

2. Sheep, goat, and pig tax.

3. An excise on tobacco and spirits.

4. Stamps, court fees, royalties, licences, &c., &c.

5. Salt monopoly.

6. Import duties.

All exemptions formerly enjoyed by foreigners have been abolished.

Grants in aid have been received from the British Government annually since 1897. From 1911-12 the grant was fixed at 50,000l. a year, and since 1928, it has been increased to the fixed rate of 92,800l. a year. A contribution of 10,000l. a year has from the latter date, been made by the Colony towards the cost of Imperial Defence.
