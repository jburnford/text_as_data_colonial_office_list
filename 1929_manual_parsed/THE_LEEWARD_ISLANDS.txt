*THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Leeward Islands, so called in contrast to
the Windward Islands, which are most exposed to
the N.E. Trade, the prevailing wind in the West
Indies, form the most northerly group of the
Lesser Antilles, the whole of which were included
among the Windward Islands as the term was
used by the Spaniards. Some of them belong
to Holland (St. Eustatius, Saba, a part of St.
Martin), France (Guadeloupe, Martinique, St.
Bartholomew, and part of St. Martin) and the
United States of America (Bleiques and Culebra
and St. Thomas, St. Croix and St. John, which
were formerly Danish and form part of the
Virgin Islands). The English Leeward Islands
comprising the Presidencies of Antigua (with its
dependencies, Barbuda and Redonda), Montserrat,
St. Kitts and Nevis (including Anguilla),
Dominica, and the Virgin Islands, were constituted
a single Federal Colony by an Act passed in the
Imperial Parliament in the Session of 1871,
34 & 35 Vict., cap. 107. The total area of the
Colony is 704 square miles, about the size of the
county of Surrey, and its population according to
the 1921 census, 122,242.

The island of Sombrero was added to the colony
by Order in Council under the Colonial Boundaries
Act, on August 10th, 1904.

History.

The islands were discovered by Columbus on
his second voyage, in 1493, and became British
during the 17th century. Particulars of their
subsequent history will be found in the separate
articles, but it may here be mentioned, that with
the exception of Dominica, they have been from
the first associated politically as well as geographi-
cally. They were all colonised from St. Kitts
as centre, all included in the Carlisle grant, and
possessed a common Legislature as far back as
the reign of William and Mary. The General
Legislature met for the last time in 1798,
when it passed a highly humane slave ameliora-
tion Act, which was allowed; a Catholic Emancipa-
tion Act, and an Act repealing the duty on exports
of 4½ per cent. for the benefit of the English ex-
chequer—both which were disallowed. An attempt
was made by Sir William Colebrook in 1837 to revive
the General Legislature, and though the attempt
was regarded unfavourably in some quarters,
and the Legislature never actually met, yet the
right to revive it was clear, and there is no doubt
that the Act of 1871, the passing of which was
largely due to the energy and activity of Sir
Benjamin Pine, is no more than a revival of
the ancient constitution of the islands. The
Presidencies of St. Kitts and Nevis, with Anguilla
and their respective dependencies, were united
into one Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2
of 1882.

Climate.

The climate of the islands varies, but is usually
dry and fairly healthy. Antigua is subject to
drought, and has an average rainfall of about
45 inches; St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat have
average rainfalls of from 50 to 60 inches; the
rainfall of Dominica averages about 120 inches.

* For general map of the West Indies, see under
Windward Islands.
The mean temperature is about 80°, with but a slight range. The Virgin Islands are cooler. The hot season is from May to October; the rainy season from August to December.

**Constitution.**

By "The Leeward Islands Act, 1871," one Executive and one Legislative Council, under one Governor, were constituted for the six (now five) presidencies. The Legislative Council now consists of ten official and ten elected members. Three elected members are chosen by the unofficial members of the Legislative Council of Antigua, two by those of the Legislative Council of Dominica, three by those of the Legislative Council of St. Kitts and Nevis, and one by those of the Legislative Council of Montserrat. They must be and continue members of their respective island councils. As there is no Legislative Council in the Virgin Islands, one member is appointed by the Governor to represent that Presidency under "The Leeward Islands Act, 1871, Amendment Act, 1924." The official members are the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Federal Treasurer, the Administrators of St. Kitts-Nevis, and Dominica, and the Commissioners of Montserrat and the Virgin Islands, and such other person holding office under the Government of the Colony of the Leeward Islands as the Governor with the approval of the Secretary of State may appoint. (Vide L. I. Act, No. 6 of 1923.)

The Legislative Council has concurrent legislative powers with the local legislatures on certain subjects specified in the Act, such as matters of property, mercantile and criminal law, the law relating to status, the maintenance of a general police force and a common convict establishment, quarantine, postal and telegraph affairs, currency, audit, weights and measures, education and the care of lunatics, all matters relating to immigration, copyright and patents, and its own constitution and procedure. Any island legislature is, in addition, competent to declare other matters to be within the competency of the general legislature. Any island enactment on such subjects is void if repugnant to an enactment of the general legislature, or may at any time be repealed or altered by one.

The Council meets at least once a year, at a place notified by proclamation, and no Council lasts more than three years. The session usually lasts for about one week.

The expenses of the federal establishments are voted by the Council, and apportioned among the Presidencies.

The Council has power to alter its constitution by an ordinary Act, to be reserved for the King's pleasure, and the King has power, by Order in Council, at any time to include any other West Indian Island in the federation, upon joint addresses from the Legislative Body of such island, and from the Council, on such terms and conditions in each case as are in the addresses expressed. This power has not actually been exercised, and the inclusion in the Colony of Sombrero, which had no legislative body, was effected as above mentioned under a different Act.

**Currency and Banking.**

The usual currency is British silver, a few British and United States gold coins being occasionally met with. Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas) Ltd. and the Royal Bank of Canada have branches in Antigua, St. Kitts, and Dominica, and the latter bank has a branch in Montserrat. In Nevis and the Virgin Islands there are no banks.

Government savings banks have been established in all the Presidencies.

**Means of Communication.**

The following Steamship Lines serve the Colony:

- Canadian National Steamships from Canada and Bermuda call at the chief ports in the Colony proceeding to Windward Islands, Barbados, Trinidad and British Guiana. Passenger ships call every four weeks, and cargo ships call fortnightly.
- Furness-Bermuda Line (Br.) and Ocean Dominion Line (U.S.) once every four weeks from New York and St. Thomas call at St. Kitts, Antigua and Dominica, proceeding to French West Indies, Windward Is., Barbados, Trinidad, etc.
- A cargo steamer from London (Harrison Line) proceeds direct to Antigua and St. Kitts every two months, and a passenger ship of this line or of the Elders & Fyffes Line will call at Antigua sailing direct to or from England if a sufficient number of passengers offers, but this is usually only once a year in both directions. Normally, passengers travelling between England and the Leeward Islands travel direct between England and Barbados by the Elders & Fyffes Line, or Harrison Line, or the Royal Dutch West India Line, etc., and between Barbados and the Leeward Islands by Canadian National Steamships or by the Furness Bermuda Line.
- Passengers may also travel to or from England via New York or Canada by the Lines mentioned, but in practice, the route via Barbados is usually adopted for passenger traffic for Europe.

**Posts and Telegraphs.**

Mails with Great Britain are exchanged via New York, and occasionally via Barbados, and direct with Canada, the United States and the British West Indies.

There are 48 Post Offices in the Colony and the rates of postage are as follows:

- **Inland.**—Letters, 1d. for the first 2 oz., ½d. per additional 2 oz.; Post cards, ½d.

- **Other places.**—Letters, 2½d. for the first oz., 1½d. per additional oz.; Post cards, 1½d.

**All places.**—Printed matter, ½d. per 2 oz.

Telephone Systems are maintained by the Government in Antigua, St. Kitts, Dominica, and Montserrat.

**Parcel Post.**

Parcel post despatches are exchanged with Great Britain via Barbados, Canada and New York (limit of weight 22 lb.) and direct with Canada (limit 15 lb.), the United States (limit 22 lb.) and British West Indies (limit 22 lb.).
British Imperial Postal Orders are issued and paid in the Colony and Money Orders are exchanged direct with Great Britain, Canada, the United States and British West Indian Colonies.

Telegraph communication is maintained by means of Wireless operated by the Pacific Cable Board, there being stations at Antigua, Dominica and St. Kitts, all of which communicate with one another and with Barbados for telegrams to the United Kingdom, Canada, North America, etc. There is also a wireless station in Montserrat maintained by the Colonial Government but operated by the Pacific Cable Board.

The principal tariffs are:

- To England: 2/4d. per word.
- To Eastern Canada: 1/6d., " "
- To Western Canada: 1/8d., "

Education.

The system of elementary education is denominational in Montserrat and the Virgin Islands, the various denominations being Anglicans, Moravians, Wesleyans and Roman Catholics. In St. Kitts-Nevis the State-aided denominational schools were closed at the end of the financial year 1914-15, and by amalgamating certain schools in proximity one to another the number of schools was reduced to 33, which are under the sole control of the Government and are entirely supported from public funds. On 31st March, 1928, there were 101 aided and Government schools in the Colony. The clergy of the various denominations are granted facilities for giving religious instruction during school hours to the children of their respective churches. During the financial year 1927-28 the Government grants to all the elementary schools in the Colony amounted to 16,662. 4s. 1½d.

School fees have now been abolished in all public elementary schools throughout the colony. The schools are required to receive all children applying for admission. Grants-in-aid are refused to superfluous or inefficient schools. In the 101 aided and Government schools there were enrolled on 31st March, 1928, 24,823 children, with a daily average attendance of 15,947. Grants of varying amounts are also made to grammar or high schools established in each Presidency, except Montserrat and the Virgin Islands. Provision is also made for agricultural instruction. The amount of Government Grant to secondary schools in the Colony was 2,907l.

Civil Service.

A system of grading civil service clerks has been established throughout the Colony. The pay assigned to the several grades is as follows:

- Assistant Clerks (Men) £25–£5–£90.
- Junior Clerks (Men) £100–£10–£200.
- Senior Clerks (Women) £100–£10–£160.
