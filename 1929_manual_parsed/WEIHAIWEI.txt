WEIHAIWEI.

History and Description.

The territory of Weihaiwei was leased to Great Britain by China by a Convention signed at Peking, on the 1st July, 1898.—"in order to provide Great Britain with a suitable Naval harbour in North China and for the better protection of British commerce in the neighbouring seas."

The leased territory, which lies in latitude 37°30' N., longitude 122°10' E., is situated in the Chinese Province of Shantung, on the North-Eastern coast of the Shantung Peninsula. It comprises the Island of Liukung, all the islands in the Bay of Weihaiwei, and a belt of land ten English miles wide along the entire coast line.

The bay is six miles broad and from three to four wide. To it there is easy access from the Eastern and Western passages, the former being two-and-a-quarter miles wide, the latter two-thirds of a mile wide. These two channels are formed by the Island of Liukung, which, lying east and west across the Bay and being two miles long and three-quarters of a mile wide, forms a protection to the anchorage.

Weihaiwei is an easy place for shipping to make, and battleships and ocean steamers are able to lie close to the shore. The harbour is lighted by two lighthouses.

The territory has been surveyed by the Royal Engineers and mapped on a scale of two inches to a mile. The total area is 285 square miles, including the Island of Liukung.

Great Britain has also "the right to erect fortifications, station troops, or take any other measures necessary for defensive purposes at any points on or near the coast of the region East of the Meridian 121° 40' East of Greenwich, and to acquire on equitable compensation within that territory such sites as may be necessary for water supply, communications and hospitals. Within that zone Chinese administration will not be interfered with, but no troops other than Chinese or British shall be allowed therein." This zone has been surveyed on a scale of one inch to a mile, and its area has been fixed at 1,506 square miles. The territory has a picturesque and diversified coast line seventy-two miles in length. Its
surface consists of abrupt ranges of rugged hills, rising to a height of 1,600 feet, and well-cultivated valleys, watered by streams which during the dry season are mere rivulets. All the hills are terraced for cultivation, so far as possible, and in many instances are planted with dwarf pine and scrub oak, but their general appearance is barren; the strata of the mountains are metamorphic, consisting of beds of quartite, gneiss and crystalline limestone cut across by dykes of volcanic rock and granite.

There are over 350 villages, and the Chinese population (according to the census of 1921) is 154,416. Since 1921 it has increased considerably partly owing to the growth of prosperity of the port, and also to the influx of some of the inhabitants of the neighbouring Chinese districts, who have suffered greatly from disturbed political conditions and banditry.

The chief port of the territory is named Port Edward, in commemoration of the coronation of His Majesty King Edward VII.

Negotiations for the rendition of the territory to China, in accordance with the decisions taken at the Conference of Washington were practically concluded in 1924, but owing to the absence of a settled government in China it has not yet been found possible to give effect to the draft Convention under which rendition was to be effected.

Climate.

The climate is regarded as one of the best in China. The winter is cold and bracing, and the summer heat is not excessive. The average maximum temperature in the shade is about 95° F., and the minimum about 10°. The maximum temperature during the summer of 1928 was much higher than usual and reached 105°. The rainfall is very small, averaging about 24 inches a year. The wettest months are July and August.

Constitution and Government.

The Government is administered by a Commissioner, appointed under His Majesty's Sign Manual and Signet, who discharges his functions under the Weihaiwei Order in Council of the 24th July, 1901. Under that instrument the Commissioner is empowered to make Ordinances, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, for the administration of the territory, and provision is made for a High Court, in which all jurisdiction, civil and criminal, is vested, subject to an appeal to the Supreme Court of Hong Kong, and for District Magistrates' Courts.

The village communities are administered through their headmen in accordance with Chinese custom.

During the summer months Weihaiwei is used by His Majesty's fleet on the China Station as a sanatorium and exercising ground, and is frequented by visitors who are attracted by its climate. During the summer of 1927 a convalescent camp was established for officers and men of the Shanghai Defence Force. The 1st Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment was also stationed at Weihaiwei from June to the end of September.

The territory previous to 1922-23 was assisted by a grant-in-aid from Imperial funds, but since that time has been entirely self-supporting.

The revenue for 1928-29 was estimated at £340,719, and the expenditure at £325,412.

In previous years the statistics were:

| Year   | Revenue | Expenditure | Grant-in-Aid |

| 1927-28 | 275,946 | 247,013     | —            |

The administration of Weihaiwei was first undertaken by the Senior Naval Officer on the station in 1898. In the following year it was transferred to a Military and Civil Commissioner appointed by the War Office. On the 1st January, 1901, the territory was handed over to the control of the Colonial Office, and a Civil Commissioner assumed the administration of the Government in 1902.

WESTERN PACIFIC.

High Commission.

The office of High Commissioner in, over, and for the Western Pacific Islands, was created by an Order in Council, cited as the Western Pacific Order in Council of 1877.

The jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends over all islands in the Western Pacific not being within the limits of the Colonies of Fiji, Queensland, New South Wales, or New Zealand, and not being within the jurisdiction of any other civilised Power. In 1893 a new Order in Council was issued, known as the Pacific Order in Council, 1893, in accordance with which the High Commissioner's jurisdiction is extended to foreigners and (in most cases) to natives residing in British settlements or protectorates within the limits of the Order. Under the provisions of the New Hebrides Order in Council, 1922, the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner extends also to the islands in the Pacific Ocean known as the New Hebrides, and all the islands known as the Banks Islands and Torres Islands. The expenses of the High Commission at Suva, Fiji, are met from the funds of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands.
Colony and the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, but a contribution is paid from Imperial funds in respect of work in connection with Tonga and the New Hebrides.

The Chief Justice of Fiji, and every other Judge for the time being of the Supreme Court of Fiji, is by virtue of his office a Judicial Commissioner.

Deputy Commissioners are appointed by the High Commissioner on behalf of His Majesty.

The High Commissioner's Court consists of the High Commissioner, the Judicial Commissioners, and the Deputy Commissioners, and in it is vested all His Majesty's civil and criminal jurisdiction exercisable in the Western Pacific Islands.

The Court of a Judicial Commissioner has powers similar to those of the Superior Courts of England, and the Deputy Commissioners have civil jurisdiction in Common Law, Equity and Bankruptcy, with a limited jurisdiction in Probate, and have a criminal jurisdiction in respect of offences not punishable with seven years' penal servitude or upwards.

With some few exceptions all decisions of the High Commissioner's Court may be appealed against to the Supreme Court of Fiji.

In addition to the other means of preserving order the High Commissioner has certain special powers for the deportation of persons whose proceedings endanger the peace of the Islands.

The principal groups under the High Commissioner are:

- The Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony.
- The British Solomon Islands Protectorate.
- Tonga.
- The New Hebrides.
- The Phoenix Group.
- Pitcairn Island.

Particulars of these are given below.

**THE GILBERT AND ELICE ISLANDS COLONY.**

A British Protectorate was proclaimed over the Gilbert Islands by Commanding Officer H. M. Davis of H.M.S. "Royalist" on behalf of Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, at Abemama, on the 27th May, 1892. The Ellice Islands were declared a Protectorate in September of the same year.

The jurisdiction of the Resident Commissioner of the Protectorates was extended to Ocean Island by a Proclamation issued on 28th November, 1900.

By the expressed desire of the Native Governments the first two groups were annexed to and formed part of His Majesty's Dominions by an Order in Council of the 10th November, 1915, and were known as the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony as from the 12th January, 1916. Ocean, Fanning and Washington Islands were included within the boundaries of the Colony by an Order of His Majesty in Council of the 27th January, 1916, which came into operation on the 3rd April of that year.

The Union group of Islands was brought in by Order in Council of the 29th February, 1916, operating from the 5th May, 1916; but by the Union Islands (No. 1) Order in Council 1925, dated the 4th Nov., 1925, the boundaries of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony were altered so as to exclude the Union Islands, which by the Union Islands (No. 2) Order in Council, 1925, of the same date were placed under the Governor Gen. in Council of the Dominion of New Zealand. These Orders in Council came into force on 11th Feb., 1926.

Christmas Island was also included in the Colony by Order in Council of the 30th July, 1919, taking effect from the 10th November, 1919.

The total population of the Colony at the Census of April, 1921, was 29,897, of whom 264 were Europeans, 348 Asiatics, and 29,285 Pacific Island natives. The first included 74 females, and the last 14,206.

The total population on the 30th June, 1927, was 30,334.

**Ocean Island** (Paanopa or Banaba), in lat. 0° 52' S., long. 169° 35' E., about 1,500 acres in extent, is the Headquarters of the Government and the site of operations of the British Phosphate Commission. The population of Ocean Island in 1921 was 1,785. Of these 115 were Europeans, 80 of whom were men and 65 of this latter number employees of the British Phosphate Commission. The natives numbered 1,356, of these 546 being Banabans and 672 representing the Gilbertese employees of the British Phosphate Commission. Besides this labour force, the Commission recruit men from China, of whom there were 312 at Ocean Island at the 1921 Census. The population of the Island at the 30th June, 1927, was as follows:

| Men | Women | Children | Totals |
|-----|-------|----------|--------|
| Europeans | 70 | 29 | 14 | 113 |
| Asiatics | 456 | - | - | 456 |
| Gilbert & Ellice | Labourers | 806 | 248 | 304 | 1388 |
| Banabans | 158 | 186 | 197 | 540 |

1490 | 462 | 515 | 2467

The Wireless Station at Ocean Island was opened for traffic on the 14th March, 1916.
public service via Suvaradio to all parts of the world was inaugurated on the 16th August, 1922. As a direct result of this a new and cheaper rate to Ocean Island from Australia via Rabaul came into operation on the 1st January, 1923.

Wireless communications with the Groups are maintained through the small station (½ K.W.) erected by Messrs. Burns, Philp & Co., Tarawa; the radio installation in the local trading vessel of Messrs. On Chong & Co., whose headquarters are at Butaritari, and the London Missionary Society's ¼ K.W. Station at Beru. The British Phosphate Commission has a ½ K.W. Telephony Station at Ocean Island for communication with the island of Nauru, and their steamship "Nauru Chief."

The Gilbert and Ellice Groups.—The Gilbert Group is comprised of the following sixteen islands:—Makin, Butaritari, Marakei, Abaiang, Tarawa, Maiana, Kuria, Aranuka and Abemama (Northern Gilberts); Nonouti and Tabiteuea (Central Gilberts); Onotoa, Beru, Nukunau, Tamana and Arore (Southern Gilberts).

The Ellice Islands are the following nine:—Nanumanga, Nanumaga, Nui, Vaitupu, Nukufetau, Funafuti, Nukulaelae and Nukutavake.

The two groups consist of a series of coral atolls lying between 4° N. latitude and 10° S. and 170° to 180° E. longitude with an area of 180 square miles. The principal export is copra.

The population of the Gilbert Group at the 1921 census was 23,318. Of these, 75 were Europeans, 23 Asiatics and 23,220 natives, of whom 11,791 were males.

The population of the Ellice Group at the 1921 census was 3,457, 22 of whom were Europeans, 6 Asiatics, 3,429 natives, 1,706 of the last being males.

The natives are of Malayo-Polynesian race. The majority are adherents either of the London Missionary Society or the Roman Catholic Mission of the Sacred Heart. There is no similarity between the languages of the Gilbert and Ellice Groups. With few exceptions the hereditary chieftainships have ceased to exist, but each island has its own native government, presided over by a native magistrate. A revised code of native laws is validated by an Ordinance of the Colony, and law and order is well maintained under the general supervision of European officials. Revenue is obtained from a copra tax, trading and other licences, import and export duties, non-native capitation tax, etc.

Fanning and Washington Islands lie about 3° 51' N. latitude, and 159° 21' W. longitude. There is no indigenous population but labour is recruited from the Gilbert Islands for the copra industry. There were 102 of these at the 1921 Census. A District Officer is in charge of these islands under the Resident Commissioner. On Fanning Island is the mid-ocean Station of the Pacific Cable Board, whose employees and their wives comprise practically the entire European population of 37. There is no regular communication between these islands and the rest of the colony; periodical visits are made for engaging and repatriating labour by a small auxiliary vessel of the Fanning Island Company. The total population on the 30th June, 1927, was 517.

Christmas Island (about 1° 59' N. latitude, 157° 30' W. longitude) lies 164 miles South-East by East of Fanning Island. Under the terms of a License dated the 27th October, 1914, the Central Pacific Coconut Plantations Limited of London were granted the exclusive right to occupy the island for their own use for the planting of coconuts, the manufacture of copra, the export of coconut oil, pearl shell and guano during the term of 87 years from the 1st January, 1914. The population is 23. The port of entry for Christmas Island is Fanning Island, so that all inward entries and outward clearances must be made at the latter port.

Periodical visits are made by H.M.'s ships. The first visit of inspection by a District Officer since the inclusion of Christmas Island within the Colony was made in March, 1922, in H.M.S. "Calculta." The area is about 60,000 acres, of which 1,200 are under coconuts. There are no postal arrangements, the only mails that reach the island being carried by the ships chartered by the lessee in Tahiti.

The climate of all the groups is fairly healthy for Europeans, but the natives suffer from lung diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis. A considerable amount of medical work has been undertaken of late years and a large central hospital is maintained at Tarawa in the Gilbert Group. Every Island has a native hospital under the charge of a native student trained at the Tarawa Hospital.

Communication between the various islands is infrequent, depending on the irregular movements of vessels belonging to or chartered by Messrs. Burns, Philp and Company, Limited, On Chong and Company, and the British Phosphate Commissioners.

The Revenue and Expenditure of the Colony have been as follows:

| Year     | Revenue | Expenditure |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| 1917-18 | £26,098 | £27,501     |

THE BRITISH SOLOMON ISLANDS PROTECTORATE.

The British Solomon Islands consist of the southern islands of the group, viz., Shortland Island, Choiseul, Isabel, New Georgia, Guadalcanar, Malaita, San Cristoval, Bellona, and Rennell Islands, together with Ongtong-Java, Santa Cruz, Duff, and Reef Groups, and other smaller islands in the vicinity of the main group, and all lying between the 7th and 13th degrees of south latitude, and the 150th and 163rd degrees of east longitude. The natives are in the main, Melanesians, but showing traces of the intrusion of small bodies of Polynesians and others. The native population has been estimated, approximately, at 150,000, but is about stationary now. Large numbers were carried off by dysentery during the eighteen months ended March 31st, 1915. Malaita is the most densely populated, estimated population 60,000. The natives have been described as treacherous, but of late years have shown themselves amenable to law and civilisation. All emigration of native labourers to places beyond the limits of the Protectorate has been stopped by legislation. There have long been a few traders, mostly of British nationality, resident in the islands; these have now increased largely in number, and in the extent of their operations. Lever Bros. and Burns, Philip and Co., have undertaken coco-nut planting on a large scale, and employ a large number of white men in overseeing and superintending the native labour. The estimated area of land planted with coco-nuts in December, 1924, amounted to 50,000 acres. The non-native population in 1914 numbered 660 Europeans, in 1919 numbered 675 Europeans and 75 Asiatics, in 1922, 493 Europeans and 90 Foreigners, in 1924, 338 Europeans and 100 Asiatics. The principal articles of trade are copra, green snail and trochus shells, ivory nuts, pearl shell, and tortoise shell. The climate is unhealthy, malaria being very prevalent, especially during the North-West season, which lasts from the end of October to the beginning of March. Lung diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis, are common among the natives. These islands were placed under British protection in 1893. The headquarters of the Protectorate is at Tulagi, a small island off Florida. District Officers are stationed at Shortland Island, Mala, Gizo, San Cristoval, Guadalcanal, Ysabel and Santa Cruz. There is regular steam communication with Sydney, New South Wales.

TONGA.

The Tongan, or Friendly Islands, with an area of about 250 square miles, are situated between the 18th and 22nd degrees of south latitude. They were discovered by Tasman in 1643. Most of the islands are of coral formation, but some are active volcanoes, notably Tofua, Kao, and Niuafoou (Good Hope Island). The natives belong to the Polynesian race, and are closely allied to the natives of New Zealand and Samoa. The islands are very rich in coconuts; and copra forms the principal export. There is monthly communication by steamer with Auckland via Fiji and Samoa. Passengers goods and mails from other countries tranship, as a rule, at Suva. During the dry season, i.e., from April to December, steamers of the Norwegian Australian Line call at regular intervals for copra freights.

Census of Population, December, 1926:

| Category       | Number |
|----------------|--------|
| Tongans        | 26,128 |
| Europeans      | 611    |
| Half-castes    | 225    |
| Others         | 367    |
| Total          | 27,331 |

In 1845 George Tubou I, who was the first to establish an effective government over the whole of Tonga, was proclaimed King. The queen is assisted by a Parliament and a Privy Council. The Privy Council is composed of four Europeans and six Native Ministers of the Crown who are also heads of the various government departments. The civil service is composed mostly of Tongans, the European officials numbering about 37. The general tariff is 12½% ad valorem and there are no preferential duties. Licences are charged for carrying on stores and trades.

The climate may be considered a healthy one. The thermometer ranges between 53 and 93 degrees Fahrenheit.

There are six churches in Tonga, viz., the Wesleyan Free Church of Tonga, with about 16,000 adherents; the Free Church of Tonga, with about 7,000; the Roman Catholic Mission, with about 3,000; the Church of England, 240; the Church of Latter Day Saints, 630; and the Seventh Day Adventist Mission, with about 60 adherents.

The Wesleyan Mission was first founded in Tonga in the year 1826, and a few years later the chiefs and people embraced Christianity and became members of the Church. The control and management of the Mission in Tonga were entrusted about the year 1857 to the Australasian Conference and continued until the year 1885, when King George Tubou I, after trying unsuccessfully to obtain local autonomy for the Church in Tonga, seceded, with a large majority of his chiefs and people and, with the assistance of the Rev. Shirley Baker, established the Wesleyan...
Free Church of Tonga as a separate and independent body though retaining the same doctrines, discipline and form of worship as the Wesleyan Church. In January, 1887, an attempt was made by some escaped native convicts on the life of Mr. Shirley Baker, the Premier. The attempt was made the pretext for increased persecution of the "Fakaogos," or members of the Wesleyan Mission Church. About 100, whom no ill-use could induce to abandon the Mission Church, were ordered to be deported to Pylstart Island, a barren islet south of Tonga, but they were finally allowed to go to Fiji. Shortly after an inquiry was made into the causes of the disturbances by Sir Charles Mitchell. At this inquiry the allegation that the attempt on Mr. Baker's life was due to a "Fakaoigo" conspiracy was abandoned, and a letter written by Mr. Baker, purporting to be signed by the king, was addressed to Sir Charles Mitchell, promising an amnesty to political prisoners and freedom of worship. The services in the Mission Church at once recommenced.

In 1890 complaints were made that freedom of worship was still being interfered with; that persons were deprived of their lands and unjustly imprisoned on account of their adherence to the Wesleyan Church; and Tongan officials denied that the king had written to Sir Charles Mitchell promising to accord freedom of worship. Sir John Thurston therefore made a further inquiry, and finding that Mr. Baker was the principal cause of the wrongs endured by the Wesleyans, he issued an Order prohibiting Mr. Baker from being within the group for a term of two years from the 17th July, 1890. A few days before the issue of the Order, the king, on the request of the leading chiefs, had dismissed the Premier from office, and a fresh Government was formed with a native Premier (Tukuafo). Under the new Government the fullest freedom of worship was allowed, and the exiles were recalled from Fiji, the king having requested Sir John Thurston to make arrangements for their return.

In the year 1923 much dissatisfaction existed in the Wesleyan Free Church, and an enquiry that was held into the state of the finances disclosed a very lax state of affairs. As a result of this enquiry it was decided to approach the Wesleyan Church with a view to the union of the two bodies as a separate and independent Conference of the Wesleyan Methodist Church. At a joint conference of the two churches held in April, 1924, union was decided upon. A minority, under the leadership of the late Rev. J. A. Watkin, declined to join the united body and carried on under the title of the Free Church of Tonga. Protracted litigation ensued as a result of this division in respect of the ownership of the churches and property of the Wesleyan Free Church of Tonga established by King George I in 1885. It was finally decided on appeal in favour of the united Church, of which the present Queen is the head.

King George Tubou died on 18th February, 1893, and was succeeded by his great-grandson, George Taufahau, under the title of George Tubou II. On the death of the latter on the 5th April, 1918, Princess Salote, his daughter by his first wife the late Queen Lavinia, succeeded to the throne. The young Queen, who was born on the 13th March, 1900, was married in 1917 to Prince Uliami Tugi, the present Premier, and chief of highest rank in Tonga.

Early in 1900 Mr. Basil Thomson was sent out to Tonga by Her Majesty's Government, and concluded a Treaty with the king by which the latter placed himself and his territory under Her Majesty's protection. A protectorate was proclaimed on 18th May, 1900.

In December, 1904, and January, 1905, the High Commissioner, Sir Everard im Thurn, spent some time in Tonga, re-organising the system of administration—which had by that time fallen into some disorder and received an undertaking from the king of more strict compliance with the liabilities assumed by him under the Treaty of 1900. The Premier, Jiosateki Toga, and the Treasurer were removed to Fiji, under an Order in Council; and Jione Matalaona was appointed to the Premiership, which office he held until 30th September, 1912, when he resigned. He was succeeded by Tevita Tuivakano, who retired from office on 30th June, 1922. The present premier, Uliami Tugi, is the Prince Consort, and was formerly Minister for Lands. The progress of Tonga since 1905 has been satisfactory.

Every Tongan is entitled to an allotment of land for cultivation, so that no unemployment exists.

Primary education for Tongans between the ages of 6 and 14 is compulsory. There are two boys' colleges at which provision is made for secondary education. Secondary education of girls is entirely in the hands of the christian missions. Medical work is well organised; and, unlike most native communities in the Pacific, the native population steadily increases in number.

British and foreign nationals are subject to the jurisdiction of the Tongan Court only for offences against Tongan laws relating to customs, taxes, quarantine, and local police, not recognised as offences against British law. In other respects they are subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of the High Commissioner.

THE NEW HEBRIDES.

The New Hebrides, to which are attached the Banks and Torres Islands, lie between the 12th and 20th degrees of south latitude, and the 165th and 170th degrees of east longitude. The area is about 5,700 sq. miles.

The population is estimated at—

| British Nationals | ... | ... | 211 |
| French Nationals | ... | ... | 680 |
| Foreigners | ... | ... | 33 |
| Asiatics and Protected French Subjects | ... | ... | 3,675 |
| Native Population about | ... | ... | 60,000 |

Total | ... | ... | 64,599

The natives are Melanesians, but in many places there is an admixture of Polynesian blood. The Europeans are mostly British or French.

Missions have been established by the Melanesian Missionary Society, by the Presbyterian churches of Canada and Australia, and by the Roman Catholic Church.

The principal exports are copra, cocoa, cotton, coffee, trochus; maize, hides and various miscellaneous products are also exported. The climate of most of the islands is rather unhealthy and malarial fever is prevalent. At first, a joint commission, of British and French naval officers, was appointed to protect the lives and property of British and French subjects, and to maintain order. British and French Residents were appointed in 1902. In February, 1906, a conference of British and French officials took place in London, and a draft convention was prepared to provide for the settlement of land claims, and for an arrangement which would put an end to the difficulties arising from the absence of jurisdiction over the natives. A convention confirming the above-mentioned draft was signed in London on October 20th, 1906, and was provisionally proclaimed at Vila, the chief town of the New Hebrides, on December 2nd, 1907. Its provisions include the establishment of a joint court, and of an executive government consisting, for some purposes, of the British and French representatives in the group acting in concert. For other purposes British and French nationals remain subject to the control only of their own authorities.

A Protocol drawn up in London in 1914 to replace the Convention of 1906, was ratified on March 18th, 1922. It was proclaimed in the New Hebrides in August, 1923.

British and French Resident Commissioners, subordinate to their respective High Commissioners, each with a staff of officers have been appointed.

The Islands are of coral formation, and several of them are planted with coconuts. All except McKean and Enderbury Islands are leased to the Samoa Shipping and Trading Company for 87 years, from 1st January, 1914.

PITCAIRN ISLAND.

Pitcairn Island (two square miles) is situated in the Pacific Ocean, nearly equidistant from Australia and America (25° 3' S. lat., 130° 8' E. long). It was discovered by Carteret in 1767, but remained
uninhabited until 1790, when it was occupied by the mutineers of H.M.S. "Bounty," with some women from Otaheite. Nothing was known of their existence until the island was visited in 1808. No regular government was established, but assistance of various kinds was given on the subsequent visits of English vessels. In 1856, the population having become too large for the island's resources, the inhabitants (192 in number) were, at their own request, removed, with all their possessions, to Norfolk Island; but 40 of them soon returned. In 1879 these had increased to 90. The population in 1914 was 140 (35 adult males, 39 adult females, 66 children).

It is a British Colony by settlement, and was brought within the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner for the W. Pacific in 1898 under s. 6 of the Pacific Order in Council, 1893. Chief Magistrate, Parkin Christian.

The islands of Henderson, Ducie and Oeno were annexed in 1902, and are included in the district of Pitcairn.
