FALKLAND ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Falkland Islands ("Les Iles Malouines" of the French, "Islas Malvinas" of the Spaniards) are situated in the South Atlantic Ocean, between 51° and 53° S. lat., and between 57° and 62° W. long., about 480 miles N. E. of Cape Horn, and about 1,000 miles due south of Monte Video. They consist of East Falkland Island and West Falkland Island, which, with the adjacent islets, have an area of 2,580 square miles and 2,038 square miles respectively.

There are two groups of dependencies (i) South Georgia with South Orkney and South Sandwich, the boundaries being the 50th parallel of south latitude and the 20th and 50th meridians of west longitude (ii) South Shetland and Graham Land bounded by the parallel of latitude 58° S., and the meridians of longitude 50° and 80° W. The territory of both the dependencies extends to the South Pole.

This area contains about 3,100,000 square miles or 14½% of the entire surface of the globe, and one-fifth approximately of the total area of the
British Empire. Much of it is ice-bound, but there are more than a million square miles of sea readily accessible for whaling, fishing and sealing.

The island of South Georgia lies about 800 miles to the east of the Falkland Islands, South Orkney and South Sandwich being about 450 miles to the south-west and south-east respectively of South Georgia. The northern point of South Shetland is about 500 miles to the south of the Falklands.

History.

The Falklands were discovered by Davis in 1592, and visited by Hawkins in 1594. In 1764 they were taken possession of by France and Bougainville planted a small colony of Acadians at Port Louis in East Falkland. Bougainville was bought out by Spain, ever jealous of interference by other nations in the southern seas, in 1766.

In the following year Captain Byron took possession of West Falkland, and left a small garrison at Port Egmont on Saunders Island, whence it was driven out by the Spaniards in 1770; this action on the part of Spain brought that country and Britain to the verge of war. The Spaniards restored the island in 1771, but it was abandoned in 1774 and no further formal occupation was made until 1820, when the Republic of Buenos Aires established a settlement which was destroyed by the Americans in 1831.

In 1832 occupation of the islands was resumed by the British Government for the protection of the whale fishery. Until 1843, they were under the charge of the Naval officers engaged in making Admiralty surveys. In 1843, a Civil Administration was formed, the headquarters being at Port Louis until the following year when they were removed to Stanley, then known as Port William.

The colony received regular grants in aid from 1841 until 1880 and for a mail service until 1884-5, since which year the colony has been self-supporting.

On the 8th of December, 1914, in an action off the Falklands, a British squadron under the late Admiral Sir F. C. Doveton Sturdee defeated and sank a German squadron consisting of two armoured cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, two light cruisers, Leipzig and Nurnberg, and two transports. The light cruiser Dresden, having escaped from this action was subsequently sunk in March, 1915. No British ships were lost, and the total British casualties were seven killed and twelve wounded.

South Georgia and the South Sandwich group were discovered in 1775 by Captain James Cook, who took possession of them for Britain. South Shetland was discovered and taken possession of by Captain William Smith in 1819, and South Orkney by Captain G. Powell in 1821.

The dependencies were visited only by exploring expeditions, sealers, and whalers until the rise of the modern whaling industry in those regions.

In May, 1916, Sir Ernest Shackleton arrived in Stanley in a whale catcher from South Georgia, having left 22 members of his exploring expedition on Elephant Island, South Shetland, while he made his way to South Georgia to seek help. He had sailed 700 miles in an open boat with five companions and had crossed South Georgia on foot for the first time in its history. Every member of the expedition was saved.

General Description.

(a) Falkland Islands.

The Falkland Islands have a very deeply indented coast line and many good natural harbours. The surface is hilly, attaining its maximum elevation of 2,315 feet in Mount Adam, West Falkland.

The entire country is covered with wild moorland interrupted by outcrops of rock and the peculiar collections of angular boulders named "stone runs."

There is no cultivation except in the immediate vicinity of the settlements and shepherds' houses where vegetables and in a few places hay is grown. The soil is chiefly peat but considerable areas of sand also occur.

Communication is maintained by sea and horses, but there are no roads outside Stanley, the traveller being guided by natural landmarks. Trees are completely absent.

The only town is Stanley in East Falkland, with a population of about 950. The houses are mostly iron and wood, built as they are required for occupation. It is difficult to rent a house but there are several boarding houses affording fair accommodation. Stanley is a port of register and had, on the 31st December, 1927, nineteen vessels aggregating 25,660 tons.

The cost of mutton is 3d. per lb., of beef 5d., fowls' eggs when procurable cost 3d. to 3½d. each, while penguin eggs in spring are sold at a price varying from 4s. to 8s. 6d. per hundred. Milk is priced at 1s. per quart. Most foodstuffs have to be imported.

Climate and Health.

In the Falklands the temperature is uniformly low, ranging from 40° to 65° in summer and from 30° to 50° in winter, with an annual mean of 42°.

The annual rainfall seldom exceeds 25 inches, and although snow falls frequently it does not as a rule lie long. In summer the atmosphere is very dry and evaporation rapid.

The climate is rigorous but healthy. It is rendered trying to people from the United Kingdom on account of the continuous cold and lack of sun and the constant high winds as well as the few opportunities afforded for outdoor exercise. The conditions of living are generally comparable with those obtaining in small towns in the north of Scotland, except that by natural situation the Colony is very isolated and its resources and horizons very limited. A difficulty is experienced in providing any variety of diet and in particular fresh meat other than mutton, and fresh fruit and vegetables are at most times difficult to obtain. The birth rate in 1927 was 22·3 per 1,000 and the death rate 9·6.

(b) Dependencies.

The island of South Georgia is a mass of high mountains which are covered with deep snow where they are not too precipitous, while the valleys between are filled with glaciers which in many cases descend to the sea. There is a coastal fringe free from snow in summer and more or less clothed with vegetation, including tussock 'grass.' Land whaling stations have been established in five of the numerous bays.

The remaining dependencies are even more inhospitable, being nearly completely covered with snow and ice and almost entirely destitute of plant life. All the dependencies have a rigorous climate of Antarctic character.

A land whaling station is operated during the summer months at Deception Island in the South Shetland group.
Industries.

The inhabitants of the Falkland Islands are almost entirely occupied in sheep farming, the whole acreage of the colony being divided into large sheep runs. Wool is the principal product but tallow and hides are also exported. There were in 1927 606,521 sheep, 8,634 cattle and 3,045 horses in the islands.

The whaling field of the dependencies, in which whaling by modern methods was first carried on in 1852, has become more productive than all those in the rest of the world combined; a small quantity of seal oil is also produced.

An expedition for research, mainly into whaling, for which the ships "Discovery" and "William Scoresby" have been acquired, has been operating in the southern seas.

Education.

There are two schools in Stanley. A Government school is maintained from public funds, which, whilst being elementary in character, also makes provision for attendance at a Continuation Class for a two-year course of further education. This学校 also cares for children from the country districts, whose parents are willing to send them to Stanley to be educated. These children are either boarded and lodged in a Government Hostel and taught in the school at a small inclusive charge, or if boarded in private houses, the Government contributes towards the cost. There is also a Convent School managed by Roman Catholic Sisters; this school, however, is not subject to Government control, and receives no subsidy.

Two travelling teachers are provided by the Government and two by the Falkland Islands Company. These teachers travel from Settlement to Settlement devoting a certain amount of time to each. The number of children receiving education in the Colony in 1927 was 394.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, and local 5s., 1½s., and 10s. notes. There are no private banks in the Colony. On 1st April, 1883, a Government Savings Bank was established, in which, on 30th September, 1927, the deposits were £131,167½., belonging to 927 depositors.

Falkland Islands Company, Limited.

This company was formed in 1851 to take over from Mr. Lafone, of Monte Video, the district in the East Falkland, now called Lolaire: this district abounded with wild cattle, said to be the descendants of the stock introduced by the Acadian settlers, the capture of which was the company's original object. This, however, was not found profitable, and the company have of late years been engaged in sheep farming on an extensive scale, in shipping, and in the importation of goods.

The company maintains a doctor and a school at Darwin, and contributes to the provision of a salary for a clergyman of the Church of England.

Means of Communication.

The vessels of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company call at Stanley on their voyage round South America on an average six times a year in either direction. In order to supplement this service and with a view to ensuring mail communication with the United Kingdom at intervals of not more than a month the Government has recently made arrangements for a steamer belonging to the Tonsberg Whaling Company to make voyages as required to and from Monte Video, where the mails are transhipped to Europe. Few passenger steamers call at Stanley but passages can, as a rule, be obtained by cargo vessels either direct to England or via Monte Video, whence the voyage can be continued by passenger liner. Inter-island communication, at approximately monthly intervals, is maintained by the coasting steamer belonging to the Falkland Islands Company, Limited, and by special sailings arranged by the Government. Communication with the Dependencies is maintained by the Tonsberg Whaling Company, under contract with the Government.

The rates of postage are as follows:

Boston wireless stations for external traffic are maintained by the Government, one at Stanley on Cumberland Bay, Grytviken, in the Dependency of South Georgia. One smaller station at Fox Bay on the West Falkland is maintained also by the Government for inter-insular communication. The traffic is transmitted and receive principally through Monte Video. Telegraphic charges are 4½, 2½a word to the United Kingdom and 1⅓s. 2¼a word to Monte Video. The installation of direct communication on short-wave with the United Kingdom is at present under consideration. The principal farms on East Falkland Island are connected by telephone with the Stanley exchange and those also on West Falkland Island with the Government headquarters at Fox Bay.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council composed of three official members and one unofficial member, and a Legislative Council composed of three official and two unofficial members. The unofficial members of the Legislative Council are appointed by Warrant under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet for a term not exceeding five years.
