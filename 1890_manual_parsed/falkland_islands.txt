FALKLAND ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Falkland Islands ("Les Iles Malouines" of the French, "Islas Malvinas" of the Spaniards) are situated in the South Atlantic Ocean, between 51° and 53° S. lat., and between 57° and 62° W. long.; they consist of the East Falkland (area 3,000 square miles), the West Falkland (2,800 square miles), and about 100 small islands with an area of nearly 1,200 square miles. Mount Adam, the highest ground in the colony, rises 2,315 feet above the level of the sea.

South Georgia, a group of islands 54½° S. and 36° to 38° W., is a dependency of the Falkland Islands. It was discovered by Antony La Roche in 1675, and was explored and taken possession of by Captain Cook in 1775. It has an area of about 1,000 square miles, and is uninhabited. The German expedition for observing the transit of Venus landed here in August, 1882, and remained until September, 1883. The total area of the colony is about 7,500 square miles.

History.

The Falklands were discovered by Davis in 1592, and visited by Hawkins in 1594. In 1763 they were taken possession of by France; subsequently, they were held by the Spaniards until 1771, when they were for a time abandoned, and the sovereignty of them given up to Great Britain.

In 1820 the Republic of Buenos Ayres established a settlement in these islands, which was destroyed by the Americans in 1831.

In 1833 they were taken possession of by the British Government, for the protection of the Whale Fishery. Until 1842 they were under the charge of the Naval officers engaged in making the Admiralty Surveys. In 1842 a civil administration was formed, the headquarters being at Port Louis (or "Anson") until 1844, when it was moved to Port William, now known as Stanley. The Colony received regular grants in aid from 1841 to 1860, and for mail service down to 1884-5, since which date it has been self-supporting.

General Description.

The only town is Stanley, in the East Falkland, with a population of 725. There is a small hamlet at Darwin. Stanley is a port of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1888, 7 vessels, of a total tonnage of 688 tons. It has a fine inner and an outer harbour, and forms a convenient intermediate coaling station for vessels going round Cape Horn. There are 2 Government schools there, with 119 pupils, and 1 school of the Falkland Islands Company, at Darwin, with 80 pupils.

The climate is healthy. During the summer a calm day is unusual. The winds rise at about 10 a.m., and fall away again between 4 and 6 p.m. In winter the weather is less boisterous than in summer, and the thermometers seldom falls below 30°. The thermometer ranges from 30° to 50° in winter, and from 40° to 65° in summer. The average annual rainfall is 28-30 inches. The dryness of the atmosphere in summer is remarkable, and evaporation is rapid. The soil is chiefly peat, but near the surface, where the clay is of a lighter quality and mixed with vegetable remains, it is good soil fit for cultivation. Stone of two or three kinds suitable for building is found in different parts of the islands.

There is a great variety of sweet-scented flowers, which in November and December nearly cover the ground. The tussock grows to the height of seven feet, with a breadth of three-quarters of an inch, feeding on which the cattle get very fat. On all the small islands along the coast the tussock grass still abounds, but it has disappeared on the East
and West Falkland since cattle have been imported. Anti-scorbutics are very plentiful in a wild state, such as celery, scurvy grass, sorrel, &c., besides a small plant called the tea-plant, known and much used formerly by the sealers and Gauchos.

The main industry is sheep farming, and the export of sheep for breeding purposes to South America. Meat has lately been exported to England in refrigerators. There were in 1884 about 2,770 horses, 11,569 horned cattle, 473,227 sheep, and 1,002 goats on the islands, and in 1888, 2,173 horses, 8,169 horned cattle, 582,419 sheep, and 229 goats.

The other exports consist of wool, hides, horns, hoofs, bones, and tallow. The imports consist of textiles, alcohol, hardware, and general supplies.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling. There are no private banks in the Colony. A penny savings bank was established in 1885, in connection with the schools, and had, on 31st Dec., 1888, 481l. deposited; and on 1st April, 1888, a Government savings bank of the usual type was established, in which on 31st December, 1888, the deposits were 8,258l., belonging to 52 depositors.

The Falkland Islands Company.

This company was formed in 1851 to take over from Mr. Lafone, of Monte Video, the district in the East Falkland, now called Lafonia; this district abounded with wild cattle, the capture of which was the company's original object. This however was not found very profitable, and the company have of late years been engaged in sheep farming on an extensive scale, not only on their own freehold at Lafonia, but also on 108,684 acres leased from the Government, the importation of goods of all sorts, and the repairing of ships, many of which call at this port in distress. It is in a very flourishing condition, and has for several years past paid a dividend of fifteen per cent. Its capital is 100,000l., of which 95,000l. is paid up. The affairs of the company are directed in the islands by Mr. F. E. Cobb, and it maintains a doctor and a school at Darwin. The London office is at 39A, Gracechurch Street, E.C.

Means of Communication.

There is mail communication with England twelve times a year. The German "Kosmos" Steamer Company steamers call at Stanley on their voyage out to Callao six times a year, and six times on the return voyage. The voyage between Stanley and Dartmouth occupies five weeks. Mails for the Falkland Islands are also carried by the Pacific Company's Steamers, between Liverpool and Punta Arenas, in the Straits of Magellan, whence they are taken by the Kosmos Steamers to the Falkland Islands on their homeward voyage, and from the Falkland Islands to Punta Arenas on the outward voyage. Postage to Europe 1d. per ½ oz.; there is no internal post. The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Monte Video. There is a lighthouse at Cape Pembroke maintained by the Board of Trade at an annual cost of 600l.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council. The Legislative Council is composed of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Colonial Surgeon, and two unofficial members appointed by warrant under the Royal Sign Manual and Signet.

### FIJI

#### Situation and Area

The Colony of Fiji comprises the islands lying between latitude 15° and 22° S. and between longitude 171° West and 175° East. It is distant from Sydney about 1,900 miles, and from Auckland 1,200 miles. The Tongan or Friendly Islands lie 180 miles to the south-east, and Samoa 500 miles to the north-east. The French colony of New Caledonia lies to the westward about 700 miles. The number of islands has been variously stated at from 200 to 250; but this includes mere uninhabited rocks and islets.

The principal inhabited islands are Viti Levu, 4,112 square miles, Vanua Levu, 2,482 square miles, Taviuni, 217 square miles, Kadavu, 124 square miles, Koro, 58 square miles, Gau, 48 square miles, and Ovalau, 43 square miles. The total area of the Colony (including Rotumah, 14 square miles) is 7,435 square miles.

The more important islands are hilly and mountainous, rising more or less abruptly from the shore to a height of about 4,000 or even 4,500 feet. The hills are generally of a grand and picturesque outline, being composed for the most part of old volcanic lavas. Upon the south-eastern or windward sides the islands are covered with dense forests. The lower lands are more lightly timbered, and apparently have all been under cultivation at a not distant period when the native population was much larger. The soil is almost everywhere deep, easily worked, and especially rich in humic acid. The northern and north-western sides of the larger island, or leeward sides, are characterised by a comparative absence of forest lands. The hills or plains are covered with long reeds or grass, and dotted with clumps of Casuarina and Pandanus.

The country is well watered. Frequent rains keep alive the sources of the thousands of small affluents feeding the main rivers. Of these rivers, the Rewa stands first. It is navigable for boats, punts, or flat-bottomed steamers, for 40 or 50 miles from its mouth. Several large streams fall into it, the sources of which lie in the high mountains of the interior, 3,000 or 4,000 feet above the level of the sea. Besides these, the Sigatoka, the Nadi, and Ba rivers, with many others, drain the principal watersheds of Viti Levu. In Vanua Levu the rivers are not so large, though they are nearly as numerous. Almost every valley in the group has its stream or brook, from which the native occupants irrigate their plantations of "dalo" (*Calocasia esculenta*).

Fiji is as rich in harbours and roadsteads as it is in rivers. Each island is surrounded by a barrier reef, and, with few exceptions, is accessible through passages usually found opposite to the most considerable valley or river. Between this river and the shore ships lie safely at anchor, protected by an indestructible natural breakwater.

The Island of Rotumah, situated in 12° 30' S. lat., 177° 10' E. long., was discovered by the...
"Pandora" in 1793, when searching for the mutineers of the "Bounty." Lying to the north-west, from two to four miles from the shore, are three small islets, Hattana, Hofius, and Waya. Of these only the last named is inhabited, and it contains but one small village. In 1879 the three principal Rotumah chiefs offered the islands to Great Britain, and they were annexed 13th May, 1881. The population is estimated at 2,500, of whom four-fifths are Wesleyans, and the remainder Roman Catholics. The principal island is seven miles long by three miles broad, and contains about 9,000 acres.

Population.

The aboriginal population belongs to the darker of the two great Polynesian families, but, living on the confines of the fairer race, its blood has received some admixture. It was estimated in 1859 at 200,000; in 1868 at 170,000; and in 1874 at 140,000. By the epidemic of measles which occurred in 1875 it was again reduced. In 1888 the total population, including that of Rotumah, was estimated at 125,441, comprising 111,311 native Fijians, 6,489 Indian immigrants, and 2,115 Europeans, the remainder being mainly Polynesians, with a few half castes and Chinese; 100,000 are Wesleyans and 10,000 Roman Catholics.

History.

The islands were discovered by Tasman in 1643, and visited by Captain Cook in 1769. Captain Bligh, on his memorable voyage in the launch of the "Bounty," sighted part of the group in 1789. Missionaries settled there in 1835, and, after a time, met with great success.

In 1859 Thakombau, the most powerful chief of Fiji, offered the sovereignty of the islands to Great Britain. The offer was declined by the Duke of Newcastle in 1862. About that time the demand for cotton, owing to the American civil war, led to an influx of Europeans into Fiji for the purpose of cotton cultivation. In June, 1871, certain Englishmen set up a Fijian Government, with the principal chief, Thakombau, as king. A constitution was agreed upon, and a Parliament elected. The Parliament and the Government before long drifted into mutual hostility, and the Ministry latterly governed without the aid of the Parliament.

The question of annexing Fiji had been agitated both in Australia and England since 1869 on many grounds, and in August, 1878, the Earl of Kimberley commissioned Commodore Goodenough, commanding the squadron on the station, and Mr. E. L. Layard, Her Majesty's Consul in Fiji, to investigate and report on the matter. These commissioners, on the 21st of March, 1874, reported an offer of the cession of the sovereignty of the islands from the chiefs, with the assent of the Europeans, but on certain terms, which were not acceptable, and Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor of New South Wales, was despatched to Fiji in September, 1874, to negotiate. This mission was completely successful, and the sovereignty of the islands was ceded to Her Majesty by Thakombau, Maafu, and the other principal chiefs, in a deed of cession dated the 10th day of October, 1874. A charter was shortly afterwards issued by Her Majesty, erecting the islands into a separate colony, and providing for their government.

Climate.

The climate of Fiji is cool for the tropics, and the country is remarkably free from zymotic and enteric diseases. Dysentery is the only disease to which Europeans are peculiarly liable.

The highest shade temperature in 1888 was 92° in the month of March, and the lowest 63° in July and August. The total rainfall during the year was at Suva 112-45 inches. The rainfall extends over the whole year, but April to October is the driest period. Between December and April is the hurricane season.

Constitution.

The constitution is regulated by Letters Patent of 2nd Jan., 1875. The Executive Council consists of the Governor and three official members, and when sitting for the re-hearing of claims to land, under Ordinance No. 25 of 1879, consists of the ordinary members, with the Chief Justice, the Commissioner for Lands, and Mr. W. S. Carew.

The Legislative Council consists of six official and six non-official nominated members. To the natives a large share of self-government has been conceded, their system of village and district councils has been recognized and improved, and supplemented by an annual meeting of the high chiefs and representatives from each province, presided over by the Governor. The regulations recommended by these bodies have, however, to receive the sanction of the Legislative Council before acquiring the force of law.

Levuka, in the Island of Ovalau, with a population of 450 souls, was at first selected as the European capital, but during the year 1882 the seat of Government was transferred to Suva, on the south coast of the Island of Viti Levu, with a fine harbour. The white population of Suva exceeds 700. Both Suva and Levuka are ports of registry, and on 31st December, 1888, 14 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 632 tons.

A considerable portion of the revenue, varying from 15,000£. to 19,000£. net, is raised from taxation of the natives, as follows:

The Colony is divided into fourteen provinces (exclusive of Colo, the mountain district of Viti Levu), each under the control of a Roko Tui or chief native officer. Each province is sub-divided into districts, of which the head officers are termed Bulis. Once every year the provinces are severally assessed by the Legislative Council for a fixed amount of tax, to be delivered in the form of produce valued at the rate to be paid by the contractor for the year.

The Provincial Council, consisting of the Bulis, presided over by the Roko, distribute the provincial tax among the different districts, and there is then a further sub-division among the different villages by district councils, each presided over by its Buli. The amount and kind of produce paid by each province and district is recorded and should the total value in any case exceed the amount of assessment, the surplus is returned in the form of money.

The control of the department of native taxation is in the hands of the Receiver-General.

Local Government.

A municipality was established in 1887 in Levuka, and in 1882 one was established in Suva on the transfer of the seat of government. These boards are at present regulated by Ordinance No. 16 of 1883. The governing body in each town is elected by the ratepayers. Rates are collected on land and house property. General rates are limited to one shilling in the pound on the assessed value of rateable property; but special
rates not exceeding one shilling in the pound are further provided for.

The town board is also the school board in each town, and a rate of 6d. in the pound is paid for school purposes under Ordinance No. 37 of 1885.

A grant in aid not exceeding one-fifth of the sum raised by general rate in the preceding year may be paid from general revenue to any town board, and a grant not exceeding one-half of the amount required for specified expenses beyond the sum raised by school fees, to any school board.

The revenue and expenditure in 1888 was: Suva town board, £883l. 14s. 3d. and £958l. 8s.; ditto school board, £636l. 6s. 10d. and £621l. 18s. 3d.; Levuka town board, £899l. 8s. 2d., and £895l. 12s. 2d.; ditto school board, £589l. 3s. 8d., and £610l. 11s. 5d.

Total receipts of local authorities, £2,948l. 12s. 11½d.; total expenditure, £8,081l. 9s. 11½d., in addition to the revenue and expenditure of the native local districts above referred to.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency, and the only coin in circulation, is British sterling.

The following banks have branches in Fiji, viz.: The Bank of New Zealand (Suva and Levuka), and the Union Bank of Australasia, Ltd. (Suva), both of which issue notes.

Provision is made by Ordinance for the establishment of a Government savings bank, which will shortly be opened. There is no Government note issue. The Mortgage and Agency Co. of Australasia, Ltd., and The New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Co., Ltd., act as loan and mortgage companies.

Industries.

The chief products are sugar, copra, cotton, tea, maize, fruit, principally bananas, beche-de-mer, and peanuts. The export of sugar in 1888 was 16,916 tons, from an area of 12,250 acres; of copra 4,219 tons, from an area of 19,393 acres; cotton 3 tons, from 305 acres; tea over 13 tons, from 305 acres; maize 12,968 bushels, fruit to the value of 42,448l., 62 tons of beche-de-mer, and 346 tons of peanuts. Eighty per cent. of the trade is with the Australian Colonies; there are 12 sugar mills and 2 fruit preserving establishments.

Education.

A government system of elementary education is established under the Public Schools Ordinance of 1882. The management is vested in elected school boards. There are two common schools, with head and assistant teachers: Suva, 103 scholars; Levuka, 73 scholars. These common schools receive a grant in aid from the public revenues.

The Public Schools Ordinance also provides for the establishment of high schools for advanced education.

There is a Government industrial school for native youths on Vanua Levu, attended by 64 scholars, which is partially self-supporting. The Wesleyan and Roman Catholic Missions provide for the education of the natives everywhere throughout the group.

Wesleyan schools, 1,824, native teachers, 2,517, scholars, 41,077.

Roman Catholic schools 84, scholars 1,040. Day School (for New Hebrides people), 1, scholars 63.

Means of Communication.

There is regular steam communication with the following places outside the colony: Sydney, (8 days). Melbourne (10 days), Auckland (4 days), New Caledonia (3 days), Tonga (2 days).

Postage to the United Kingdom, via San Francisco or Brindisi, 8d. per ½ oz.; to the Australian Colonies and New Zealand, 2d. per ½ oz. Internal postal rates: town 1d., country 2d. per ½ oz.; newspapers 1d. to the United Kingdom, via San Francisco, to the Australasian Colonies and Pacific Islands; to all other places 2d.

There is no railway or telegraph in the colony. The nearest points in telegraphic communication with Europe are Auckland (N.Z.) and Sydney, (N.S.W.). Intercommunication is maintained by sailing boats and steam launches, and by an interinsular steamer. A few good roads have been constructed on the larger islands.
