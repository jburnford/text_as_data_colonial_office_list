GIBRALTAR.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of Gibraltar consists of an elevated promontory, running southwards from the southwest coast of Spain, in N. lat 36° 6' 80", and W. long. 5° 21' 12". Its greatest elevation is 1,439 feet, its length is 2½ miles, and its greatest breadth ¾ of a mile. Its area is 1½ square miles.

History.

The rock of Gibraltar, the Mons Calpe of the ancients, remained under the dominion of the
Moors until the 15th century, when it was incorporated with the Spanish kingdom of Granada. It was captured by the British forces under Sir George Rooke, 24th July, 1704, and was ceded by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. It was successfully defended by Gen. Eliot (afterwards Lord Heathfield) in the great siege of 1779-1783.

General Description.

The promontory forms one side of a bay, called the Bay of Gibraltar, which is about 4 or 5 miles across, and affords good anchorage for the shipping passing through the straits. The eastern face of the Rock is an inaccessible precipice. The larger portion of the town lies on the northern portion of the west slope of the Rock. It is one of the most thickly inhabited places in the world, but it is very healthy, and the drainage and water supply are good. The two portions of the town are separated by a picturesque public garden, called the Alameda.

Gibraltar is extensively used as a port of call and coaling station by shipping, and it is also an entrepôt of the trade between England and the Arabian states of Northern Africa, for which it has many advantages, having been ever since its occupation by the British a free port. About 600 persons are employed in the 42 tobacco manufactories, and about 1,200 in the coal depots. It is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1888, 39 vessels, of together 9,444 tons. No statistics of imports or exports are taken, but in 1888 the exports from England to Gibraltar were 763,408l., and the imports 149,119l.

The revenue is derived from port dues, the rent of the Crown estate in the town, duties upon wine, spirits, and beer, and a few licence duties.

The customs tariff (home consumption) is as follows:

(Ordinance 9th Sept., 1884, and 1st July, 1886.)

| Pesetas. cents. |
|----------------|
| Wine in wood, per gall. | 0 40 |
| Wine in bottles, per doz. | 1 25 |
| Spirits, per proof gall., and cordials or liqueurs, per gall. | 5 0 |
| Malt liquor, per gall. | 0 05 |

The total revenue from customs in 1888 was 281,981 pesetas.

There is no executive council nor any legislative body; the Governor, who is also the General commanding the garrison, exercising by himself all the functions of government and legislation. The management of the drainage, water supply, &c., is in the hands of a partly elected and partly nominated body, called the Sanitary Commissioners. Their receipts for 1888 were 636,759 pesetas, and their expenditure 1,028,525 pesetas, and their debt on the 31st of Dec., 1887, 1,402,075 pesetas.

There is a branch of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank, which has taken over the business of the late Mr. J. Saccone.

A Government savings bank was founded in 1882, and had on 31st Dec., 1888, 1,357,933 pesas deposited by 1,731 depositors. The legal tender currency is that of Spain, and public accounts are kept in it: (1 peseta = 1 franc, approximately).

There is daily postal communication with England by way of Spain and France: rates of postage, letters, 25 c. per ½ oz., newspapers 10 c. The internal post rate is 10 c. per ¼ oz. There are also branch post offices worked by the Gibraltar postal administration at Tangier, Larache, Rabat, and Casablanca, Saffi, Mazagan and Mogador in Morocco, and direct telegraphic communication with Spain, and by cables to Tangier, Malta, Lisbon, and Cadiz.

Education is not compulsory. There are fourteen elementary poor schools subsidised by Government, the number of scholars on the rolls being 3,103. The schools are managed by the clergy of the different denominations, and small fees are charged.

Defence.

As an important naval station, Gibraltar is strongly fortified, the whole area forming one large citadel. There is a permanent garrison of about 5,300 men. The permanent naval establishment numbers about 220 men.
