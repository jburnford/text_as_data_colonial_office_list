JAMAICA.

Situation and Area.

Jamaica is an island in the Caribbean Sea, to the southward of the eastern extremity of the Island of Cuba, within N. lat. 17° 43' and 18° 32', and W. long. 76° 10' and 78° 20'. It is the largest of the British West Indies, being 144 miles in length, and 50 in extreme breadth, and containing about 4,193 square miles.

The Cayman Islands, lying between 19° 10' and 19° 45' N. lat., and 79° 30' and 80° 35' W. long., are dependencies of Jamaica. The largest of the islands, Grand Cayman, contains about 2,000
inhabitants, who as well as the inhabitants of the other two, Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, are mainly engaged in catching turtle for export. Pedro and Morant Cays are also dependencies, being two guano islands in 17° N. lat., as well as the Turks and Caicos Islands. (See p. 253.)

It is estimated that Jamaica contains 2,683,520 acres, from which may be deducted 365,828 acres as useless for agriculture, consisting chiefly of swamps, rocks, and inaccessible lands, leaving 2,317,692 acres available for cultivation. Of this 616,504 acres are returned as under cultivation in 1888. The dependencies have an area of 89 miles.

History.

Jamaica was discovered by Columbus on the 3rd May, 1494. He called it St. Jago. It remained in the possession of the Spaniards for 161 years, when it was attacked by a force sent by Cromwell, under Admirals Penn and Venables, against Hispaniola, and capitulated, after a trifling resistance, on the 3rd May, 1655. Until the Restoration, Jamaica remained under military jurisdiction, but in 1660 a regular civil government was established by Charles II, who appointed G. D'Oyley Governor-in-Chief, with an Elective Council. In 1670 peace was made with Spain, and the title of England to Jamaica was recognized by the Treaty of Madrid. When the Slave Trade was abolished, in 1807, there were 323,827 slaves in Jamaica. During the last eight years of the trade, 86,821 slaves were imported. On the abolition of slavery in 1833, Jamaica received 6,161,927l. of the 20,000,000l. granted by the Imperial Government as compensation to the slaveowners. A serious rebellion among the black population in 1865 was suppressed by Governor Eyre with unnecessary violence, and he was recalled.

Climate and Inhabitants.

There is great variety of climate; the mean temperature of Kingston is about 80°, rising to 90° in the daytime, and falling to 70° at night. As the temperature falls about 1° for every 300 feet of ascent, and as there is a lofty range of mountains which run down the middle of the whole island, it is possible, in a few hours, to reach a cool and delightful climate. From Kingston, the capital, a change of 10° or 15° in temperature can be attained by a ride of three hours.

The rainy seasons are in May and October, and last for about three weeks; but besides these heavy and periodical rainfalls, the ground is refreshed by continual showers. The annual rainfall varies throughout the island from about 30 inches to as much as 180 inches.

Only two per cent. of the inhabitants are white; the remainder are chiefly of African descent, four-fifths being pure negroes. There are about 12,000 imported coolies. English is universally spoken.

Constitution.

The original Constitution, which, after existing for nearly 200 years, was surrendered in 1866, was a representative one, consisting of a Governor, a Privy Council, a Legislative Council, and an Assembly of 47 elected members.

After the suppression of the rebellion in 1865, Governor Eyre, at the meeting of the Legislature, urged the unsuitability of the then existing form of Government to meet the circumstances of the community, and the necessity of making some sweeping change, by which a strong Government might be created. The Legislature willingly responded, abrogated all the existing machinery of legislation, and left it to Her Majesty's Government to substitute any other form of Government which might be better suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony.

A Legislative Council was, by Orders in Council of the 11th June, 1866, and 11th November, 1869, established, consisting of such numbers of official and unofficial members as Her Majesty might think fit. The numbers of each were six until 1878, when they were enlarged to eight, and a ninth was added in 1881.

By Order in Council dated 19th May, 1884, the constitution was fixed in the following manner:

The Council to consist of the Governor and four ex officio members, viz.: the Senior Military Officer, the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General and Director of Public Works, and such other persons not exceeding five in number as Her Majesty may from time to time appoint, or as the Governor may from time to time provisionally appoint, and nine persons to be elected as therein provided. The Council shall be dissolved at the end of five years from the last preceding general election, if it shall not have been previously dissolved.

There is also a Privy Council, with the usual powers and functions of an executive council. It consists of the Lieutenant-Governor, if any, the Senior Military Officer in command, the Colonial Secretary, and Attorney-General, and such other persons, not to exceed eight in number, as may be named by the Queen, or provisionally appointed by the Governor subject to the approval of Her Majesty. The Governor is to preside at each meeting, and the Governor and two members form a quorum.

Local Administration.

There are elective Parochial Boards in the town of Kingston and 13 other parishes, under Law 16 of 1885, with jurisdiction over roads, markets, sanitation, poor relief, water works, and pounds. The chief towns are Kingston (population 38,566), Port Royal (population 1,200), Spanish Town (population 5,689), Montego Bay (population 4,651), Falmouth (population 3,029), and Port Maria (population 6,741).

The number of parishes (which are the units of local government) has been reduced from 22 to 14. Each parish has its own parochial institutions, viz., almshouses, &c., &c., managed by the Parochial Board of the parish, the members of which are elected by the persons entitled to vote for the election of members of the Legislative Council. The several direct taxes received on land, houses, horses, carriages, &c., &c., are devoted entirely to the parish in which they are collected.

The total revenue of all the local bodies in 1888 was 128,818l.; their expenditure 148,631l., and their debt at the end of the year 174,441l.

There is a High Court of Justice, and Petty Sessions of magistrates throughout the island. The Resident Magistrates, besides holding courts of their own, preside in the Courts of Petty Sessions.

An "island medical service," under the control of a superintending medical officer, was established in 1870. The several medical practitioners, who receive a retaining fee or salary from the Government, are designated "district medical officers." They are located throughout the island, and for the fixed salary paid by Government they have to attend sick paupers, parochial hospitals and almshouses, the constabulary officers and men, and prisons.
The Colonial revenue is derived mainly from import duties on food stuffs, alcohol, and an ad valorem duty; the excise on rum (80,000l.), and stamps and licences. There is no direct taxation except that of the local boards, and the total of the direct taxes on land is less than 12,000l.

Defence.

The constabulary was placed on its present footing in 1867, and is modelled on the system of the Royal Irish Constabulary, and "partially under military organisation and discipline." There are 18 officers (inspectors and sub-inspectors), under an Inspector-General, and 693 sub-officers and men, distributed throughout the island.

There is an Imperial garrison of 950 men, stationed near Kingston, and a naval station at Port Royal. There is a volunteer militia force numbering 600 officers and men.

Currency and Banking.

British currency, United States gold, and gold doubloons are legal tender. Accounts are kept in sterling, and the coin in circulation is almost exclusively British silver and Jamaica nickel pence. Total estimated coin 360,000l. The Colonial Bank is the only private banking establishment in the Colony (1 branch and 4 agencies); it has a note circulation estimated at 125,000l. The limit to which silver is legal tender is 5l.

Government savings banks were instituted in all the principal towns in 1871, the rate of interest allowed being at first 4 per cent., but this was reduced in 1881 to 3 per cent. The total deposits on 30th September, 1888, were 394,553l.

Education.

Elementary education is left to private enterprise, aided, since 1867, by a system of grants in aid from the Colonial revenue. The number of schools is 771, with 71,643 scholars, and the grant in aid for 1888 was 24,894l.; small fees are charged. The Government maintains a system of inspection, and has provided two training colleges, for male and female teachers respectively, which are wholly supported from public funds. No provision is made from public funds for secondary or technical education, but there are some endowed schools and scholarships tenable at the English universities.

Industry.

Fruit, consisting of oranges, citron, bananas, &c., is now one of the largest exports, the output of oranges in 1888 being 47,910,177. The total export now exceeds 300,000l.

The other chief crops are sugar, coffee, ginger, and pimento, and the exports comprise, in addition to those products, rum, dyewoods, cocoa, &c. The area under sugar in 1888 was 18,779 acres, and under coffee 33,431. There are 150 acres of Government cinchona plantations. The chief imports are food stuffs, clothing, hardware, alcohol, and building materials. Of the whole trade, 51 per cent. is with the United Kingdom, and 35 per cent. with the United States, the next most important country being Canada.

Means of Communication.

There is a regular postal service throughout the island, daily between some places, and elsewhere three times per week, by means of mail coaches.

The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters | Newspapers |
|---------|-----------|
| Internal: Kingston, Spanish Town, and other places within daily limit, per ½oz. | 1d. each. |
| Ditto, elsewhere | 2½d. each. |
| To Postal Union and Australasia | 4½d. each. |
| Hayti ... | 2½d. each. |
| Africa ... | 9½d. each. |
| China ... | 8½d. each. |

Parcels post with England, 9d. per lb.; with United States and British W.I. Colonies, 6d. per lb.

There is regular and frequent communication between Europe and Jamaica. The Royal Mail contract steamers leave Southampton on every alternate Thursday throughout the year. The average passage is 17 days. The Royal Mail cargo steamers leave Southampton on 11th and 23rd of the month. The West India and Pacific steamers leave Liverpool on the 10th of each month, their average passage being 21 days. There is also frequent steam communication between the United States and Jamaica.

Telegraphic communication with Europe is complete. Jamaica is the first British possession in the West Indies which the two cables from Cuba touch at, whence they branch away via St. Thomas, to Demerara, and in the opposite direction to the Isthmus of Panama.

A line of inland telegraph, connecting all the principal towns, and having 46 stations, is now in operation. The total mileage open is 664. The total cost of the telegraphs has been 15,802l. 0s. 5d. The receipts in 1888 were 4,447l., and the expenses 4,212l.

The Government Railway extends from Kingston to Porus, in the parish of Manchester, in one direction, a distance of 47 miles, and to Ewarton, in the parish of St. Catherine, in the other direction, by a branch line from Spanish Town of 17 miles. The total length of line open is 64 miles, constructed at a cost of 775,000l. The railway receipts in 1888 were 55,646l., and the expenses 34,356l.

A weekly steam communication round the island to the principal outports has been established. The circuit is completed within 120 hours.
