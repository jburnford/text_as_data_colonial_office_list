TRINIDAD.

Situation and Area.

The island of Trinidad lies about 16 miles to the eastward of Venezuela, between 10° 3' and 10° 50' N. latitude, and 61° 39' and 62° W. longitude from Greenwich. Its area is 1,754 square miles. It is separated from the continent of America by the Gulf of Paria, into which fall the northern mouths of the Orinoco. The Colony now includes Tobago (formerly in the Windward Islands), which was amalgamated with Trinidad by an Order in Council under the Act 50 and 51 Vic., c. 44, on 1st Jan., 1889.

History.

Trinidad was first discovered by Columbus, on his third voyage, on the 31st July, 1496; and taken possession of by him for the Crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the king of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island.

Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of the representations made to the Court of Madrid by M. Rome de St. Laurent, a French planter of Grenada, who, when on a visit to the island, had been struck by its extraordinary fertility, a Royal cedula or proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to foreigners of all nations to settle in Trinidad, the sole condition imposed, and that not very strictly insisted upon, being that they should profess the Roman Catholic religion. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, which was soon augmented by many French families, who were driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere, by the terrible events of the French Revolution, and to this cause is to be traced the preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

On the 12th February, 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad. The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces, and on the 1st February, 1797, the articles of capitulation were signed by Sir R. Abercrombie, Admiral Harvey, and Chacou, the Spanish governor.

In 1802 it was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

The population of the colony is composed of English, French, Spanish, and a large proportion of East Indian immigrants. The French lower classes speak a patois peculiar to the West Indies.

General Description.

The soil is varied, extremely fertile, and excellently adapted to the growth of tropical products, more particularly of sugar and cacao, which are its staples. Coffee has of late been largely cultivated, and with great success, bidding fair to become a very considerable factor in the future exporting power of the Colony. Tobacco of a superior quality is also largely grown. Molasses, rum, bitters, coconuts, and asphalt, are also exported.

The chief imports are textiles, flour, and rice, dried fish and meat, hardware, machinery, and lumber. Gold is imported from Venezuela to the extent of about a million sterling annually, and reshipped to Europe. A little more than a third and a fourth of the whole trade of the Colony is with the United Kingdom and the United States of America respectively.

The climate of Trinidad is healthy, and by no means hurtful to Europeans, provided they take reasonable precautions. The average rainfall for the past 25 years has been 65-49 inches. The mean temperature during the year 1888 was 78°6 Fahr., the mean maximum being 87°3, and the mean minimum 69°7.

The chief town and principal port of Trinidad is Port of Spain (population in 1881, 31,858), situated on a gently inclined plain, near the northeast angle of the Gulf of Paria. It is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1888, 529 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 7,757. Four miles of tramway and 450 miles of telephone have been constructed in Port of Spain.

The next town and port is San Fernando (population in 1881, 6,835), about 30 miles south from Port of Spain.

Both these towns possess elective municipal councils and mayors. The municipal revenue of Port of Spain was in 1888 17,092l., and the expenditure 11,628l. That of San Fernando was 5,756l. and 5,739l. respectively. The chief source of revenue in both boroughs is a rate on property.

A charter of incorporation has lately been granted to Arima, an inland town about 16 miles from Port of Spain, with some 8,000 inhabitants.

A pitch lake, 109 to 114 acres in extent, is situated in the ward of La Brea, distant by water about 30 miles from Port of Spain; it is of considerable value, and has been leased to an American Company, the terms being that the Company is not to pay less than 10,000l. in any one year in royalties and export duties. The lease is for 21 years from 1st January, 1888.

Of the total area of Trinidad, which is estimated at about 1,120,000 acres, the alienated acreage at the end of 1888 was 388,651 acres.

Means of Communication.

Communication between Port of Spain and San Fernando is maintained by means of the Gulf
steamer, which ply three times a week, and by
the railway. The Gulf steamers proceed as far as
Cedros, in the south-western part of the island, a
total distance of sixty miles from Port of Spain.

The railway from Port of Spain to Arima (16
miles) was opened in 1876. The Couva line (18
miles from the junction at St. Joseph, 24 miles
in all from Port of Spain) was opened in 1880.
An extension of 44 miles was opened to Claxton's
Bay on 1st January, 1881, the extension to San
Fernando (7 miles), on the 17th April, 1882, and
that to Princess Town in 1884. There are also 7
miles of tramways or light railways between San
Fernando and Savana Grande, and a short line at
Chaguaramas, used chiefly for the conveyance of
sugar. The total length of line open is 544 miles,
all constructed and worked by the Government.
The total cost of the railways has been 602,638£;
the receipts during 1888 were 54,980£, and the
expenditure 23,098£. This last amount does not
include the annual appropriation for interest and
sinking fund, which in 1888 was 34,463£.

There is a General Post Office in Port of Spain,
a branch office at San Fernando, and 44 out offices
throughout the island.

There is direct telegraphic communication with
British Guiana, Grenada, and Saint Croix, and
thence, viz the United States, with Europe. The
internal telegraphs now comprise 63 miles, con-
structed by the Government at a total cost of
3,150£. The receipts in 1888 were 458£, and the
expenses 922£.

The number of steamers calling at Trinidad has
within the last few years increased considerably,
the number per month being now 35, viz, 4 royal
mail steamers, 2 royal mail cargo steamers, 4 of the
steamers of the Compagnie Generale Transatlantique,
4 of the West India and Pacific Line, one of the Har-
rison Line, and 2 of Joseph Hoults Line, from
Liverpool; 4 of the London Direct Line steamers,
1 Clyde steamer, 2 of the Quebec and Gulf Line,
and 2 of the Atlantic and West India Line from
America, 2 Dutch line, and 7 steamers running
between the island and Venezuela. A fortnightly
service to New York in connection with the fruit
trade has been started by a local firm for a yearly
subsidy of 5,000£. Mails are regularly forwarded
and received by all these steamers. The rates of
postage are as follows per ½ oz. letter:

| Distance          | Rate (£) |
|-------------------|----------|
| Within Colony     | 1        |
| Beyond 300 miles  | 2½       |

Coolie Immigration.

Immigration from India is conducted under
Government control. Under this head 14,185£,
was expended by the Government in 1888, i.e.,
three tenths of the total expenditure, exclusive of
the fixed establishment of the department, the cost
of which is about 3,562£. The number of Indian
immigrants during each of the last three years was
as follows:

| Year | Number |
|------|--------|
| 1886 | 2,185  |
| 1887 | 2,179  |
| 1888 | 1,860  |

Currency and Banking.

The coins in general circulation are British silver
and bronze, United States gold currency, and
gold doubloons. These are all legal tender, as is
also British gold, which is not often met with.
Accounts are kept in sterling by the Government,
but in dollars by the public. The notes of the
Colonial Bank circulate to the extent of 130,000£.
There is no Colonial coinage or note issue.
There is no limit to silver as legal tender.
The Colonial Bank has branches at Port of
Spain and San Fernando. Government savings
banks are established in ten districts. The balance
in these banks at the end of 1888 was 122,754£.
They are under the management of the Receiver-
General and the local wardens.

Defence.

A volunteer rifle corps was established in Port
of Spain in 1879. It now numbers over 300. A
volunteer artillery corps at Port of Spain, mounted
infantry corps at Naparima and Couva, and a rifle
corps at San Fernando, are now being enrolled.
The police force consists of 435 men.

Education.

The schools are of two kinds, one secular, and
supported entirely by Government, the other de-
nominalional, aided only by the Government.
For higher education there are the Queen's Royal
College (secular), and its affiliated Roman Catholic
institution, the College of the Immaculate Con-
ception. Attached to these institutions are four
exhibitions or scholarships of the annual value of
150£, each tenable for three years at some uni-
versity or other scientific educational institution
in the British Empire. There were at the end of
1888 65 students on the books of the Queen's Royal
College, and 168 on those of the College of the
Immaculate Conception.

From the Government primary schools to the
Queen's Royal College there are annually open to
competition three free admissions, each tenable for
three years.

The primary schools are now 158 in number,
77 of which are secular schools supported entirely
by Government, and 81 denominational and
assisted. The Government schools are generally
well supplied with school requisites; their furni-
ture is constructed on good models, and some
of them are held in creditable buildings. Fees are
exact ed, the usual rates being threepence per head
per week; at some schools the charge is two
shillings per month, and at the Model Schools five
shillings per month. There is a reduction when
the fees are paid quarterly in advance, and reduced
rates are charged for the second and third children
in a family. In connection with the Model
Schools there are Training Colleges for male and
female teachers, which admit twelve resident and
seven non-resident students. The staff of the
Government schools includes 57 masters, 15 mis-
tresses, 15 assistant masters, 77 assistant and work
mistresses, and 86 pupil teachers, paid monitors,
and normal students.

The number of pupils attending the primary
schools was as follows:

| Year | Government Schools | Assisted Schools | Total |
|------|--------------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1884 | 3,904              | 5,182           | 9,086 |
| 1885 | 4,911              | 5,511           | 10,422|
| 1886 | 4,212              | 6,315           | 10,527|
| 1887 | 6,277              | 7,299           | 13,576|
| 1888 | 7,214              | 8,256           | 15,470|

Besides the public schools of which mention has
been made above, there are many private adventure
schools, the largest of which is the Convent Board-
ing and Day School for girls. Under the Presby-
terian Coolie Mission there are 15 estate
schools, having about 583 pupils; so that it may be
roughly estimated that the number of children
attending school in Trinidad is about 16,000.
Government.

The Government is administered by a Governor, with an executive council of three members. The legislative body is a Council, including the Governor, who is President, 7 official, and 9 unofficial members, all of whom are appointed by the Crown.
