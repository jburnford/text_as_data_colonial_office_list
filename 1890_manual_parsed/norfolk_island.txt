NORFOLK ISLAND.

Norfolk Island is the principal of a small group of islands lying 900 miles E.N.E. of Sydney, in 29° 2' S. lat. and 167° 48' E. long., the chief other islets being Philip, Nepean, and Bird Islands. They comprise altogether about 12 square miles, and were discovered in 1774 by Capt. Cook. They remained uninhabited until 1788, when a penal settlement was formed there from Botany Bay. This was removed in 1855, and in 1856 the inhabitants of Pitcairn Island were brought to the group, about 150 persons settling there, with their cattle, sheep, and pigs. The group has since been made a depot of the Melanesian Mission of the S.P.G., and the total population on 31st December,
1887, was 741. The chief occupation is agriculture for domestic consumption, but the men take part in the whale fishery.

There is but little regular administration, but the community is presided over by two of the leading inhabitants as unpaid magistrates, the elder being Stephen Christian, with a simple code of laws. The community is under the superintendence of the Governor of New South Wales, and is visited occasionally by him, and by the magistrate of Lord Howe Island; but it does not form part of the Colony. Communication with the group is now maintained by a sailing vessel once in every three months, subsidized by the Imperial Government. There is a resident doctor, and an efficient school. The chief village is Kington, on the largest island.
