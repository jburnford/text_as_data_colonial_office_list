STRAITS SETTLEMENTS.

The Straits Settlements, which comprise Singapore, Penang, and Malacca, were transferred from the control of the Indian Government to that of the Secretary of State for the Colonies on the 1st April, 1867, by an Order in Council issued under the authority of an Act of the Imperial Parliament 29 & 30 Vict. c. 115.

Situation and Area.

Singapore is an island about 27 miles long by 14 wide, containing an area of 206 square miles, situated at the southern extremity of the Malayan Peninsula, from which it is separated by a narrow strait about three-quarters of a mile in width. There are a number of small islands adjacent to it which form part of the settlement.

The seat of Government is the town of Singapore, at the southern point of the island, in lat. 1° 16' north, and long. 108° 53' east.

Penang is an island about 15 miles long and 9 broad, containing an area of 107 square miles, situated off the west coast of the Malayan Peninsula in 5° N. latitude, and at the northern extremity or entrance to the Straits of Malacca. On the opposite shore of the main land, from which the island is separated by a strait from 2 to 10 miles broad, is Province Wellesley, a strip of territory forming part of the settlement, averaging 8 miles in width, and extending 45 miles along the coast, including 10 miles of territory to the south of the Krian (vide infra), the whole containing an area of 270 square miles.

The chief town is George Town, in 5° 24' north lat. and 100° 21' east long.

Malacca is situated on the western coast of the peninsula between Singapore and Penang, about 110 miles from the former and 240 from the latter and consists of a strip of territory about 42 miles in length, and from 8 to 26 miles in breadth, containing an area of 659 square miles. The town, called Malacca, is in 2° 10' north lat. and 102° 14' east long.

The Dindings, area 200 square miles, two-thirds forest, include the island of Pangkor and a strip of territory opposite on the mainland, about 80 miles from Penang, in 4° 15' north lat. and 100° 35' east long. The Cocos or Keeling Islands, taken possession of by the British in 1857, were placed, by letters patent of 13th October, 1878, under Ceylon, and by Letters Patent dated the 1st of February, 1886, under the Government of the Straits Settlements. They lie between lat. 11° 50' to 12° 45' S., long. 96° 50' E., 700 miles W.S. of Batavia. The largest is 5 miles by ½ mile. There are large coconut plantations.

Christmas Island, situated in the Indian Ocean, lat. 10° 30' S., long. 105° 40' E., annexed in July, 1888, was placed under the administration of the Governor of the Straits Settlements by Letters Patent of 8th Jan., 1889.

History.

Malacca, known as an important independent state from the oldest times, is one of the oldest European settlements in the East, having been taken possession of by the Portuguese under Albuquerque in 1511, and held by them till 1641, when the Dutch, after frequent attempts, were suc-
cessful in driving them out. The settlement remained under the Government of the Dutch till 1795 when it was taken possession of by the English and held by them till 1818, at which date it was restored to the Dutch, and finally passed into our hands in pursuance of the treaty with Holland the 17th March, 1824, in exchange for the East India Company's settlement at Bengoolen, on the west coast of Sumatra. By that treaty it was arranged that the Dutch should leave the Malay Peninsula, the British Government agreeing at the same time to leave Sumatra to the Dutch.

When Malacca was taken possession of by the Portuguese in 1511, it was one of the grand entrepôts for the commerce of the East, but as the Portuguese pushed their operations further to the east, in the archipelago and neighbouring countries, the trade of Malacca gradually declined, and it ceased to be of consequence as a collecting centre except for the trade of the Malayan Peninsula and the Island of Sumatra, which trade it retained, under Dutch rule, till the establishment of Penang in 1786, when in the course of a few years trade almost ceased, and it became, what it has ever since been, a place of little commercial importance, but possessing great agricultural resources. Penang soon acquired a monopoly of the trade of the Malayan Peninsula and Sumatra, and had a large traffic with China, Siam, Borneo, the Celebes, and other places in the archipelago not reduced to mercantile subjection by the Dutch; but no sooner was Singapore established than Penang in its turn had to yield the first place to Singapore, and came to depend chiefly on the local trade, which has largely increased in consequence of the opening out of the extensive tin mines in Larut, Klang, Selangor, and Junk Ceylon, and the settling of Deli, on the coast of Sumatra.

Penang, or Prince of Wales' Island as it is officially called, was the first British settlement on the Malayan Peninsula, having been ceded to the English by the Raja of Kedah in 1785, with the proviso that the sum of 6,000 dols. be annually paid to the Raja of Kedah as long as the British occupy the island. In 1798, in consequence of the prevalence of piracy on the shores of the mainland opposite Penang, a strip of the coast of the mainland was acquired from the Raja, now called Province Wellesley. This has been subsequently enlarged from time to time, until it now extends from the Muda River to 10 miles south of the Krian River, a distance of 45 miles, containing in all 270 square miles. This province is in a high state of cultivation, the chief articles cultivated being sugar, paddy, and coconuts. In 1805 Penang was made a separate Presidency under the East India Company, of equal rank with Madras and Bombay. In 1826 Singapore and Malacca were incorporated with it under one government, Penang still remaining the seat of government. In 1830 the seat of government was transferred to Singapore.

There is some evidence of Singapore having been an important trading centre in the 12th and 13th centuries, and the tradition is that the place was attacked and devastated in 1252 by the Javanese. Thenceforth the island was scarcely inhabited until it was taken possession of by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819, by virtue of a treaty with the Johor princes. It was at first subordinate to Bengoolen (Fort Marlborough) in Sumatra, but in 1823 it was placed under the Government of Bengal; it was afterwards, as above stated, incorporated with Penang and Malacca, and placed under the Governor and Council of the Incorporated Settlements.

Native States.

The anarchy prevailing in some states of the Malayan Peninsula, and especially in Perak, was for years a source of disquiet to the Straits Settlements community, and a hindrance to the prosperity of British traders. In the beginning of 1874, under the instructions of the Secretary of State, steps were taken by Sir A. Clarke to remedy this state of things by stationing British residents in Perak and Selangor, and in the small state of Sungei Ujong, to advise their rulers respecting the collection of revenue and general administration. With a view also of enabling the British Authorities to keep order in that part of the Peninsula, a strip of land south of Province Wellesley, about 10 miles broad, beyond the Krian river, has been acquired as British Territory, as well as the territory known as The Dindings, consisting of the island of Pulau Pangkor and a small portion of the mainland opposite.

Towards the end of 1875 disturbances arose in these States, Mr. J. W. W. Birch, the British Resident at Perak, was murdered, a force sent to apprehend the murderers was resisted; and the Residency in Sungei Ujong was menaced by bodies of Malays from some of the States near Malacca.

Under the prompt and energetic measures taken by the Governor, Sir W. Jervois, these outbreaks were suppressed in the course of about two months.

After the military occupation of Perak, those concerned in the murder of Mr. Birch were captured and punished, some of the chiefs being banished to the Seychelles. In Perak, Selangor, and Sungei Ujong, including Jelebu, Residents have been appointed, who are assisted by a staff of European officers, and it is their duty to aid the native rulers by advice, and to carry out executive functions. The supreme authority in each state is vested in the State Council, consisting of the highest native authorities and the principal English officials. The Residents are directly under the Governor of the Straits Settlements. Perak lies between 8° 44' and 50° 29' N. lat., and 100° 22' and 101° 40' E. long. It comprises 7,949 square miles, with hills rising to 8,000 feet. Selangor is 3,000 square miles, and Sungei Ujong 660 square miles in area.

Licences and customs, of which latter the duty on the export of tin is the most important, form the revenue of these States. The country, however, is otherwise rich, and offers great advantages for the cultivation of coffee, cinchona, tea, &c., on its high lands, and of paddy in the valleys. Since the war the increase among the Chinese has been very great.

Sir F. Weld in 1883 consolidated the relations of the Colony with the native states on the frontier of Malacca, Johol, Inas or Jelei, Ulu Muar or Sri Menanti, Jempol, and Rembau. These states were confederated in 1889 by an agreement, arranged by Sir C. C. Smith, under the name of the Negri Sembilan. A State Council has been formed, and a Resident has been appointed, who is stationed at Kwala Pilah, a rising town on the River Muar, and the centre of a thriving tin mining industry.

In 1887, Sir F. Weld made an agreement with the Raja of Pahang, in accordance with which the control of his foreign relations, &c., were surrendered to the British Government. This was followed by a further agreement in 1888, between
the Raja (now styled Sultan) and Governor Sir C. C. Smith, under which Pahang was taken under British protection on the same terms as the Protected Native States on the west coast of the Peninsula. Pahang is situated on the east coast, within 200 miles by sea from Singapore. The total area is not much less than 15,000 square miles, and the Pahang River is navigable for steam-launches to a distance of 200 miles from its mouth. The population is estimated at about 35,000, chiefly Malays. The state is rich in gold, tin, and galena. Several British companies have been formed for the development of its mineral resources.

In addition to the above states, the Sultan of Johor in 1887 placed, in the spirit of former treaties, his foreign relations in the hands of this country, and has agreed to receive a British Agent.

The finance and trade of the states in 1888 were as follows:

| Revenue | Expenditure |
|---------|-------------|
| Péraí   | $2,539,708  |
| Selangor| 1,505,652   |
| Sungei Ujong | 263,273 |

Sungei Ujong, $89,855.

Constitution, Law, and Justice.

The government consists of a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council. The latter body consists of 10 official members and 7 unofficial members, of whom two are nominated by the Chambers of Commerce of Singapore and Penang.

The law in force is contained in local ordinances, and in such English and Indian Acts and Orders in Council as have been made applicable to the colony. The Indian Penal Code, with slight alterations, has been adopted, and there is a Civil Procedure Code based on the English Judicature Acts.

There is a Supreme Court which holds assizes at Singapore and Penang every two months, and quarterly at Malacca; and which holds civil sittings, monthly at Singapore and Penang, and once or twice a quarter at Malacca.

Defence.

Singapore harbour is defended by batteries just completed, to be armed with heavy ordnance. The military force consists of two garrison batteries of the Royal Artillery, one battalion of an infantry regiment and a company of the Eastern Battalion Royal Engineers (Malay Submarine Miners). There are also a few men of the China Gun Lascars (Sikhs) and of the several departments of the army. The whole of this force is at Singapore, except two companies of the infantry battalion, which are at Penang. At Perak is a regiment of Sikhs, recruited from India.

Climate.

The climate varies but little in temperature during the year. The mean temperature for 1888 was 82° 5' F., the maximum and minimum temperatures being between 67° and 91°. The other settlements are from two to six degrees warmer. There are no well-marked rainy and dry seasons, the rainfall being pretty evenly distributed throughout the year, but January and February are usually the driest months. During 1888, the total rainfall was, in Singapore 66 inches, in Penang 112 inches, in Province Wellesley 123 inches, and in Malacca, 75 inches. The force of the monsoons is not much felt, though the prevailing winds are generally in the direction of the monsoon blowing at the time, viz., S.W. from April to July, N.E. from Dec. to Feb.

Population.

At the census of 1881 the population of the several settlements was as follows:

- Singapore, 139,208; Penang, 90,951; Province Wellesley, 97,824; Malacca, 93,579; The Dindings, 2,322. Total, 423,384.

Trade.

The ports are wholly free from duties on imports or exports, nor are tonnage dues levied for general purposes, and the only tax to which shipping is liable consists of a very moderate one of 2 cents or 1d. per ton register, in support of the abundant lighthouses on the coast.

The chief exports comprise tin, sugar, pepper, nutmegs, mace, sago, tapioca, rice, buffalo hides and horns, rattans, gutta, india-rubber, gambier, gum, coffee, dyestuffs, tobacco, &c. Of these the only articles produced to any considerable extent in the colony are gambier and pepper (in Singapore); tapioca and rice (chiefly in Malacca and Prov. Wellesley); and sugar (in Prov. Wellesley).

The chief imports are coal, cotton, opium, hardware, and provisions. The main trade is with the United Kingdom, India, Hong Kong, the United States, and the Dutch Indies. Singapore and Georgetown (Penang) are ports of registry; Singapore had on the 31st December, 1888, 263 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 28,596.

Tasmania.

General Description.

Tasmania is an island at the southern extremity of the continent of Australia, from which it is divided by Bass' Straits, 120 miles wide; the important gold-producing colony of Victoria being on the other side of the straits. It lies between 40° 40' and 43° 38' S. lat., and 144° 30' and 148° 20' E. long.

History.

Tasmania was discovered in 1642 by the Dutch navigator, Abel Jan Tasman, and by him named Van Dieman's Land, the name by which it was known down to 1853. It was not discovered to be an island until 1797. It was formally taken possession of by England in 1803, and made auxiliary to the penal settlement at Botany Bay. The first free emigrants arrived in 1816, and the last convicts in 1853. Responsible government was introduced in 1856.

Climate.

Tasmania is one of the most healthy of the British colonies, and is never too hot in summer nor too cold in winter for out-door occupations to be carried on; nor is it subject to the droughts experienced in the other Australian colonies.

The three spring mouths commence in September, summer in December, autumn in March, and winter in June.

From observations taken at Hobart for 1888 the highest shade temperature recorded was 98° on the 23rd of November, and the lowest 23° 5° on the 10th of August. The mean diurnal range for the year was 17° 34°. Rain fell on 151 days in the year, and the rainfall is a little more than 18 inches.

Means of Communication.

All the principal towns are united by telegraph. There are 1,894 miles of telegraph (with 2,505 miles of wire) open in the colony. This includes 359 miles of cable belonging to the Tasmanian Cable Company. The total cost of telegraph construction up to 31st Dec., 1888, was £157,180l., the receipts in 1888 being £22,621l., and the working expenses £21,202l., including £22l. miles telephone.

There is an duplicate electric cable between Tasmania and Victoria, whence land-lines extend to Port Darwin, and thence to England and Java.

Steamers run between Melbourne and Hobart and Launceston twice and sometimes thrice a week. Direct mail steamer from Hobart to Sydney every fortnight. Direct mail steamer between Hobart and New Zealand twice a month. There are also steamers trading between Launceston and the north-west ports of Tasmania and Melbourne every week. The mail steamer from Melbourne to Colombo and London every two weeks, time 42 days via Brindisi. The mail steamer from Sydney to San Francisco and thence to London, via New York, every four weeks; time about 45 days. The mail steamer via Brisbane, Singapore, and Colombo every four weeks; passage from Tasmania about 45 days. Direct communication is also afforded by the three lines of steamers, one of which calls at Hobart every month.

There are 278 places in Tasmania where post offices are established. The rates of postage are:

| Area                  | Letters per ½ oz. | Newspapers |
|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Within a town         | 1d                | free      |
| " Australasia         | 2d                | "         |
| Europe, United States | 6d                | ½d        |
| England, long sea route | 4d              | "         |

Roads.

The main road from the port of Hobart to Launceston is 123 miles long, passes through the centre of the colony, and is maintained in excellent order by the Government: all the other main roads are under the control of main road boards, and are constructed and maintained by the Government. The cross and bye roads are under the care of local trustees, and are maintained partly by rates and partly by contributions from the treasury. In 1887 the maintenance of main roads cost £19,171l., of cross and bye roads £1,615l.

Railways.

There are now 441 miles of railway in the colony constructed or in course of construction, mainly on the three foot six inch gauge. 327½ miles of these are opened for traffic, and 114 miles in course of construction.

Arrangements are being made for the purchase by the Colony of the line of 123 miles worked by the Tasmanian Main Line Company, in respect of which the colony guarantees to pay interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum on a sum not exceeding £60,000l. for 30 years. The total cost of railway construction up to 31st Dec., 1888, was £2,506,794l., the gross receipts in 1888 being £158,471l., and the working expenses £140,178l.
Land.

The upset price of Crown land fit for agriculture is 1l. an acre; and the upset price of pastoral lands is a sum equal to 12 years' rental, but not less than 5l. an acre.

Any person may select for purchase, by private contract with the Government, one lot of agricultural land not exceeding 320 acres, at 1l. an acre, with 33 per cent. for credit, payable by quarterly instalments for 14 years.

Credit is allowed on all purchases above 15l.

Industry.

The exports of the island are principally wool, tin, grain, fruit, preserves, gold, hides, skins, and leather, hops, sperm oil, timber, vegetables, and tanning bark. The value of tin and gold exported in 1888 was—tin, 426,926l.; gold, 127,582l.

The land in cultivation on 31st March, 1889, was 481,533 acres. There were in the colony 142,019 horned cattle, and 1,430,065 sheep. The quantity of wool exported in the year 1888 was 6,977,088 lb., valued at 306,930l.

Almost the whole of the trade is with Australia and the United Kingdom.

Tasmania possesses a great source of wealth in her minerals, some of which are now being turned to account. Coal, abundant in quantity and of good quality, is found in many parts of the island. Iron ores exist in great quantities, and iron of the finest quality has been produced from them. Tin in immense quantities has been discovered at Mount Bischoff, the whole mountain being said to be intersected with veins of that ore. The north-east portion of the island is also rich in that mineral. There exists in the island an enormous lode of bismuth, said to be the richest in the world. Copper, silver, and antimony have also been found, the copper yielding 30 per cent. of metal. Along the northern coast is to be found slate of first-rate quality.

Hobart and Launceston are ports of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1888, 209 vessels, of 17,988 aggregate tonnage.

Population.

On 3rd April, 1881, the population of Tasmania was 115,705, of whom 61,162 were males, and 54,543 females. The death-rate of 1881 was 14·77 to the 1,000 of the population, but for 1888-78 it was only 14 per 1,000. The number of inhabited houses was 21,858. The black aboriginal population is now extinct, but there are on the Furneaux Islands a number of half-breeds. The estimated population, 31st December, 1888, was 146,149.

Hobart, on the River Derwent, is a city of considerable size, containing (in 1887) within the Registration boundary 84,417 inhabitants.

Launceston, on the River Tamar, the second town of the colony, contains within the Registration boundary a population of 21,176 persons, and is rapidly progressing.

Local Government.

Municipal councils were established in Hobart and Launceston in 1855, when responsible government was granted to the Colony, and under the Rural Municipalities Act of 1865, councils have been established in 21 districts. These councils consist of seven elected members, two retiring annually for two successive years and three every third year. The president of the council, called the Warden, is elected annually by the councillors. The voters for the election of councillors are every male or female over 21 years of age on the assessment roll. In the districts where there are no municipalities the care of the roads is in the hands of Road Trusts. In Launceston, Hobart, Mersey, Circular Head, and Table Cape, the management of the harbours is in the hands of marine boards. The total revenue of these various bodies in 1888 was 155,074l., and the expenditure 178,023l.

The outstanding local debt on 31st December, 1888, was 409,183l.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is British sterling.

There are five banks established in the Colony, viz.: The Commercial Bank of Tasmania, the Bank of Van Diemen's Land, the National Bank of Tasmania, the Union Bank of Australia, the Bank of Australasia, with, together, 28 branches. The total assets on 31st December, 1888, amounted to 3,859,238l., deposits 3,818,455l. The note circulation on same date amounted to 152,320l.

In addition to above there are three saving bank systems, one being located at Hobart, one at Launceston, and one having many branches throughout the colony, established by Government in connection with the Post Office Department; total deposits at time of last balancing, 31st December, 1888, being 469,928l.

Education.

State schools for primary education were originally established under a board provided for by Act 27 Vict., No. 11, in 1868. In 1886 the Board was superseded by a department under the supervision of a director of education, working under the Minister of lands as ministerial head. The system is national and compulsory, but free only to children unable to pay fees, with non-sectarian religious instruction. There were 220 state schools in operation on 31st December, 1888, the number of scholars on the rolls 17,125, and the average attendance 9,000.

With a view of encouraging the pursuit of a regular and liberal course of education amongst the youth of the colony, the Council of Education was established on the 5th of November, 1888, with power to grant the degree of Associate of Arts; and scholarships were endowed to enable the more proficient youths to pursue their studies in a University of the United Kingdom. In all 21 scholarships and exhibitions are now awarded annually.

Constitution.

The constitution of Tasmania was settled by local Act (18 Vict., No. 17), constituting "the Parliament of Tasmania," supplemented by Act 34 Vic., No. 42, and Act 49 Vic., No. 12.

The Legislative Council consists of 18 members, elected for 15 electoral districts. Every member of the Legislative Council holds his seat for six years from the day of his election, at the expiration of which time his seat becomes vacant. The competency of the Council is not affected by vacancies, so long as seven members remain. No judge of the Supreme Court can be a member of the Legislative Council. The qualification for a member is to be thirty years of age, and a natural-born or naturalized subject. The qualification for an elector is the possession of a freehold estate of 20l. or leasehold of 80l. annual value, or being a barrister, graduate, or minister of religion, or an officer of the army or navy.

The House of Assembly consists of thirty-six members, elected for twenty-eight electoral dis-
**Tasmania**

Any natural-born or naturalized subject can be elected, provided that he is not a judge of the Supreme Court. The duration of the Assembly is five years. The qualification of an elector for the Assembly is to have his name included in the assessment roll of the district for which his vote is to be given as the owner or occupier of any property, or to be in receipt of income of £60 sterling per year, for 6 months prior to 1st November in any year. Voting by ballot is regulated by 21 Vict., No. 32. Parliament usually meets in July, and sits for four months. Members are not paid.

The Governor is advised by a Cabinet of responsible Ministers.

**Defence.**

The strength of the Colonial Volunteer Force is 801 officers and men. Batteries guard the mouths of the Derwent and Tamar rivers, and there are torpedo boats.
