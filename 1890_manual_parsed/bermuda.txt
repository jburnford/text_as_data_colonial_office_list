BERMUDA.

Situation and Area.

The "Bermudas" or "Somers' Islands" form a group or cluster of about 300 small islands, situated in the Western Atlantic Ocean, in lat. 32° 15' N., and long. 64° 51' W., about 580 miles to the eastward of Cape Hatteras in North Carolina, the nearest point of the neighbouring American Continent. The distance from Liverpool is about 2,900 miles, from Halifax in Nova Scotia 730, from New York 677, and from the nearest of the West Indian Islands about 800 miles. The total area is estimated at 18 square miles.

History.

These islands were discovered in the year 1515, by a Spanish mariner, Juan Bermudes, after whom they were called The Bermudas. The Spaniards however took no steps to form a settlement on the islands, and they were still entirely uninhabited when, in 1609, Admiral Sir George Somers' ship, "The Sea Venture," while on a voyage with a fleet of eight other vessels, conveying a party of colonists to the new plantations then being formed in Virginia, was wrecked upon one of the numerous sunken reefs which surround the islands on every side. The reef is still called after the name of the Admiral's ship, The Sea Venture Flat.

Sir George Somers died in Bermuda the following year, and his companions, ignorant possibly of the prior claims of Juan Bermudes, called the group after him, "The Somers' Islands." The reports of the beauty and fertility of the land taken home by Somers' nephew, Captain Mathew Somers, induced the Virginia Company to seek an extension of their Charter, so as to include the islands within their dominion, and this extension was readily granted by King James I; but shortly afterwards the Virginia Company sold the islands for the sum of 2,000l. to a new body of adventurers, called "The Company of the City of London for the Plantation of the Somers' Islands," and thenceforward, for a considerable time, the islands bore the name of the Admiral who had led thither the first body of settlers.

General Description.

The Bermudas may be described as a singular agglomeration of small islands and submarine sand hills and coral reefs, forming together an irregular oval ring, measuring about 22 miles in length from N.E. to S.W., and about 10 miles in width from N.W. to S.E. The external ring—whether composed of islands or of sunken banks or reefs—is seldom more than a mile in width, and generally considerably less.

At present the southern portion only of the encircling ring is formed of islands, the northern, eastern, and western sides being composed of almost continuous reefs of coral. The largest island, generally known as The Main Island, is about fourteen miles in length, and about a mile in average width; it contains about 9,000 acres of land, the highest point being only 240 feet above the sea. All the other islands taken together measure about 8,000 acres. The town of Hamilton, now the seat of Government, is situated about the centre of the main island, where a deep inlet running up for two or three miles into the land from the sheltered waters, enclosed between the encircling reef, forms a safe and convenient harbour for the small vessels which suffice to carry on the island trade.

Next in importance to the main island is the island of St. George, on which stands the town of St. George, so named after Admiral Sir George Somers, whose heart is buried there. This town was formerly the capital of the colony, and though now shorn of much of its importance by the transfer of the seat of Government to Hamilton, is still a town of considerable trade, and its harbour is much frequented as a harbour of refuge.

The other principal islands of the group are—Ireland Island, standing by itself in the centre of the inland waters, and entirely given up for the accommodation of Her Majesty's Dockyard and a number of other naval establishments. Boaz and Watford Islands, intervening between Ireland Island and the rest of the group, are now exclusively occupied by military depôts and garrisons; Somerset, Smith's, St. David's, Cooper's Nonsuch, Rivers, Ports, and Godets, are all inhabited by a civil population. The islands form an almost continuous chain: and with the exception of one break between Somerset and Watford Islands, there is uninterrupted communication by roads and bridges and causeways from St. George over the main island and Somerset—Watford and Boaz to Ireland Island—a distance of about 22 miles.

Nearly half the inhabitants are of English descent, the remainder belonging to the negro race. English is universally spoken.

* In 1887 the grant from the Cape was reduced to 18,000l., and the expenditure for that year includes a refund of 1,500l. to the Cape Government.
The climate has been long celebrated for its mildness and salubrity. The annual rainfall is about 60 inches, evenly distributed throughout the year. There is no winter, the thermometer never falling below 40 deg. of Fahr., and the summers are never very hot, the thermometer rarely rising above 85 deg. The summer heat too is generally tempered by a pleasant sea breeze.

Trade and Agriculture.

In former days the inhabitants of Bermuda gave themselves up almost entirely to maritime pursuits. Numerous small vessels, of from 200 to 300 tons burden, built by the islanders themselves, of their native cedar, traded between the West Indies and Demerara, and the United States, and the British colonies of North America. Later they extended their voyages, carrying the salt fish of Newfoundland to Italy and Portugal, and taking back the Port wine for which Newfoundland became celebrated, or running down to Madeira or Ascension to meet the homeward bound Indian fleet, and taking back cargoes of tea or other Indian and Chinese products to be distributed along the American seaboard.

But the repeal of the British navigation laws, the introduction of steam, and the very general substitution of iron for wooden ships, gradually destroyed the carrying trade which had been so profitable to Bermuda, and now the maritime fleet may be said to have ceased to exist, and the industry of the islanders is entirely confined to turning to account the small quantity of agricultural land which they possess. Hamilton is however still a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1888, 25 vessels, of 5,026 tons.

The soil of Bermuda may be described generally as being poor in quality, and three-fourths of the area is quite unfit for cultivation.

But the climate combined with the geographical position of these islands, in some measure compensates for the smallness of the area of fertile ground. There being nothing to fear from winter frosts, the ground can be sown and planted at any time from the end of August to the end of March, and the crops can be gathered and shipped off to New York in the months of March, April, May, and June, when the corresponding American produce has as yet scarcely shown itself above ground, and the Bermudians, taking advantage of this peculiarity of their climate, raise large crops of early potatoes, onions, tomatoes and beetroot, with which they keep the New York market supplied at a time when those vegetables cannot be obtained from any other quarter. Practically the whole of the exports go to the United States, which also supplies two-thirds of the imports, the remainder coming from the United Kingdom and Canada.

Very little use is made of the soil in Bermuda after the spring crops have been grown; a few melons, pumpkins, or sweet potatoes may be raised here and there, but by far the greater part of the ground is allowed to remain idle during the hot summer months; anything that could then be grown in Bermuda can be imported so much more cheaply from America, that it never pays a Bermudian agriculturist to produce it. Very little also of the spring produce of the islands is consumed by the inhabitants: it is too costly; nearly all the early vegetables raised in Bermuda are exported, and the whole population, civil and military, depends for its subsistence upon food supplies obtained from abroad. All the bread and meat, and nearly all the vegetables consumed in the islands, are imported from New York, and all the food, furniture, clothing, horses, and cattle are brought from that or other quarters. Of late years the islands of Bermuda have become a favourite winter resort for Americans and Canadians seeking to escape the rigours of the climate of the continent. Large hotels have sprung up, and a considerable amount of money is expended by the visitors.

Currency and Banking.

The coins in circulation are British currency, which is legal tender, and some Spanish and Mexican gold doubloons. There is no limit to the legal tender of British silver. The Bermuda Banking Company has recently established a bank at Hamilton. Messrs. N. T. Butterfield and Son have also a banking establishment at Hamilton, and several of the leading merchants do a considerable amount of business as private bankers and agents. A Government savings bank was established in 1871, and there are branches at Hamilton, St. George's, and Sandy's Parish. The number of depositors at the end of 1888 was 733; the total amount of deposits £14,528L.

Education.

In 1889 the Colonial Legislature first granted a sum of money to aid elementary schools.

The central control is vested in a Board of Education, consisting of the Governor and eight other members appointed by the Executive under the provisions of the Schools Act, 1879.

The local management is nominally in the hands of each parish vestry, which constitutes under the last named Act a local board of education.

All the schools are private schools, charging fees. Attendance is compulsory, and there were in 1888 28 aided schools, with 1,182 scholars.

There are, in addition, about 20 schools which receive no State aid.

Mail Service and Postage.

The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Cape Hatteras, but messages are usually sent via New York. A cable to Halifax (Nova Scotia) is under construction, and is expected to be opened in June, 1890.

There is a regular fortnightly mail service with New York, and a weekly service during the early spring. There is no direct service with England.

Internal Communications.

There are no railways in the Colony. There are 94 miles of colonial and 15 miles of military roads. The telegraphs are worked by the military authorities, and comprise 15 miles of cable and 82 miles of land line. The total cost of construction was £8,649L, the receipts in 1888 were £69L, and the expenditure was £21L. There is also a private telephone company, which has over 120 subscribers and upwards of 300 miles of wire in line.

Government and Constitution.

Representative government was introduced into the colony in 1620, but the charter of the Bermudian
Company of London was annulled in 1684, and since then the Governors have always been appointed by the Crown, and the laws of the colony have been enacted by a local legislature consisting of the Governor, the Legislative Council, and the House of Assembly. The session lasts usually from May to November.

The Governor is assisted by a Privy Council, consisting at present of four official and two unofficial members. The Legislative Council consists of nine members, three of whom are official and six unofficial. The House of Assembly consists of thirty-six members, four of whom are elected by each of the nine parishes. There are 1,044 electors, the electoral qualifications being the possession of freehold property of not less than £6l. value. The qualification for a member of the House of Assembly is the possession of freehold property rated at £240l.

The Naval Station.

The importance of the Bermudas as a naval station began to be felt towards the end of the last century.

The position of the islands, situated in mid-ocean, at almost equal distances from the West Indies, the eastern seaboard of the United States, and the Dominion of Canada, including our great naval station at Halifax, presents many advantages for the establishment of a Naval Station in the Western Atlantic, and the peculiar conformation of the group affords special facilities for the creation of a naval depot and fortress of the first class. A broad and almost continuous barrier, formed of a succession of islands and sunken coral reefs, and measuring about 50 miles in circuit, encloses an internal oval area of about 120 square miles of water, access to which from the outer ocean can only be gained through a few long narrow tortuous channels in which are interspersed not a few clusters of sunken coral rocks. Ireland Island—which contains Her Majesty's dockyard and the other naval establishments—occupies a central position in the midst of this enclosed sea.

The tortuous channel giving access to it is commanded throughout its whole length, as are also the approaches to it from either side, by numerous batteries mounting very heavy guns behind cast-iron shields. There is a permanent garrison of Imperial troops, numbering 1,400 men, and the mean number of the Admiralty establishment is 1,200.
