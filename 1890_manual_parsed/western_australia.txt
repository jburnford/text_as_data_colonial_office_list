WESTERN AUSTRALIA.

Situation and Area.

Western Australia comprises more than one-third of the Australian continent, namely, all that portion west of the 129th degree of E. longitude. The total area is 1,060,000 square miles. The city of Perth, the capital, is in lat. 31° 57' S., long. 115° 52' E.

History.

In 1826 the Government of New South Wales sent a detachment of soldiers to King George's Sound to form a settlement. In 1828 Captain (afterwards Sir James) Stirling, R.N., in H.M.S. "Success," surveyed the coast from King George's Sound to the Swan River, and on the 1st of June, 1829, founded the Colony of Western Australia, and the towns of Perth and Fremantle, and was appointed Lieutenant-Governor.

Large grants of land were made to the early settlers, and agricultural and pastoral occupations were pursued by a small population with varying success until, in 1850, the Colony was in a languishing condition, and the inhabitants petitioned it might be made a penal settlement. This was done, and up to 1868, 9,718 convicts were sent out. Since then no more have been sent, and the number in confinement has been lessening, until on the 30th June, 1886, only forty imperial prisoners remained. The imperial convict establishment was transferred to the Colonial Government on the 31st March, 1886. During the last five years the Colony has greatly progressed in every way, and it now contains an energetic people, rapidly increasing in number, with flourishing and expanding industries.

Constitution and Government.

The constitution is what is called "Representative," established by Act 88 Victoria, No. 13. The Government is administered by a Governor appointed by the Crown, and assisted by an Executive Council composed of the principal officers of the Government, and under the Royal Instructions, power is given to the Governor also to appoint two unofficial members to the Executive Council. There is a Legislative Council consisting of the official members of the Executive Council, with the exception of the Colonial Treasurer, 5 nominees of the Governor, and 17 elected members. This Council is presided over by a Speaker. A bill for the establishment of responsible government, having passed the legislature of the Colony, was brought before Imperial Parliament in July, 1889, but was not passed into law during that session.

The franchise for electors is 100l. freehold, or householders of 10l. annual value, or lessees of Crown lands to the same amount annual rent. The qualification for members is the possession of 1,000l. freehold beyond encumbrances.

There are 14 electoral districts: Perth, Fremantle, and the North District return two members each, and the remaining districts one member each.

Local Government.

Under Act 40 Vict., No. 13, as amended by 42 Vict., No. 16, municipal councils are allowed to levy general rates not exceeding one shilling and sixpence in the pound per annum upon the rateable value of all house and land property, and also to borrow money for the construction of permanent works, and to levy special annual rates to pay the interest thereon. All licence fees, tolls, and dues, &c., under the Municipal Institutions Act are appropriated by the council of the municipality. The following twelve municipalities have been proclaimed: Perth, Fremantle, Albany, Geraldton, Bunbury, Russelton, Guildford, York, Newcastle, Northam, Roebourne, and Cossack. The municipal councils, with the exception of the two last, which are presided over by a chairman, consist of a mayor and councillors, the mayor and chairman being elected annually, while the councillors are elected for a term of three years by the ratepayers, not including women. Under Act 40 Vict., No. 5, the local roads boards and municipal councils have power to issue licences to carts and carriages within their respective districts and municipalities. 7,972l. 10s. was granted in 1888 to district roads boards (of which there are thirty), and municipal councils for the repair and upkeep of main and minor roads and bridges throughout the Colony.

Population.

The total population of the Colony in 1881 was 29,708, and in 1888 42,137, excluding the aboriginal natives.

The chief towns are Perth (7,000), Fremantle (5,000), Albany (1,200), Geraldton (1,000), York, Bunbury, and Guildford.

Crown Lands.

Of the total area of the Colony, 2,966 square miles only have been alienated, while 166,670 square miles are leased for pastoral, and 3,220 for other purposes. No less than 887,341 square miles are still unoccupied, and in great part unexplored. At present, the whole of the coast line, a length of 3,000 miles, from Eucla in the south to Cambridge Gulf in the north, may be said to be more or less settled, for a distance inland varying from one hundred to, in some places, three hundred miles, though a considerable portion of the land taken up, especially in the Kimberley and Eucla districts, has not yet been stocked or occupied.

North of Champion Bay, large tracts of rural lands are only held on lease from the Crown for pastoral purposes, but Geraldton is the centre of a fertile and flourishing agricultural district. In the south-west corner of the Colony are situated the older settlements; indeed, it is only recently that colonisation has pushed to the north and east. In the neighbourhood of York, Newcastle, and the other centres of the southern part of the Colony, there is a considerable extent of farms and cultivation. The total cultivated area is about 106,015 acres, and, beyond this, the traveller's way lies for the most part through forests, varied by open sand plains covered with shrubs and flowering plants in infinite variety and beauty. Western Australia is famed for its "bush flowers." The flora is the most highly specialized in the world, four-fifths of the plants being endemic.

Industry.

The principal industry, as in the case of the other Australian colonies, is wool-growing. Sheep (of which there are 2,112,398) are depastured in all parts of the Colony. The northern districts are particularly favourable for stock of all kinds, and they are free from the "poison plant," which has proved such a hindrance to stock-farming in the south. The annual export of wool, principally to
London, is about 8,475,240 lbs., value £23,762l. A considerable quantity of wine is also made.

A great part of the forests of the south is heavy timber country. West Australian "Jarrah" wood is well known throughout the world for its extraordinary durability, and is in great demand for railway sleepers, piles for bridges, and harbour works, &c. There is a large and increasing export of this timber, and the forests are worked by several companies enjoying concessions from the Government. Two of these companies have constructed lines of railway of their own, together 51 miles in length, and carry on their operations on a considerable scale. The annual export of timber exceeds 40,000l. Sandalwood is still abundant, and is exported to Singapore and China, to the extent of about 35,000l. annually.

At Shark's Bay and on the north-west coast, a fleet of about 100 schooners and cutters are employed on the pearling banks. The export of pearls and pearl shell amounted to 80,311l. in 1888.

Little has been known of the mineral resources of Western Australia till within the last two years. Lead and copper mines have been opened in the neighbourhood of Champion Bay, but, owing to the fall in the value of these metals, have had to stop work. It is believed that the copper ores in this district might now again be profitably raised.

Coal has been found, and is about to be worked near the River Irwin, and also in various places in the south of the Colony. It is also said to exist near Kimberley in the north.

Gold has been found in many places. At present the Colony possesses three promising goldfields at Kimberley and Pilbara in the north, and at Yilgarn, about 250 miles east of Perth.

At the end of 1888 large deposits of stream tin were discovered near Bridgetown, on the Blackwood River. There is little doubt that an exceptionally rich tinfield exists in that neighbourhood.

Silver has been discovered, but as yet only in small quantities, near Perth.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is exclusively British sterling.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: The Western Australian Bank, National Bank of Australasia, Union Bank of Australia, Limited, Bank of New South Wales, and the Commercial Bank.

The total amount of their deposits on the 31st December, 1888, was £59,727l., and their note circulation £4,804l.

A Government Post Office saving bank at Perth, with branch offices, was established in 1863, and the deposits on the 31st December, 1888, amounted to £29,749l.

Education.

Government secular schools exist all over the Colony, and are governed by elected district boards, working under an appointed central board. Compulsory clauses exist in the Act (35 Vict., No. 14), and are enforced.

Assisted schools of different denominations are also subsidised by the State. The amount expended on education for 1888 was £11,676l. A high school is also subsidised by the State. There is a high school for girls under the direction of the Anglican Bishop, and another conducted by the Sisters of Mercy.

In January, 1889, there were 77 Government schools in the Colony, with 2,533 scholars, and 16 assisted schools, with 1,417 scholars; total 3,950.

Means of Communication.

The Colony possesses at present two lines of Government railways; a line (110 miles) connecting the chief port, Fremantle, with the capital, Perth, and with Guildford, York, and Beverley; a line (34 miles) from Geraldton to Northampton, in the Champion Bay Mining district, and 17 miles between Geraldton and Greenough; and a line (15 miles) from Bunbury to Boyanup, besides which there are several branch lines, making the total now running for traffic 198 miles. In addition to these, the Great Southern Railway (242 miles), constructed by the "West Australian Land Company, Limited," was opened for traffic on the 1st June, 1889. This line connects the port of Albany with the Government railway system at Beverley. Trains now run daily between Perth and Albany.

There are also two lines (51 miles) constructed by private timber companies in the south of the Colony; and a Government tramway (8 miles) from Roebourne to Cossack in the north-west. Concessions, on the "land grant" system, have been arranged for, under which lines are to be constructed from Guildford to Geraldton (290 miles), and from Albany to Torbay (12 miles).

The receipts of the Government railways in 1888 were £88,581l., and the working expenses £44,060l. The total cost of construction has been £23,099l. Of electric telegraph at the end of 1888 there were 3,294 miles of wire, and 600 more miles in course of erection between Derby and Wyndham (Cambridge Gulf). The number of telegrams forwarded during 1888 was 180,735, and the revenue received £8,354l. (worked by Post Office Department); cost of Post and Telegraph, £5,429l. There is telegraph communication with the world, via South Australia, and the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company has laid a cable from Java to Roebuck Bay, which gives direct communication with Europe. Postal arrangements embrace the whole of the settled portion of the Colony, both by inland services and by steamers on the coast.

The steamers of the P. and O. and Orient Companies carry mails weekly to and from the United Kingdom, and the other Australian colonies. Local steamers supply coastal communication.

The rates of postage are:

| Letters, Newspapers |
|---------------------|
| Within a town       | 1d. Free |
| Australasia         | 2d. Free |
| Europe              | 6d. 1d. |
| United States       | 2½d. ½d. |
| Eastern Colonies    | 2½d. ½d. |

Fremantle is a port of registry, with 115 vessels and a tonnage of 6,608 on 31st December, 1888.

Defence.

In August, 1889, the Volunteer force of the Colony consisted of 517 of all ranks. Of this number 65 belong to the Artillery, and the remainder to the various rifle corps. It is proposed that King George's Sound, on the south coast, is to be strongly fortified as a coaling station, at the joint expense of the Australian governments and the War Office. The port of Fremantle is also about to be fortified.
Aborigines.

The native population is not large, and in the more settled districts it is fast disappearing. They are very useful to the pioneer settlers, as shepherds, stock-riders, and general station hands, and settlement is very much assisted by their aid. In the northern districts they are largely utilised as pearl-shell divers. As a general rule they are not hostile, though very troublesome when they take to sheep-stealing. Owing to their innate liking for a roving vagrant life, it has not been found possible to do much for them, except to teach them to be useful.

Climate.

The climate of Western Australia, though hot towards the north, is one of the finest and healthiest in the world. The average death-rate is 16 per 1,000. A hot wind, for a few hours now and then in the summer months, is the only disagreeable feature. The average rainfall at Perth is 38 inches, and the mean temperature is 65°. The rainy season extends from April to September.
