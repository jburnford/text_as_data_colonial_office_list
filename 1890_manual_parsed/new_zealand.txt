NEW ZEALAND.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of New Zealand consists of three principal islands, called respectively the North, the Middle, and the South or Stewart's Island. There are several small islets (mostly uninhabited) dependent on the Colony; the chief of these are the Chatham Isles, 500 miles east, in 43° 45' S. lat., 176-177° W. long. (Chatham and Pitt are the principal islets); and the Auckland Isles. The main group lies between 38° and 53° S. lat., and 162° E. long. and 178° W. long. The three principal islands extend in length 1,100 miles, but their breadth is extremely variable, ranging from 46 miles to 250 miles; the average being about 140 miles. The area of the North Island is 44,467 square miles, of the Middle Island, 58,525 square miles, of Stewart's Island, 665 square miles, and small outlying groups of islands, 814 square miles, a total area of 104,471 square miles.

By the Act 29 Vict. cap. 23, all islands between 162° E. and 178° W. longitude, and 33° and 35° S. latitude, are annexed to New Zealand.

By letters patent, dated 18th January, 1887, the group called the Kermadec Islands, situated about 614 miles N.E. of the Bay of Islands, were annexed to New Zealand.

The Kermadec Islands are a chain of widely separated islets, lying between 29° and 32° S. lat., and 178° and 180° W. long. The principal are Raoul or Sunday, and Macauley, the next in size being Curtis and Esperance. Raoul comprises 12 square miles, is covered with forest, and rises to a height of 1,720 feet.

Climate.

The climate is temperate and very healthy, the death rate being about 11 per 1,000. The temperature is more equable than in the British Isles. While the summers are as cool as those of England, the winters are as warm as those of Italy. The mean annual temperature at Auckland is nearly the same as at Rome; at Wellington, nearly the same as at Milan; at Dunedin, nearly the same as at London. The extreme range of temperature is 46° to 68°. The annual rainfall is 50-684 inches.

History.

New Zealand was discovered in 1642 by the Dutch navigator, Tasman, who, however, did not land upon its shores. In 1769 it was visited by Captain Cook, who in that year, and during subsequent voyages, explored its coasts. The country subsequently became a resort for whalers and traders chiefly from Australia, as well as a field for the labours of the Missionary Societies from 1814. In 1840, the native chiefs ceded the sovereignty of New Zealand to the British Crown by the Treaty of Waitangi, concluded by the British Consul, Captain Hobson, and the islands became a British colony.

The aborigines, called Maoris, are a remarkable people—a branch of the Polynesian race. According to their own traditions, their forefathers came about 600 years, or twenty generations ago, from Hawaiki, which was probably Hawaii in the Sandwich Islands, or Savaii, in the Navigator, or Samoa, group. They are divided into about twenty different clans, analogous to those of the Highlands of Scotland. There have been two Maori wars; the first lasted from 1845 until 1848; the second lasted from 1860, with little intermission, until 1870. But fully half the clans have always been friendly to the English; and many of them have fought on the side of the Colonial Government against their own countrymen. Permanent tranquillity was established in 1871 throughout the country. An agitation amongst certain tribes in 1881, which threatened for a time to create a disturbance, was promptly quelled by the Colonial Government. At the census taken in March, 1886, the Maoris (including half-castes) amounted to 41,969, all of whom dwelt in the North Island, with the exception of 2,411 scattered over the other islands.

Constitution.

The country was at first a dependency of New South Wales, but was separated by letters patent in 1842. Its settlement was largely effected by the New Zealand Company, with a royal charter, which was surrendered in 1850.

Down to 1847 the Executive and Legislative Councils were both nominated by the Governor, and constitutional form of Government was established by the Imperial Statute 15 and 16 Vic. cap. 72. By that Act the Colony was divided into six provinces, increased to nine—viz., Auckland, Taranaki, Wellington, Nelson, Canterbury, Otago, Hawke's Bay, Westland, and Marlborough—each governed by a Superintendent and Provincial Council, elected by the inhabitants under a franchise which practically amounted to household suffrage.

By an Act of the General Assembly, 39 Vic. No. XXI, passed in 1875, the provincial system of Government was abolished. The powers previously exercised by superintendents and provincial officers are now exercised by the Governor or by local boards. The provincial system being abolished provision was made for the division of the country into counties, and the necessary machinery for their self-government was provided.

A Central Legislature, called the General Assembly, was also established by the Imperial Statute of 1852, consisting of the Governor, of a Legislative Council, and of a House of Representatives. The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council, composed of the Responsible Ministers of the Colony for the time being, according to the usual practice of Parliamentary Government. The Legislative Councillors are appointed by the Governor, and hold their seats for life.
The members of the House of Representatives are chosen by electors possessing a liberal franchise. Every elector is qualified to become a member. The House of Representatives now consists of 95, including 4 Maori members, elected by the natives. The session is usually from May to September.

Members of the Legislative Council, if resident over three miles from the General Assembly Buildings, receive 100l. for every session attended. If resident a distance not exceeding three miles from buildings, no remuneration.

Members of the House of Representatives receive 100l. for every session. Also 50l. in consideration of necessary expenses incurred, paid in respect of each session. But for members resident within three miles of the General Assembly buildings, the amount for expenses is 25l. instead of 50l.

The franchise for European representation is as follows:—First, every adult male if resident one year in the Colony and six months in one electoral district, can be registered as an elector.

Second, freehold property, 25l. value, held for six months before registration, entitles a man to register, if not already registered under the residential qualification. Maoris possessing a 25l. freehold under Crown title or being on any ratepayer's roll, can also register.

For Maori representation every adult Maori resident in the district can vote, and no registration is required. There are four Maori electoral districts.

For local bodies the qualification is a ratepayer's one. Women being ratepayers can therefore vote as well as men.

The control of native affairs, and the entire responsibility of dealing with questions of native government were transferred in 1863 from the Imperial to the Colonial Government. In 1865, the seat of Government was removed from Auckland to Wellington, on account of the central position of the latter city.

For the purposes of local government the Colony is divided into 82 municipalities and 75 counties; the latter being subdivided into 276 road districts and 54 town districts. For the year ended 31st March, 1888, the total revenue receipts of the various local authorities amounted to 955,410l., and their expenditure to 1,151,845l. Their outstanding loans of the same date amounted to 2,805,903l. For the year ended 31st December, 1887, the revenue, expenditure and debt of Harbour Boards amounted to 273,488l., 667,943l., and 3,006,900l. respectively.

Education.

A Government system of education was established by Law No. 21 of 1877. The central administration is vested in a Minister of Education, and the local control is in the hands of Education Boards and of School Committees, with functions subordinate to those of the Boards. Number of schools on 31st December, 1888, 1,128; number of scholars on roll, 31st December, 1888, 112,685. The schools are free and non-sectarian, and education is compulsory. The University of New Zealand examines and confers degrees and scholarships. It has a statutory endowment of 3,000l. a year. There are three colleges for university teaching at Dunedin, Christchurch, and Auckland. The last-named has a statutory endowment of 4,000l. a year; the other two have landed endowments. There are twenty secondary schools, most of them endowed the endowments being from public sources. The pupils numbered 2,094 on 31st December, 1888.

There were also at the same date 79 schools for natives as follows:—65 ordinary village schools, all maintained at the cost of the Government, and under the direct control of the Minister; 10 subsidised schools; and 4 denominational boarding schools. The numbers at the boarding schools were 181, of whom 80 were supported by Government; and at the other schools 2,512.

The number of pupils in the Deaf Mute Institution was 37, about nine-tenths of the cost being defrayed by the Government.

1,634 children belong to the authorised industrial schools, of whom 606 were in the schools, 501 boarded out, and the rest were with friends, at service, &c., under licence.

No school for the blind has yet been established. Nine blind children are maintained by the Government at the schools in Melbourne and Sydney.

Population.

The population of New Zealand on the 28th March, 1886, was found by the census to be 578,482 persons, excluding the Maoris, who numbered 41,969. The estimated population on 31st Dec., 1888, was 649,343. The population of the chief towns on the 28th March, 1886, was as follows: Wellington (the seat of the general Government), 25,945 (or including suburbs, 27,833); Dunedin, 23,248 (or including suburbs, 45,518); Auckland, 33,161 (or including suburbs, 57,048); Christchurch, 15,269 (or including suburbs, 44,688).

Industry.

All the productions of the temperate climates of Europe and Asia can be cultivated with great success in New Zealand. There are extensive coal mines and rich gold fields. The gold entered for exportation from the Colony up to 31st December, 1888, was valued at 44,843,642l.; and the annual production is now about one million sterling. The wool exported in 1888 amounted to 88,225,733 lbs., valued at 3,115,008l. In 1885 it amounted to 1,772,844 lbs., valued at 93,104l. The trade in frozen meat, which began in 1882 with an export of 15,244 cwt., valued at 19,339l., had developed an export for 1888 of 552,298 cwt., valued at 628,804l. The live stock in New Zealand, as returned at the census of March, 1886, were: Horses, 187,882, against 99,859 in 1874; cattle, 895,461, against 494,917 in 1874; sheep, 16,677,445, against 11,704,858 in 1874. The number of acres under cultivation in February, 1889, was 1,390,856, exclusive of 6,279,311 acres in sown grasses. 362,153 acres were in wheat, having an estimated yield of 8,770,246 bushels; 367,225 acres were in oats, estimated yield 10,977,065 bushels.

Auckland, Dunedin, Invercargill, Lyttleton, Napier, Nelson, and Wellington are ports of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1888, 524 vessels registered, of 65,825 tons in the aggregate.

The imports consist chiefly of textiles, hardware, and machinery, sugar, tea, alcohol, books, and stationery; and they are obtained almost entirely from England, Australia, the United States, and China.

Banking and Currency.

The following banks have branches in the Colony:—Bank of New Zealand, National Bank of New Zealand (Limited), Colonial Bank of New Zealand, Union Bank of Australia (Limited).
Bank of New South Wales, and Bank of Australasia. The total amount of their deposits in New Zealand on 31st Dec., 1888, was £11,037,631l., and of their note circulation £655,512l. There is also a Post Office Savings Bank established in the Colony, and having now 303 branches; the amount deposited therein on 31st December, 1888, was £2,048,441l.

The currency and legal tender is exclusively British sterling.

Government Life Insurance Department.

This department was constituted, on the initiative of Sir J. Vogel, by legislative enactments passed in 1869 and 1870, and commenced to transact business in March of the latter year. Its constitution was subsequently modified by Acts passed in 1874, 1884, and 1886. By the Act of 1886 an official board to control and manage the investment of a portion of the department's funds in mortgages on land is now constituted. This board consists of the Colonial Treasurer, the Solicitor-General, the Surveyor-General, the Property Tax Commissioner, the Public Trustee, and the Government Insurance Commissioner. The Act empowers loans on mortgage not exceeding £5,000l. to any one person or company. All policies are guaranteed by the State.

The conditions under which policies are issued are very liberal, whilst the rates of premium for insurance and purchase money for annuities are extremely low. Insurances are effected on individual first class lives to the amount of £4,000l. All profits belong absolutely and entirely to the policy holders themselves. After the last investigation in 1880, retrospective bonuses to the amount of £124,000l. were added to the policies then in force, notwithstanding the very low premiums.

A specimen table of rates is subjoined:

| Age nearest Birthday | Annual Premium (£) | Annuity Payable by Half-Yearly Installments, for every £100 |
|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
|                      | Male              | Female                                                   |
| 20                   | £1 15 2           | £5 10 6                                                  |
| 30                   | £2 4 3            | £5 16 4                                                  |
| 40                   | £2 18 11          | £6 8 10                                                  |
| 50                   | £4 4 4            | £7 12 6                                                  |

On the 30th of June, 1871, there were only 462 policies in force, insuring £206,474l.; but the increase of business has been very rapid. During 1888, 2,957 new policies were issued, insuring £785,093l., or £18,141l. in excess of assurances effected in 1887.

On the 31st December, 1888, there were 26,168 policies in force, assuring £7,076,252l. The resources of the Department have kept pace with the growth of the business, the accumulated funds having risen from £5,045l. on 30th June, 1871, to £1,452,478l. on 31st December, 1888, and the annual revenue having risen from £18,100l. in 1872, to £282,200l. in 1888.

Public Works Policy.

As in most of the Colonies, all the more important public works of New Zealand are in the hands of the Government and other public bodies, comparatively few having been undertaken by companies. The initiation of public works in New Zealand is coeval with the founding of the Colony, and in the early days they simply kept pace with the spread of settlement. But in 1870 a great impetus was given to the progress of the country by the inauguration of the "Public Works Policy," which provided for carrying out works in advance of settlement, and for immigration.

The first public works initiated were roads—many thousands of miles having been constructed in all directions. Some of the main roads through sparsely settled districts were made and maintained by the general Government, but the ordinary main roads are under the control of the counties, and the district roads under local boards. Nearly all the larger rivers on the main roads in both islands are bridged. A few, however, have ferries worked by the current.

At the end of the last financial year, 31st March, 1889, there were 1,777 miles of Government and 88 miles of private railways in operation in New Zealand; and 170 miles of Government lines under construction.

The expenditure on the 1,777 miles of Government railways open last year has been £18,472,837l., or an average of £7,581l. a mile; this includes all charges connected with the construction and equipment of the lines.

The revenue from the Government railways for the year 1888-9 was £997,615l., and the working expenses £647,046l. The balance of £350,570l. is equal to a return of 2l. 12s. 0d. per cent. on the capital invested.

The gauge throughout is 3ft. 6in.

Of telegraphs there are now 4,790 miles of land lines and 11,617 miles of wire, constructed at a cost of £470,581l. There are three submarine cables connecting the two islands of New Zealand, and one connecting the Colony with Australia and the rest of the civilized world. Seven of the principal towns have the telephone exchange. In the year ended December, 1888, including 23,164l. the value of Government messages, the revenue was £129,476l., and 1,795,860 messages, a decrease of 69,534 in the number in 1887, had been sent. The cost of maintenance and working was £55,465l.

Ordinary tramways have been established in all the principal towns in New Zealand, and Dunedin has in addition two cable lines leading to hilly suburbs. The ordinary tramways are in some cases worked by steam motors, but horse-power is more generally employed. The cable tramways are practically the same as those in San Francisco.

The Government has expended about £40,000l. on the construction of reservoirs, water-races, and sludge-channels on the goldfields.

All the cities and principal towns are supplied with water at the cost of the corporations. Auckland, Napier, and Lyttelton have pumping schemes, but the others are supplied by gravitation.

All the principal towns in the Colony have gasworks, some of them belonging to private companies, but the majority to the corporations. The native coal from Greymouth is stated to be one of the best in the world for making gas.

All the ports are provided with wharves and jetties in proportion to the trade. Important works to afford shelter and increase the depth of water have been executed or are in course of construction at Dunedin, Oamaru, Timaru, Lyttelton, Grey-mouth, Westport, New Plymouth, and Napier. There are graving docks at Port Chalmers, Lyttelton, and Auckland. At Wellington there is
Mail Communication.

There is regular mail communication with England by five routes (direct and via San Francisco, Brindisi, Naples, and Marseilles), and with Fiji, San Francisco, and all Australasian ports. The rates of postage are:

| Letters, per ½ oz. | Newspapers |
|-------------------|------------|
| Within a town      | 1d.        |
| Colony             | 2          |
| Australasia        | 2          |
| Europe, United States | 6       |
| England, long sea route | 4       |

Defence.

Proposals made by Governor, Sir W. F. D. Jervois, for fortifying the ports of Auckland, Wellington, Lyttelton, and Dunedin, by strong batteries and a complete system of submarine mines, are now being carried into execution. At each of the above-named ports torpedo boats fitted for Whitehead torpedoes are also provided.

A permanent force of Artillery and Torpedoists, with an engineer branch, are maintained; a force of 10,132 volunteers of all ranks has also been organized.
