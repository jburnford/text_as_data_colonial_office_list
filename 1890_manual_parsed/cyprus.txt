CYPRUS.

Situation and Topography.

The Island of Cyprus is situated in the easternmost basin of the Mediterranean Sea, with Asia Minor to the north and Syria to the east, at distances of 60 and 41 miles respectively. It lies between 34° 53' and 35° 41' N. latitude, and between 32° 20' and 34° 35' E. longitude. The port of Larnaca on the southern coast is 258 miles from Port Said, and 1,117 miles from Valletta in Malta.

It has been now systematically surveyed, and its area is 3,584 square miles. It is the third largest island in the Mediterranean, being only exceeded in size by Sicily and Sardinia. Its greatest length from west-south-west to east-north-east, between Cape Drepano and Cape St. Andrea, is about 140 miles, and its greatest breadth from north to south is about 60 miles.

The main topographical features of the island are the northern and southern mountain chains, and the great plain of the Messoria extending between them across the island from the Bay of Morphon to that of Famagusta. The northern range, called the Carpas Mountains, and, towards their western extremity, the Kyrenia Mountains, forms a continuous chain near the northern shore from Cape St. Andrea to Cape Kormakiti, a distance of about 100 miles. The southern range, which is the more extensive and lofty of the two, occupies the western and south-western portions of the island, and trending thence eastwards along the south coast, terminates in the isolated peak called Santa Croce, about 12 miles west of Larnaca. The highest summit of this range is Mount Troödos, 6,406 feet above the sea level, and on its south-eastern slopes are the summer quarters of the English troops, and of the High Commissioner who administers the Government.

The rivers of Cyprus are nearly all mountain torrents, dry in summer. None are navigable. The principal are the Pediás and the Idalia.
History.

Cyprus was colonized by Phoenicians, Egyptians, and Greeks. Its ancient history is too long and eventful to be here related even in outline. When the Roman Empire was divided into east and west, Cyprus fell into the Eastern Empire, and was governed by lieutenants of the Byzantine Emperors until 1191, when Richard I of England occupied the island to chastise the ruler, Isaac Comnenus, for the ill-treatment of the English fleet. Richard sold the island in 1192 to the Templars, but as they could not govern it, the king made it over to Guy de Lusignan, who claimed to be King or formerly King of Jerusalem, and undertook the obligations of the Templars. The island was ruled by the Lusignan family from 1192 until 1489, when Queen Catarina Cornaro, herself a Venetian and widow of James II, having survived her husband and his posthumous son, James III, yielded the government of the island to the Republic of Venice. Venice ruled the island until 1570-71, when the Ottoman Turks invaded it, and captured and put to the sword the Venetian garrisons.

The island remained under the government of the Sultans of Constantinople from 1571 until 1878, with the exception of the period from 1832 to 1840, when it was held by the Pasha of Egypt, then at war with the Porte. It may be observed that the island was frequently invaded by the Arabs, Saracens, and Egyptians before its final conquest by the Turks, and that from 1425 to 1571, it paid tribute to Egypt. The great fortress and port of Famagusta was held by the Genoese Republic from 1373 until 1464, when the Lusignan king, James II, retook it with the help of the Egyptians.

Climate.

The mean temperature is about 66° Fah. The mean maximum for the last eight years was 102°, the mean minimum 31°8'; the highest temperature recorded in the period being 116°. The average rainfall in the last eight years was 17 in., the rainy season being from October to March. There are occasional droughts.

Population.

The population of the several districts at the census taken in 1881 was:—Nicosia, 56,812; Famagusta, 38,207; Larnaca, 20,766; Limassol, 29,248; Paphos, 28,424; Kyrenia, 13,216. The total population was 186,173, of whom the Moslems form about one-fourth, the rest being nearly all Christians of the Orthodox Greek Church. The estimated present population is 200,000. The birth rate as computed 1888-89, is 27·8 per thousand per annum, the death rate 15·1 per thousand.

Towns.

The chief towns are Nicosia, the capital, 11,536 inhabitants; Larnaca, 7,833; Limassol, 6,006. The two latter are open roadsteads. At Famagusta, on the east, it has often been proposed to construct a great commercial and naval harbour; but at present the town is little more than a collection of ruins encircled by fortifications, and it has only 658 inhabitants, nearly all Moslems. Varosia, a suburb of Famagusta, has a population of 1,906, nearly all Christians. The four towns already mentioned are the capitals of four of the six administrative provinces into which the island is divided—the other two capitals being Ktima, the modern capital of Paphos, on the south-west, and Kyrenia, where a small harbour is now being constructed in the district of the same name, on the north coast, which has some trade with the opposite coast of Karamania.

Industry.

Cyprus was in ancient times famous for its mines, but they have not been worked in modern times. One or two concessions have, however, been recently granted to persons desirous of renewing the mining industry. Gypsum and terra umbra are exported. The wealth of the island consists mainly in its agricultural produce, chiefly corn, cotton, carob (locust), beans, linseed, madder, olives, silk, raisins, fruit, vegetables, cheese, wool, hides, and wine. The common wines are for the most part exported to Syria, Egypt, Turkey, and Trieste; but both the common and the richer wines are exported to Austria, Italy, and France, to be used in giving strength and flavour to the fruit of poor vineyards. Cyprus wine is perhaps somewhat heavy for ordinary use, and its value in commerce has been lessened by the tarry flavour it derives from the practice of carrying it to port in tarred skins. This practice is being discouraged as much as possible, and the construction of roads through the grape districts enables the wine to be conveyed in barrels.

The agricultural prosperity of the island is greatly retarded by want of water. The rainfall is somewhat deficient in the whole, and has not been made the best use of; although it is hoped that under measures passed in the Legislature of 1887 and 1889 facilities will be found for constructing irrigation works.

Much injury to crops has also been caused in the past by locusts, but the numbers are now considerable and but little damage is done. The work of locust destruction was vigorously prosecuted for many years with great success, chiefly on what is known as the "screen and pit system." The screens are stretched across the country in front of the armies of young locusts on the march, and being topped with oilcloth, the locusts cannot get over them, and are gradually forced into pits dug at intervals transversely to the screens, from which they cannot emerge, as they are topped with a zinc lining.

In 1889, there were 194,422 sheep and 210,608 goats, a large reduction on previous totals.

The island, which contains more goats in proportion to area than any other country, has suffered greatly from the extensive destruction of its forests, but what remains of them is recovering, although slowly, under the better care now bestowed upon them.

Sponge fishing is extensively carried on along the coast by boats from Kálymnos and other islands.

The chief imports are cotton and woollen goods, tobacco, groceries, rice, alcohol, iron, leather, petroleum, timber, sugar, soap, and copper manufactures; the exports are chiefly corn, cotton, carobs, linseed, madder, olives, silk, raisins, fruit, vegetables, cheese, sumac, wool, hides, wines, and spirits.

Currency and Banking.

Under an Order in Council which came into operation on the 1st August, 1882, the following coins are legal tender currency:—Gold, the sovereign, half-sovereign, Turkish lira, and French 20-franc piece. Silver, the florin, shilling, sixpence, and three-pence, limit of tender 3l. Bronze, the piastre (nine equa
to one shilling), half piastre; quarter piastre; limit of tender, 27 piastres.

There are two banks, the Imperial Ottoman and the Anglo-Egyptian, each having branches or agencies at Larnaca, Nicosia, Limassol, Famagusta, Papho, and Kyrenia.

There is as yet no Government savings bank.

Means of Communication.

There is no railway or navigable waterway in the island, but good roads between all important places are now maintained. There are no Government telegraphs, but the Eastern Telegraph Company and the Imperial Ottoman Telegraph Administration work about 240 miles of land line in connection with their cables. The island is in direct telegraphic communication with Alexandria and Latakia (Syria), by means of the cables of the Eastern and the Imperial Ottoman Telegraph Companies respectively.

There is a fortnightly mail service with Alexandria, and a weekly mail with Smyrna and Constantinople by the "Austrian Lloyd" and "Messageries Maritimes" steamers. There are also frequent direct steamers to and from Egypt and the adjacent coast of Syria.

The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters per ½ oz. Newspapers |
|-----------------------------|
| Within the island ½ c. p.    |
| England                    | ½ "                           |

Education.

A general system of grants in aid of efficient schools was established in 1882. The total grant (£3,000) is divided into two portions, one quarter being shared among the Moslem, and three-quarters among the Christian schools. 13,420 children enrolled in 1888.

No provision is made for higher or technical education.

Leprosy.

Prior to the British occupation, provision was made for only seven lepers in the leper asylum or farm near Nicosia, which was originally founded by the dragoman to the Turkish governor early in this century.

The asylum has now been improved and enlarged, and accommodates 65 persons, on an enclosed farm of 200 donums (one donum equals about ¼ acre), a portion of which the lepers cultivate. In addition each person receives a Government allowance of 2½ c. p. daily.

No leper quits the farm except the village headman, who purchases every morning the daily necessaries for the community, but no compulsion is used to compel entrance into or continuance in the farm.

The census of 1881 returned 78 lepers, or about 4 per 10,000 of population, but there are probably a few more in far-outlying villages. In 1878 there were about 150 altogether, but there are now probably not 100, some 30 outside and 68 inside the farm.

The disease shows itself in two principal forms, the tubercular, and the anesthetic; of the latter there is a notable sub-group, elephantiasis mutilans, in which spontaneous amputation of fingers, toes, and even whole members occurs. In the other form the skin and mucous membranes are the parts chiefly affected, especially the face and head. This form is more common, more dreadful in its effects, and more rapid in its termination; but neither of the two can be called a fatal disease, as their average duration is 10–20 years, and some lepers live to be quite old people.

Leprosy is slightly more common among males than females; the greater proportion of cases come from low-lying villages in the districts of Famagusta, and cases among Mussulmen are of the greatest rarity. About 5 per cent. of the villages have had cases. Hereditary infection can be traced in most instances, while malarial taint and improper food appear to be the provoking cause; it is doubtful, however, whether cases ever occur without personal contagion. The disease is believed to be slowly decreasing.

British Occupation.

On the 4th June, 1878, a Convention was signed at Constantinople between the representatives of Her Britannic Majesty and the Sultan of Turkey, by which England engaged to join the Sultan in defending his Asiatic possessions against Russia in certain contingencies, and the Sultan, "in order to enable England to make necessary provision for executing her engagements," consented "to assign the Island of Cyprus, to be occupied and administered by England." On the 1st of July an Annex to this Convention was signed at Constantinople, in explanation of the conditions of the occupation. The following is the English official version of its provisions:

"I. That a Mussulman religious Tribunal (Mahkémé-i-Shéríeh) shall continue to exist in the island, which will take exclusive cognizance of religious matters, and of no others, concerning the Mussulman population of the island.

"II. That a Mussulman resident in the Island shall be named by the Board of Pious Foundations in Turkey (Evkaf) to superintend, in conjunction with a Delegate to be appointed by the British Authorities, the administration of the property, funds, and lands belonging to mosques, cemeteries, Mussulman schools, and other religious establishments existing in Cyprus.

"III. That England will pay to the Porte whatever is the present excess of revenue over expenditure in the island; this excess to be calculated upon and determined by the average of the last five years, stated to be 22,936 purses, to be duly verified hereafter, and to the exclusion of the produce of State and Crown lands let or sold during that period.*

"IV. That the Sublime Porte may freely sell and lease lands and other property in Cyprus belonging to the Ottoman Crown and State (Arazî Miriyé ve Emlâki Houmayoun), the produce of which does not form part of the revenue of the island referred to in Article III.

"V. That the English Government, through their competent authorities, may purchase compulsorily, at a fair price, land required for public improvements, or for other public purposes, and land which is not cultivated.

"VI. That if Russia restores to Turkey Kars and the other conquests made by her in Armenia during the last war, the Island of Cyprus will be evacuated by England, and the Convention of the 4th of June, 1878, will be at an end."

Government.

On the 14th September, 1878, an Order in Council was issued for the regulation of the government

* The exercise of these rights by the Porte was agreed to be abandoned, from the 1st of April, 1879, for a payment of £5,000 a year.
of the island. The administration was placed in the hands of an officer styled High Commissioner; a Legislative and an Executive Council were established, and the High Commissioner was invested with the powers of pardon, appointment, suspension from office, &c., &c., usually conferred upon a Colonial Governor. So much of this Order in Council as relates to legislation has been superseded by another, dated the 30th Nov., 1882, under which the Legislature consists of the High Commissioner, who is usually to preside, six non-elective Members, being office-holders, and twelve elected Members, three to be chosen by the Mahometan and nine by the non-Mahometan inhabitants of the Island. British subjects and foreigners who have resided five years in Cyprus can exercise the franchise, and are eligible for election as well as Ottoman subjects. The qualification for the franchise consists in the payment of any class of the taxes called Verghi. The Council may be dissolved by the High Commissioner whenever he sees fit, and must be dissolved at the end of five years. The island, for legal and administrative purposes, is divided into six districts, namely—Nicosia, Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta, Kyrenia, and Papho. In each the Government is represented by a Commissioner.

The courts which were in existence at the time of the occupation have been superseded by a new set of courts constituted by an Order of Her Majesty in Council, dated the 30th November, 1882, which provides for:

(1) A supreme court of criminal and civil appeal, consisting at present of two judges.

(2) Six assize courts, having unlimited criminal jurisdiction, and consisting of one or more judges of the supreme court, sitting with one or more judges of the district courts.

(3) Six district courts, having criminal jurisdiction up to three years' imprisonment, and unlimited civil jurisdiction; and consisting of a President and two ordinary Members, one a Christian and the other a Moslem.

(4) Six Magistrates' courts, consisting of the President of the district court or the two ordinary Members having summary jurisdiction up to one month's imprisonment and fine of 5l.

(5) Village courts, at present ten in number, in addition to the judges of the district courts, and having jurisdiction in cases of commonage, disputes as to the partition of property, and debt, &c., up to 5l.

Actions in the courts are divided into "Ottoman" and "Foreign" actions, according to the nationality of the defendant or defendants, and in "Foreign" actions the President of the court alone generally exercises jurisdiction; as also in criminal cases against non-Ottomans.

The Mahkem-i-Shérieh, or Mussulman religious courts, are presided over by Cadis, but their duties are strictly confined to jurisdiction in religious cases affecting the Mahometan population, as contemplated by the Anglo-Turkish Convention.

The principal sources of revenue in Cyprus are:

1. Verghi Taxes—Consisting of—

   (1) A tax of 4 per 1,000 on the capital value of lands or houses occupied by the owner.

   (2) A tax of 4 per cent. on the annual rent of lands or houses let.

   (3) A tax of 3 per cent. on trade profits or salaries.

2. Military exemption tax of 2s. 6d. a head on males between 18 and 60 years of age.

3. Tithes of the principal products of the island, assessed in money.

4. Sheep, goat, and pig tax.

5. An excise on wine, spirits, and tobacco.

6. Stamps, court fees, royalties, licences, &c., &c.

7. Salt monopoly.

8. Locust tax (temporary) of 1 per cent. on tithes and certain incomes (for locust destruction).

9. Import duties according to the following tariff:—

Tithes on grapes and on certain minor articles have been abolished; carobs and silk cocoons pay tithe only on exportation. An export duty of 12 per cent. is charged on raisins, and of 10 per cent. on linseed. All other export duties, and a fishing tax, have been abolished by the British Administration.

Total Customs revenue in 1888-9, £21,126L.

There is a military police force of about 680 men, mostly Moslems.

Archaeology.

Cyprus is remarkable for its medieval architectural remains, and the vast quantity of antiquities in the shape of coins, inscriptions, ornaments, statues, and pottery, of very ancient date, which have been discovered. A famous collection of Cypriot antiquities, that of General di Cesnola, the late United States Consul, is in the Metropolitan Museum at New York. A local museum was started in 1883 by subscription.
