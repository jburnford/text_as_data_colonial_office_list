TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Turks and Caicos Islands lie between 21° and 22° N. lat., and 71° and 72° 37' W. long. Their area is 169 square miles. The most important island, Grand Turk, is 64 miles long and 2 miles broad. It contains 2,500 inhabitants, being half the total population.

History.

These islands were originally settled from Bermuda in the eighteenth century, and formed at first a portion of that Colony. In 1799 they were transferred, for purposes of government, to the Colony of the Bahamas, to which group they geographically belong. In 1848 they were made independent of the Bahamas, and were placed under the Governor of Jamaica, an arrangement which still continues.

Industries.

Salt raising is the only industry of any importance, the quantity annually gathered exceeding 1½ million bushels. Spouges are found in some quantities on the Caicos Bank, but are chiefly collected by Bahamas schooners and carried to Nassau. There is one sponge curing establishment on the Caicos Islands. The cultivation of the Manila fibre (or Piña plant) is being extensively introduced, with every prospect of success.

An agricultural settlement was started under Government auspices at Kew, North Caicos in 1882, to grow fruit for export, but has proved a failure, owing to the absence of any remunerative market for the produce. The soil elsewhere is totally unfit for agricultural purposes. Practically the whole of the food and household necessaries are imported. The commercial intercourse is almost wholly with the United States.

The inhabitants are of mixed European and African extraction, the proportion of whites to coloured people being larger than in most of the West Indies. The majority of the people are connected with the Bermudas, from which these islands were first settled. They all speak English. Grand Turk is a port of registry, and had on the 31st December, 1888, 47 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 6,274 tons. Salt Cay and Cockburn Harbour are ports of entry, possessing good anchorage.

Climate.

The climate is equable and healthy, and rarely unpleasantly hot, owing to the strong and never failing sea breezes.

The mean temperature (day) is 82°, the extreme range being from 65° to 92°. The rainfall varies from 23 to 43 inches, the rainy season being from October to February.

Means of Communication.

Messrs. Pickford and Black's steamers, running under Government contract, leave Halifax for Jamaica on the 15th of every month, calling at Turks Islands both going and returning.

The Clyde Line from New York to Hayti calls at Grand Turk every three weeks, the length of passage being six days. There are no railways or telegraphs in the Colony.

The rate of letter postage to nearly all parts of the world is 4d. per half ounce. There is no internal post.

The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Mole St. Nicholas, Hayti, distant 165 miles.

Education.

There are seven elementary schools supported by Government, with an attendance in 1888 of 760 children. The schools are entirely unsectarian, and are at present free. A compulsory education ordinance, providing also for the payment of fees, was passed in 1883, but the compulsory clauses have never been proclaimed.

Currency and Banking.

The coins in circulation, all of them being legal tender under Bahama Acts, 2 Vict. cap. 4, and 8 Vict. cap. 49, also Jamaica Law 10 of 1880, consist of British sterling, United States gold and silver, Spanish Mexican, and Columbian gold doubloons,
and Jamaica nickel tokens. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver. There is no paper currency. Commercial accounts are usually kept in dollars, and Government accounts in sterling. A Government saving bank was established in 1889.

Constitution.

The legislature consists of a Legislative Board consisting of the Chief Commissioner and Judge and not less than two, nor more than four, other persons appointed by the Governor of Jamaica. Taxation and expenditure, and all local matters, are regulated by this Board, but certain laws passed by the Legislative Council of Jamaica relating to currency, divorce, and civil appeals which were in express terms made applicable to Turks Islands, still take effect there.
