TOBAGO.

History.

Tobago was discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. The British flag was first planted on the island in 1580, and the sovereignty was regularly claimed by James I in 1608. In 1625 an attempt was made by some adventurers from Barbados to form a colony; but many were killed by the Carib Indians, and the remaining few escaped and settled at Providence. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when 300 Zealanders were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of about two years these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641, James, Duke of Courland, obtained a grant of the island from Charles I, and in 1642 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole Island until 1662, when the Dutch Company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lampsin procured letters patent from Louis the Fourteenth, creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognise the Duke's title, but in 1677 they themselves were compelled to evacuate the island by the French Admiral Binks in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis the Fourteenth restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1681, made over his title to a Company of London merchants. In 1684, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral; the subjects of all European powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce, but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to England in perpetuity.

In 1781, Tobago was captured by the French under the Duke of Bouillie, after a most gallant defence by the colonists. In 1788 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. On 15th April, 1798, it was captured by a British Force under Admiral Lefroy and General Cuyler, and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Peace in 1802, and again reconquered in 1803, by Commander Hood and General Greenfield; and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

Under Act 50 and 51 Vict., cap. 44, Tobago becomes part of the Colony of Trinidad from 1st Jan., 1889.

Situation and Area.

It is the most southerly of the Windward group of the British West India Islands, in N. lat. 11° 9', W. long. 60° 12'; distant from Barbados about 120 miles, from Grenada about 75 miles, and about 20 N.E. of Trinidad, and expands N.E. and S.W. The distance between Tobago and Toco, a port of Trinidad by actual survey made by Mr. Parsons, R.N., in 1865, is 184 miles in a south-westerly direction. It is 26 miles long and 73 at its greatest breadth, and has an area of 114 square miles, or 73,313 acres, of which about 10,000 acres is under cultivation. About 15,000 acres of land were unowned, and have now been re-vested in the Crown.

The formation of the island is volcanic; its physical aspect is irregular and picturesque, with conical hills and ridges, which descend from a
common base or dorsal ridge 1,800 feet high and 18 miles in length.

**General Description.**

Sugar, rum, molasses, cocoanuts, and live stock form the principal articles of export. The first sugar exported was from an estate on the windward side of the island, in the year 1770. In 1780 there were only 3,000 hogsheads shipped; this was increased in 1805 to no less than 15,327 hogsheads. Cotton and indigo were formerly exported. In 1780, 2,619,000 lbs. of cotton and 27,000 lbs. of indigo are stated to have been shipped to England.

The island is divided into seven parishes. Scarborough, the principal town, is on the south side of the island, about 8 miles from the S.W. point, and is situated at the south-western base of a hill 425 feet above the level of the sea, on which stands Fort King George, now without a garrison. The town has a population of about 1,370. It is a port of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1888, 3 vessels, of together 90 tons. Courland Bay, at Plymouth, also has good anchorage. There is a lighthouse at Bacole Point, Scarborough; it is a fixed white light, at an elevation of 128 feet above the level of the sea.

Education is in the hands of the Anglican, Moravian, and Wesleyan bodies, who maintain 20 schools with 2,275 scholars, assisted by a Government grant of 500l.

**Constitution.**

The Government was formerly administered by a resident Administrator, subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands at Grenada, and a Legislative Council was established by an Order in Council of the 7th of February, 1877, to consist of not less than three persons, designated by Her Majesty.

By an Order in Council of 17th November, 1888, issued under Act 50 and 51 Vict., cap. 44, Tobago has been amalgamated with Trinidad, the name of the new Colony being Trinidad and Tobago. The latter island will be administered by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor of the united Colony, who shall be ex officio a member of the Legislative Council, and at least one unofficial member must be a resident in Tobago. The Commissioner will be assisted by a financial board of five members, two nominated by the Governor and three elected. The revenue, expenditure, and debt of the islands will remain distinct, but there will be entire freedom of commercial intercourse between them, and the laws of Trinidad will, with some specified exceptions, become the law of both. The customs tariff is the same as that of Trinidad.

The total Customs revenue in 1888 for Tobago alone was 5,039l.
