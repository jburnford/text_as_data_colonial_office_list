THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.

(See Map, page 23).

Situation and Area.

The Leeward Islands form the most northerly group of the lesser Antilles. Some of them belong to Denmark (part of Virgin Islands), Holland, (St. Eustatius, Saba, a part of St. Martin), and France (Guadeloupe, Martinique, St. Bartholomew, and part of St. Martin). The English Leeward Islands (except Sombrero, see page 301), comprising the Colonies of Antigua, Montserrat, St. Kitts, Nevis, Dominica, and the Virgin Islands, were constituted a single Federal Colony by an Act passed in the Imperial Parliament in the Session of 1871, 34 & 35 Vict., cap. 107. The total area of the Colony is 704 square miles, and its population about 120,000.

History.

The Islands were discovered by Columbus in 1498, and became British during the 17th century.

Particulars of their subsequent history will be found in the separate articles, but it may here be mentioned, as of historical interest that the Leeward Islands possessed a common Legislature as far back as the reign of William and Mary. Some Acts passed by that Legislature are still in force in the several islands, notably one "to provide for the want of fines and common recoveries," under which entails and settlements of real property are effected, and which is considered creditable to the sagacity of the Colonists of the day as having anticipated by nearly a century and a half a very beneficial reform only effected in this country in the year 1833, by the Act 8 and 4, Will. IV., c. 74.

The General Legislature met for the last time in 1798, when it passed a highly humane slave amelioration Act, which was allowed, a Catholic Emancipation Act, and an Act repealing the duty on exports of 44 per cent. for the benefit of the English exchequer—both which were disallowed. An attempt was made by Sir William Colebrook in 1832 to revive the General Legislature, and though the attempt was regarded unfavourably in some quarters, and the Legislature never actually met, yet the right to revive it was clear, and there is no doubt that the Act of 1871, the passing of which was largely due to the energy and activity of Sir Benjamin Pine, is no more than a revival of the ancient constitution of the islands. The Colonies of St. Kitts and Nevis, with Anguilla and their respective dependencies, were united into one Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1882.

Climate.

The climate of the islands varies, but is usually dry and fairly healthy. Antigua is subject to drought, and has an average rainfall of about 30 inches; the other islands average twice as much. The mean temperature is about 80°, with but a slight range. The Virgin Islands are cooler, but more subject to hurricanes. The hot season is from May to October; the rainy season from August to December. Dominica is the hottest and least healthy of the group.

Constitution.

By "The Leeward Islands Act, 1871," one Executive and one Legislative Council, under one Governor, were constituted for the six (now five) presidencies. As reconstituted by the Federal Act No. 15 of 1882, the Legislative Council now consists of ten elective and ten nominated members. Four elective members are chosen by the elective members of the Island Council of Antigua, two by those of the Legislative Council of Dominica, and four by the non-official members of that of St. Kitts and Nevis. They must be and continue members of their respective island councils. The nominated members appointed by the Queen are the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Auditor-General, and the President of St. Kitts and Nevis, with five unofficial members, one from each of the island councils, and another member of one of them who acts as President.

The Legislative Council has concurrent legislative powers with the local legislatures on certain subjects specified in the Act, such as matters of property, mercantile and criminal law, and the law relating to status and procedure in the maintenance of a general police and convict establishment, quarantine, postal and telegraph affairs, questions of currency, audit and weights and measures, education and the care of lunatics, all matters relating to immigration, and its own constitution and procedure. Any island legislature is, in addition competent to declare other matters to be within the competency of the general legislature. Any island enactment on such subjects is void if repugnant to an enactment of the general legislature, or may at any time be repealed or altered by one.

The Council meets once a year, at a place notified by proclamation (usually at St. John, Antigua), and no Council lasts more than three years. The session usually lasts from two to four weeks.

The expenses of the federal establishments are voted by the Council, and apportioned among the Presidencies, Antigua bearing five-sixteenths, Dominica three-sixteenths, Montserrat one-sixteenth, St. Kitts and Nevis three-eighths, and the Virgin Islands one-sixteenth.

The Council has power to alter its constitution by an ordinary Act, to be reserved for the Queen's pleasure, and the Queen has power at any time to include any other West Indian Island in the federation, upon joint addresses from both Councils.

Currency and Banking.

The usual currency is British silver, a few British and United States gold coins being occasionally met with. In addition to these, the gold doubloons are legal tender. The Colonial Bank has a branch in Antigua, one in St. Kitts, and one in Dominica. In the Virgin Islands, Montserrat, and Nevis, there are no banks. The notes of the Colonial Bank circulate in Antigua (£3,500.), and St. Kitts (£14,000.), and those of the Danish Bank of St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands.

There is no limit to silver as a legal tender.

Government savings banks have been established in all the Presidencies except the Virgin Islands.

Means of Communication.

Mail communication exists between England and the Southern Islands, including Trinidad, and with the Northern Islands and Jamaica, once a fortnight, by the steamers of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. Also to the same islands, as far as Trinidad, and to the United States of America, once a fortnight, by the steamers of the Quebec and Gulf Ports Line. Intermediate mails are also made up for the above places by the steamers of Messrs. Scrutton's Direct Line and others. There is now no steamer belonging to the Federal Government.

Two telegraph cables connect Dominica with St. Lucia and Martinique, and two St. Kitt's with Antigua and St. Thomas; Antigua is also connected with Guadeloupe, and thence with the United States and Europe. The other islands are not in telegraphic communication by cable, the nearest cable station to the Virgin Islands being St. Thomas and St. Croix, and the nearest to Montserrat, Barbuda, and Redonda being Antigua and...
St. Kitts. There are no railways or internal telegraphs.

Postage.

The rates for external postage are those of the Postal Union (to England 4d. per ½ oz.). Inland postal arrangements exist in Antigua, St. Kitts, Nevis, and Dominica, the rates being 1d. the ½ oz. within each of the islands.

Chief Towns.

The most important towns are St. John (Antigua), 10,000; Basseterre (St. Kitts), 7,000; and Roseau (Dominica), 4,500.

Defence.

There is no Imperial garrison.

In Antigua there is a Yeomanry Cavalry Corps consisting of 48 officers and men, and small Artillery Corps. In St. Kitts there was until 1888 a Horse Artillery Corps, and two troops of Cavalry, the strength of the former being 26 men, and of the latter 56, officers included.

There are numerous old forts, mostly dismantled and in ruins, situated round the coasts of the several islands.

Education.

The system of elementary education is denominational, the various denominations being Anglicans, Moravians, Wesleyans, and Roman Catholics. The schools established by these denominations receive grants in aid from the local revenues of each Presidency. School fees are charged, and the schools are required to receive all children applying for admission. Grants in aid are refused to superfluous or inefficient schools. There are about 120 aided schools, attended by 12,778 children. Grants of 200l. each per annum are also made to grammar schools established in St. Kitts and Antigua. There is no provision for technical education.
