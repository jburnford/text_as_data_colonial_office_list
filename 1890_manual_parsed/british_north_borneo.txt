BRITISH NORTH BORNEO.

Situation and Area.

The territory under the jurisdiction of the British North Borneo Company (incorporated by Royal Charter under date of 1st Nov., 1881), now known as "the State of North Borneo," comprises the whole of the northern portion of the island of Borneo from the Sipitong River on the west to the Sibuco River on the east coast, together with all the islands within a distance of three leagues, including those of Banguey and Balembangan; it is held under grants from the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu, and contains an area of 30,709 square miles, with a coast line of about 900 miles. It extends from 115° 20' to 119° 20' E. long., and from 3° 50' to 7° 25' N. lat.

The principal stations of the Company are at Sandakan (where are also the headquarters of the administration), and Silam on the east, Kudat on
the north, Gaya on the west and Mempakol (in Brunei Bay). At each of these there are excellent harbours, especially at the first-named, which is situated in a magnificent bay some fifteen miles in length, with an average breadth of five miles. It is 1,000 miles from Singapore, 1,200 from Hong Kong, and 1,600 from Port Darwin.

**General Description.**

The greater part of the country is at present covered with jungle, but the soil is found to be well adapted for the growth of almost all tropical products, more particularly tobacco, sugar, coffee, sago, tapioca, &c. 600,000 acres have already been alienated on 999 years' cultivation leases.

The mineral resources of the country have not yet been fully investigated. Gold has been found in two of the rivers on the east coast; coal, copper, and other minerals have also been met with, but so far have not been worked.

The country is mountainous, although the shore is flat and fringed with mangrove. The highest point yet discovered is Kinabalu, 13,698 feet.

The inhabitants, who are supposed to number about 200,000, are mainly wandering Dyaks, who remove their villages periodically, and live by hunting and plunder, with occasional attempts at planting and trade. There are Malay and Chinese settlements on the coasts, which cultivate the flat areas, and carry on a considerable trade. Sandakan, the chief town, has a population of 5,000.

**History.**

The state and town of Brunei appear to have been prosperous from a very early age. They were visited by Europeans in 1822, 1503, and 1520, but the first settlement in Borneo was made by the Dutch at Landak and Sudakana in 1608, and soon abandoned. An English settlement was made in 1609, and abandoned 1628. The Dutch factories were re-established in 1747 and 1776, but finally given up in 1790.

A British settlement was formed under the East India Company in 1762 at the island of Balembangan, which had been ceded by the Sultan of Sulu. This was attacked by pirates in 1775, and the staff was removed to Labuan, a small factory being at the same time established at Brunei. A second attempt in 1803 was made to establish a settlement on the former island, and on its failure, the East India Company gave up its connection with Northern Borneo.

Sir James Brooke, in 1840, established the independent State of Sarawak, which, as well as Brunei, is under the exclusive influence of Great Britain; and Labuan became a British colony in 1846. Some Americans obtained extensive cessions in North Borneo in 1866 from the Sultan of Brunei, but they were never utilised. Finally, in 1877 and 1878, the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu ceded the same district to Mr. Alfred Dent, who transferred it to the British North Borneo Company, and some further cessions have since been added to the Company's territory. The British Government assumed a formal protectorate over the Territory by agreement with "the State of North Borneo," dated the 12th May, 1888. By this agreement the State is to continue to be administered by the Company as an independent State, under the protection of Her Majesty's Government, who may appoint consular officers, and shall conduct all foreign relations, but does not interfere in internal administration.

**Climate.**

The climate, though tropical, is equable; the temperature varies from 70° to 93°, but there is usually a light breeze. The annual rainfall is about 120 inches, chiefly from November to February.

**Industry.**

Agriculture is now beyond its primitive state, and certain of the more advanced tribes use the plough and harrow. The chief products are tobacco, sago, rice, coffee, pepper, tapioca, maize, sugar, and pine-apple fibre. There is still a large trade in the collection of jungle produce; but during the past year much attention has been given to the cultivation of tobacco. The soil and climate have proved to be eminently suited for its growth; several estates have been successfully opened for its cultivation, and additional land is being eagerly taken up by several syndicates.

The exports comprise tobacco, sago, rice, coffee, pepper, tapioca, maize, sugar, pine-apple fibre, gutta-percha, indiarubber, rattans, beeswax, edible birds' nests, camphor, resin (called damar), gold, &c., sent almost entirely to Singapore, China, and Australia; from Singapore part of these find their way to Europe.

A timber trade has been opened with both Australia and China.

The Company does not itself engage in trade.

The revenue is derived from import duties, stamps, and royalties on the various exports, a poll tax, licences for the sale of opium, spirits, and tobacco; and from the sale and rent of forest lands, suburban lots, and town sites. 600,000 acres have been sold on 999 years cultivation leases, 18 tobacco estates and 4 general plantations have been opened by Europeans, especially the Dutch, and the demand for land has been so great as to cause the price to be raised during 1888 from $1 to $5 per acre. Pepper and sago are exported from the West Coast. At the end of 1888 four timber companies were engaged in the timber trade, chiefly with China. One saw-mill was at work, and another is being erected.

**Currency and Banking.**

The Company has a copper coinage of ½ and 1 cent pieces, and it issues notes, expressed in dollars, to the extent of $100,000. American dollars, Mexican, Straits Settlements and Hong Kong currency also circulate to some extent. There is an agency of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, and the Company does banking business when required.

Money orders on North Borneo are issued in England, India, and elsewhere, and vice versa.

**Constitution.**

The territory is administered by a court of directors in London, appointed under the Royal Charter; and a Governor, Government Secretary, and Residents appointed by them. There are 9 provinces (Alcock, Cunliffe, Dent, Dewhurst, Elphinstone, Keppel, Martin, Mayne, and Myburgh).

The appointment of the Governor is subject to the approval of the Secretary of State.

The law of the country is based on the Indian Penal, Criminal Procedure, and Civil Procedure Codes, with an adaptation in special instances of several of the Acts in force in the British colonies, and an Emau's court, for the administration of
Mahomedan law. There is a force of about 400 armed police under European officers. An European medical officer is attached to each residency.

Means of Communication.

A contract has been entered into with Messrs. Holt for regular communication by steamer between the local ports and Singapore and Hong Kong at least once in six weeks. There is frequent communication by steamer with Singapore and Hong Kong, and occasionally visits are made by steamers running between Hong Kong and Australia. There are no railways or telegraphs, and but few roads. Internal communication is mainly by water. The nearest point in telegraphic connection with Europe is Singapore.
