MISCELLANEOUS ISLANDS.

A number of islands and rocks throughout the world are British territory, or under British protection, but are not included in any Colony or separate Protectorate. Among such may be mentioned the Ashmore Group (Indian Ocean), Bird Island (Tasmania), Sydney Island (4° 25' S. lat., 171° 13' W. long.), the Caroline and Flint Islands (Pacific Ocean, 9° 56' S. lat., 150° 6' W. long., and 11° 26' S. lat. and 151° 48' W. long.), Malden Island (off the coast of Victoria, 4° 1' S. lat., 150° 57' W. long.), the Purdy Group (New Guinea), Sombrero (West Indies, with a Board of Trade Lighthouse costing 520l. annually) Cato Island, Raine Island, Bell Cay, Bramble Cay, Pilgrim Island, Ducie Island, Bauman Island, Roggewein Island, Teinhoven Island, Coral Island and Dudosa, Star-
buck Island, Little Scrub Island, Palmerston Island, Surprise Island, Vostoc, Willis's Islets (all in the Pacific Ocean), and there are many others. Most of these have no permanent inhabitants, but are, or have been, leased by the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury for guano collection, or for cocoanut planting. The rents are paid into the Exchequer.

The Cook or Hervey Islands, a group lying about 160° W. long. and 20° S. lat., were formally placed under British protection on 27th September, 1888. The principal island is Rarotonga (population 1,800; imports, 1888, about 1,500l.; exports, 13,500l.). There are three principal Queen rulers, Makea, Tinomana and Pa, who are also the chief landowners. The London Missionary Society has a training college at Avanua, and there are several trading firms, exporting fruit, copra, cotton, and coffee, principally to New Zealand. The chief other islands are Mangaia, 108 miles S.E. of Rarotonga, population 1,600; Atin, 106 miles north of Mangaia, population 850; Mitiaro (300); Manke (620); Mannae or Hervey Island, and Aitutaki (population 1,400). The total population of the group (which does not include Hull Island, or the Tubuai or Austral Islands) is about 9,000. Humphrey and Riorson Islands, and the Manihiki group, lying to the north of the Cook Islands, about 160° W. long. and 10° S. lat., were also annexed in 1888. Christmas, Fanning, and Penrhyn Islands were annexed in March, 1888, in view of the possibility of their being utilised in connection with the projected telegraph cable from Vancouver to Australasia. Christmas Island (1° 57' N. lat., 157° 27' W. long.) is an atoll 90 miles in circumference, barren, with only brackish water. A trading firm collects mother of pearl shells. Fanning Island (3° 51' N. lat., 159° 22' W. long.) is a small atoll 9 miles by 4, covered with cocoanut trees, copra and guano being exported. Penrhyn Island (9° S. lat., 158° 3' W. long.) is an atoll 30 miles in circumference, partly covered with cocoanut trees, and having a population of 300. Mother of pearl is exported. Suwarrow Island (13° 18' S. lat., 168° 9' W. long.) was annexed for a similar reason, 22nd April, 1888; a protectorate was established over Jarvis Island, Phoenix group (six islands), Union group (three islands), Washington or New York Island, and Palmyra Island.

The Mushalh Islands, a group of coral reefs on the coast of Abyssinia, were ceded by the Sultan of Tejureh, and taken possession of on the 31st August, 1840. By agreement with France in July, 1887, they were recognised as being under French protection, and they now belong to the French Colony of Jobock.

The Kurian-Muriyan Islands, five in number, off the south-east coast of Arabia, were ceded by the Imam of Muskat for the purpose of landing the Red Sea telegraph cable. On one of them, Hallamiyah, is the signalling station maintained by the Telegraph Company. The whole group is leased for the purpose of guano collection.
