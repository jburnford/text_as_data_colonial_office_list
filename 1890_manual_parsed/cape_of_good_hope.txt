CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.

Extent and Boundaries.

The Cape of Good Hope, strictly speaking, is a small promontory near the south-west extremity of the continent of Africa. But the extensive Colony of the name is bounded by the Atlantic and the Southern or Indian Oceans on the west and south; it is bounded on the north to the west of longitude 22° by the Orange River, on the northeast by the Orange Free State and Natal, and on the east by Pondoland. The Cape Colony with the Transkei contains an area of 217,895 square miles. It extends from 28 to 35 deg. S. lat., and from 17 to 80 deg. E. long.

In 1844 Letters Patent were issued annexing Natal to the Cape, but in 1856 it was constituted a separate Colony.

Twelve islands of Angra Pequena, on the coast of Damaraland (Plum-pudding, Roast-beef, Holland's Bird, Mercury, Ichaboe, Seal, Penguin, Halifax, Long, Possession, Albatross, and Mona), with the adjacent rocks, were annexed in 1867, and added to the Cape Colony in 1874.

In 1876 three large tracts of Kaffraria—namely, Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve, and Noman's Land, were brought under the more direct control of Government, and on the 12th of June, 1876, Letters Patent were issued authorising the Governor to annex these territories to the Cape of Good Hope, on condition of the Cape Parliament passing an Act to provide for their government. Such an Act was passed as No. 38 of 1877, but the territories were not actually incorporated until the 1st of October, 1879.

On the 12th March, 1878, the Port of Waiwich Bay, situated a few miles north of the tropic of Capricorn, was proclaimed British territory. It was annexed to the colony by proclamation dated 7th Aug., 1884.

On the 13th October, 1880, the Province of Griqualand West was incorporated with the Cape Colony.

Under Proclamation No. 13 of the 26th January, 1882, were issued certain laws and regulations for the government of the territories known respectively as Tembliland, Emigrant Tamboekieland, Bomvanaland, and Gcalekaland, of which by royal warrant dated the 14th November, 1881, the officer administering the government of the Cape of Good Hope was appointed governor. By Proclamation No. 140 of 26th August, 1885, issued under Act 3 of 1885, these territories were annexed to the Cape Colony. A similar warrant was passed on the
27th July, 1881, in respect to the St. John's River Territory, which was annexed to the Colony by Proclamation No. 215 of the 15th September, 1884.

The Xesibe country ("Mount Ayliff") was annexed to the Colony by Letters Patent of the 23rd August and Proclamation of 25th October, 1886, and the Rode Valley, Pondoland, by Letters Patent of 29th July, 1887, and Proclamation of —October, 1887 (Act No. 45 of 1887). Basutoland, now an independent colony, formed part of the Cape from 1871 to 1884.

History.

On 14th September, 1486, Bartholomew de Diaz, a Portuguese commander, landed in Algoa Bay. Vasco de Gama doubled the Cape 11 years later, from which time it appears to have been resorted to by European navigators of all nations, but chiefly by Portuguese, Dutch, and English. British ships visited the Cape in 1591, and about 1602 the Dutch made it a place of call. In 1620 two English East India Commanders, by a proclamation dated from Saldanha Bay, took possession of the Cape in the name of Great Britain; but no settlement was formed. In 1648 a Dutch East Indiaman, the "Haarlem," was wrecked in Table Bay, the crew remaining there some time. In 1652 J. A. Van Riebeeck, duly commissioned by the "Chamber of Seventeen" at Amsterdam, landed at Table Bay accompanied by 100 persons, and took possession of what is now the site of Cape Town on behalf of the Dutch East India Company. In 1671 the first formal purchase of land was made from the Hottentots, and another purchase took place in the following year. At the time of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes the European population received a slight addition of French Protestants, but their descendants have not maintained any distinctive position in the country. The rule of the Dutch East India Company proved very distasteful to the Burghers, who were continually prompted to move further and further from the seaboard and original seat of colonization. Following these migratory colonists a magistracy was established at Swellendam in 1745, and another at Graaff Reinet in 1786, and in 1788 the Great Fish River was proclaimed the boundary of the Colony. In 1795 Holland having yielded to the French Revolutionary Government, an English force proceeded to the Cape of Good Hope to secure it against the French for the Prince of Orange, but the Governor refused to obey the mandate of the Prince, and the British Force thereupon proceeded to take possession, upon which a capitulation was arranged, and the administration of the Government was assumed by General Craig. An Act of Parliament (37 Geo. III, c. 11) was passed to regulate the trade with the new possession. By the Peace of Amiens the Cape of Good Hope was restored to the Entavian Republic, and evacuated in 1803, but it was again captured by a British Force in 1806, and at the General Peace of 1814 it was ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown. During the interval between the Peace of Amiens and the recapture by the British in 1806, the Colony had made rapid progress owing to the abolition of the rule of the Dutch East India Company, and the wise regulations of government which had been substituted. An important event in the history of the Cape was the expulsion in 1809 of the Kaffirs from the Zuurveldt, a district west of the Great Fish River. In 1817 that district was visited by the then Governor, who saw the importance of its colonization as a barrier against the Kaffir power, and in 1820 Parliament voted a sum of 50,000l. to promote emigration to the Cape, and 4,000 British immigrants were brought to the Colony and settled in the eastern districts. In December, 1834, began the first of what are called the Kaffir wars, when the Gaika tribe, 20,000 strong, overran the whole south-eastern portion of the Colony, but were defeated and their lands up to the Kei River proclaimed British territory, but Lord Glenelg, then Secretary of State, refused to ratify the annexation. In 1846 the second Kaffir war broke out, but was speedily suppressed, and the colonial border was extended to the Kei River, as proposed by Sir Benjamin D'Urban. On Christmas Day, 1850, began the third Kaffir war, which lasted nearly three years, and in its earlier stages was aggravated by a simultaneous rebellion of the Kat River Hottentots.

In 1836 began what is called the trekking of a part of the Dutch or Boer population. This remarkable movement, which resulted in the colonization of Natal, the Free State, and the Transvaal, may be ascribed to several causes, of which the chief were:

1. General dislike of the policy of Great Britain in relation to slavery and the Native question.
2. Particular resentment against the policy of Lord Glenelg in reversing the policy of Sir Benjamin D'Urban in relation to the first Kaffir war.
3. Resentment against the mode in which compensation had been made to them for the loss of their slaves under the Imperial Act abolishing slavery, namely, by orders for payment payable in London, which they could only dispose of on the spot at an enormous discount.

The years 1849 and 1850 were years of continued excitement, owing to the proposals of the Government at home to send convicts to the Cape. In view of the agitation, carried almost to the point of active resistance, the project was abandoned. In 1856 the German Legion, which had been formed during the Crimean war, was brought to the Cape, and the men, numbering 2,300, disposed in selected spots on the frontier for defensive purposes. The same year (1856) was remarkable for the prevalence in Native Kaffraria of a cattle-killing delusion preached by a young prophetess, which resulted in wide-spread starvation. The political changes which have occurred in the last 20 years are briefly described under the title Constitution. One of the most important events in the recent economical and social history of the Cape has been the discovery of diamonds beyond the Orange River, which is described under the title Diamonds.

Climate.

The climate of the Cape is very favourable to Europeans. The air is dry and bracing, the heat never oppressive, and the winter weather mild and delightful; snow or ice are unknown except in the more elevated localities. The mean temperature at Royal Observatory, near Cape Town, is—maximum 72°4, minimum 52°8, and average rainfall for 5 years 28-63 inches. Alival N. (4330 ft. above sea), show 73°4 and 48°8 max. and min. resp., rainfall average for 4 years 22-77 inches.

In the Eastern division the chief rainfall is during the summer months (Nov. to Apr.), in the Western districts during the winter months.

Diseases of the lungs are rare, and there is a remarkable exemption from cholera, fevers, &c.

The Cape offers many localities presenting the requisites of altitude and extreme dryness for the modern treatment of consumptive patients.
Railways and Harbours.

The railways of the Colony consisted originally of three separate systems, the Western, Midland, and Eastern, having their starting points on the sea-board at Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and East London respectively. The Western and Midland systems are connected by a junction at De Aat (500 miles from Capetown and 340 from Port Elizabeth) and carried forward thence as one trunk line to Kimberley, the centre of the Diamond Fields (647 miles from Capetown and 485 from Port Elizabeth). This line was opened in 1885. A branch line runs to Colesberg, near the Orange Free State boundary. The Eastern system extends from East London, through Queen's Town, to Aliwal North, adjacent to the Basutoland and Orange Free State frontiers, and was opened in 1885. A branch extends to King William's Town, 42 miles from East London.

The lengths from Cape Town to Wellington, 64 miles, and from Cape Town to Wynberg, 8½ miles, became the property of the Government by purchase; the rest have been constructed, equipped, and maintained at the expense of the general revenue.

The Government mileage open for traffic in December, 1888, was 1,599 miles; the capital expended on purchase, construction, and equipment to that date being 14,214,308l. The gross receipts for 1888 were 1,451,416l., compared with 1,271,194l. for 1887; the working expenses were 756,060l., compared with 648,837l. in 1887, giving for 1888 a return of 4l. 17s. 10d. per cent. on the capital expenditure. Extension from Colesberg to Orange River (28 miles), on the Midland System, and Ecrete River to Sir Lowry's Pass (14 miles), on the Western System, are in course of construction; and further extensions from Orange River to Bloemfontein (117 miles), in the Orange Free State; Burgersdorp to Bethulie (39 miles), on the Eastern System; and Kalk Bay to Simon's Town (6 miles), on the Western System, are at present under consideration of Parliament.

The line between Grahamstown and Port Alfred (about 40 miles), which was constructed by a company subsidised by Government, was opened for traffic in 1883. During the session of 1888 powers were given to a company, to be also aided by a subsidy, to construct a branch from Worcester, on the Western Main Line, down the Breed River as far as Montagu, and this line is now open as far as Robertson. Parliament is also now considering the question of the purchase of these lines by the Government.

The Cape Copper Mining Company own and work a mineral line from Port Nolloth to Ookiep (93 miles) in the north-western part of the Colony.

The total length of railway in the Colony is accordingly about 1,745 miles.

Harbour Works on an extensive scale are being constructed at Cape Town, Port Alfred, Port Elizabeth, and East London.

At Cape Town and Port Elizabeth the works are under the direction of local boards, composed of elective and nominee members. At Port Alfred and East London they are controlled by the Public Works Department of the Government.

The cost of the works at Table Bay, to the 31st December, 1888, was for the breakwater, docks, &c., 1,435,737l.

The breakwater is now being carried out to a length of some 1,283 yards, the portion already completed being 3,249 feet. The graving dock, named the Robinson Dry Dock, was opened for use in 1882. Its length is 539-6 feet, and it is capable of taking ironclads and vessels of the very largest class likely to be sent out to these waters. The cost was 156,689l. It is constructed throughout of colonial granite.

Extensive additions to the Harbour Works of Table Bay have been authorised, and are in course of construction, comprising an outer harbour, formed in part by the existing breakwater, and its extension, and a south arm running parallel with it, which will enclose an area of 64 acres, in addition to the inner docks, with a depth ranging from 24 to 36 feet at low water.

The works constructed at Port Elizabeth were two iron pile jetties, each nearly 900 feet long, which have much facilitated the landing and shipping of passengers and goods; an iron bridge over the Baakens River, and two retaining banks, and the removal of the old wooden jetties, and the old breakwater and shield. The total expenditure was 497,757l.

At East London and at Port Alfred, at the mouths of the Buffalo and Kowie Rivers, the attempt made to overcome the obstructions of the sand-bars which close the entrances, by the construction of training-walls intended to have the effect of removing the bar by the natural scouring of the stream, has resulted in increased depths of water and general improvement. The employment of a powerful steam pump hopper dredger at East London has been attended with highly satisfactory results in opening the entrance channel. To the 30th June, 1889, there had been expended at East London 570,597l., and at Port Alfred 236,250l.

Diamonds.

The diamond fields of South Africa are situated in the territory known as Griqualand West, which became British territory by cession from the Griqua people in 1871, and remained a separate colony until October, 1880, when it was annexed to the Cape Colony.

The first diamond was found by accident, in 1867, and passed through many hands before its value was suspected. Even when it was admitted to be a diamond, doubts were thrown on its origin, nothing like an organized or systematic examination of the country was made for a long time.

A few diamonds, however, continued to be found, and in the year 1870 an exploring party, chiefly composed of officers of the 20th Regiment, then stationed at Natal, and another of Cape Colonists from King William's Town, proceeded to dig and wash the alluvial drift along the banks of the Vaal River. They soon found diamonds, and their success brought numerous other parties from all parts of the neighbouring Colonies and Republics. Operations were at this time confined to the river banks, which for many miles were covered with mining camps.

In 1871, however, the discovery was made that diamonds existed not only in the drift of the old river-bed near the present course of the Vaal, but in the loose red surface-sand covering the flat grassy country between that river and the Modder, a smaller stream which ultimately joins the Vaal. A vigorous, if not systematic, search soon resulted in the opening of the Mines now being worked at and close to Kimberley, and the river banks were soon almost deserted for the more profitable Dry Diggings, where diamonds were found in unexampled profusion.

The River Diggings, which still support a
population of between 3,000 and 4,000, extend along the Vaal River, principally on the right bank from above Hebron to its junction with the Hart at Delsport Hope. The mines at present worked at Kimberley, De Beers, Du Toits Pan, and Bultfontein. St. Augustine's Mine also figures to a small extent in the production returns.

The following tables give the total quantity and value of the production and export of Diamonds during the past five years:

| Production. |
|-------------|
| 1884. | 1885. | 1886. | 1887. | 1888. |
| Carats. | Carats. | Carats. | Carats. | Carats. |
| £2,222,666 | £2,814,255 | £3,091,807 | £3,692,265 | £3,666,071 |
| £2,614,108 | £2,294,780 | £3,345,447 | £4,128,288 | £2,658,888 |

| Exports. |
|----------|
| Carats. | Carats. | Carats. | Carats. | Carats. |
| £2,268,606 | £2,439,720 | £3,135,061 | £3,598,920 | £3,841,987 |
| £2,907,288 | £2,489,559 | £3,504,755 | £4,251,470 | £4,022,379 |

(a) Exclusive of River Diggings.

During 1887-8-9 steps were taken towards the amalgamation of rival interests in the principal mines, notably Kimberley and De Beers. At these two mines, where the depth has enhanced the difficulty and danger of open workings, operations are now mostly confined to underground working by means of shaft and tunnel. The area of the Kimberley Mine at the surface is about 23 acres, and of De Beers about 29 acres; Du Toits Pan is somewhat larger than De Beers, while Bultfontein is the smallest of the four principal mines. The assessed value of the claim ground in 1887 was £1,159,040., and 1,929 white and 11,361 coloured persons were employed in the mines.

Minerals, &c.

Cape coal from the Stormberg on the northeastern frontier is now exclusively used on the eastern system of railways, with a great saving of cost. Its use on the rest of the Colonial railways, at present hampered by the cost of transport, only awaits the construction of the junction line between the Eastern and the Midland systems. This coal is used freely for household purposes at Queenstown, and in other places in the neighbourhood of the fields. The output from the mines during 1888 is estimated at 32,820 tons.

Mining operations on a large scale are carried on in the division of Namaqualand, where extensive copper deposits exist.

The output from the mines during 1888 was 34,712 tons of ore, the quantity exported being 40,023 tons, valued at £56,803.

Between the mine and the seaport (Port Nolothi), a distance of 93 miles, a railway of 2ft. 6in. gauge has been laid by the enterprising Company named, at a cost of no less than £58,000.

The development of the Knysna Gold Fields is steadily progressing. The yield to the 31st December, 1888, is estimated at 1,104 ounces of gold.

Guano is found in large quantities on the various islets along the coast; and the collection and exportation of it forms a very remunerative industry. The leases of these islands bring in an annual rental of from £0,024.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, and this is also the money of account, and practically the only coin in circulation throughout South Africa. The Colonial Government does not issue notes, but all the banks do so, the issue not being a legal tender.

The banking system is well developed, there being 10 banks, with 76 separate branches, in 51 different towns and villages.

The principal banks are the Standard Bank of South Africa, Limited (48 branches), and the Bank of Africa, Limited (8 branches), and there are eight other banks, viz., Cape of Good Hope, Union, Natal, Kaffrarian Colonial, Paarl, Wellington, Western Province, and Worcester Commercial, with together 20 branches.

The total amount of notes in circulation on the 30th of June, 1889, was £835,674l., and the amount of deposits £9,078,799l.

Post Office savings banks were established in 1884; on 30th June, 1889, there was £10,234l. deposited, to the credit of 16,650 depositors. The interest allowed is 3½ per cent.

Number of branches 154.

Industries.

The colonists at the Cape are chiefly employed in the production of wool, wine, wheat, barley, oats, tobacco and maize, and in the breeding of horses, cattle, goats ostriches, and sheep. The wheat of this Colony is not surpassed in quality by any grown elsewhere. Valuable forests cover large areas, and are extensively worked. Those reserved to the Crown cover an estimated area of about 250,000 acres. They are controlled by the Department of Woods and Forests, at an annual charge of some £10,000. The attention of the Government has recently been given to the economical and systematic working of the Crown Forests with anticipated satisfactory results. The chief exports are diamonds, wool, copper ore, ostrich feathers, gold, mohair, hides and skins. The chief imports are textiles, leather, sugar, coffee, hardware, explosives, and machinery. 95 per cent. of the exports go to the United Kingdom, which sends 78 per cent. of the imports; the rest of the trade is with South Australia, Natal, Brazil, the United States, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Mauritius, and India.

The wine exported in 1888 amounted to 107,000 gallons, valued at £20,000.

Ostrich breeding is not now carried on so largely as heretofore. Artificial incubation of ostrich eggs has been successfully introduced in many districts.

In 1860, the export of ostrich feathers was 2,287 lbs.; ten years later it was 28,768 lbs., while in 1888 it amounted to 259,967 lbs.

The exports of mohair at corresponding dates were respectively:- 385 lbs., 403,153 lbs., and 9,598,768 lbs. The export of wool had risen from 23,172,785 lbs. in 1860, to 48,822,562 lbs. in 1871, and stood at 66,353,699 lbs. in 1888, the maximum reached.

A department of agriculture was established in 1887, and successful efforts are being made to eliminate contagious diseases among cattle, to improve the breeds of sheep and horses, and the cultivation of wine and tobacco. A Government model wine farm is maintained at Constantia. It is intended to establish agricultural schools at the more important agricultural centres.

From estimates made by direction of Government, it appears that the following quantities of grain in 1889 were reaped in the Colony and
the Transkei, viz.: Wheat, 8,659,780; barley, 863,259; rye, 437,701; oats, 1,595,182; mealies, 2,716,952 bushels.

Capetown, East London, and Port Elizabeth are ports of registry, having on 31st December, 1888, 34 vessels registered, of together 3,643 tons.

Education.

To promote elementary instruction of all children, industrial training for native lads and girls, and superior instruction to those preparing for the University examinations, the Government gives grants of money in aid of salaries of lecturers and professors (under the Higher Education Act), and of other teachers under Act 13 of 1865, assistance in providing furniture and allowances in aid of expenses of needy boarders at schools amongst the agricultural population. There were in March, 1889; 417 undenominational public schools, 67 district boarding schools and departments, 309 private farm schools, 16 circuit teacher's schools, 427 mission schools, 8 special institutions, 27 aborigines' schools, Colonial, 95 aborigines' schools, Transkei, 44 aborigines' schools, Tembuland, 56 aborigines' schools, Griqualand East, in all 1,473 institutions and schools. The daily attendance was 49,759. There are also 4 colleges with 247 students. The Government expenditure was 93,418l. in 1887-88, and the local expenditure 102,929l.

The Education Department is under the direction of the Superintendent-General of Education, aided by a staff of inspectors. The local elected boards guarantee half the teachers' salaries, and provide accommodation. There is no school tax.

Under Act No. 16 of 1873 was established the University of the Cape of Good Hope, whose power to confer the degrees of B.A., M.A., LL.B., L.L.D., M.B., and M.D. has been recognised by Her Majesty under Letters Patent dated 8th August, 1877.

The Council consists of 20 members. The University is aided by a Government grant, and its revenue is supplemented by endowments, &c. The following table shows the number of persons who—

| Matriculated | Inter. Exam. Took direct | Were admitted | ad cundem |
|--------------|--------------------------|---------------|-----------|
| 1884         | 118                      | 20            | 12        | 7         |
| 1885         | 118                      | 23            | 12        | 17        |
| 1886         | 121                      | 53            | 18        | 6         |
| 1887         | 122                      | 25            | 17        | 14        |
| 1888         | 138                      | 43            | 31        | 3         |
| 1889         | 109                      | 31            | 14        |           |

In connection with the University, school examinations are held annually. 4,800 candidates have passed the elementary, and 752 the higher examinations, since 1875.

There are 6 newspapers published daily, 7 thrice a week, 10 twice, 36 once, and 1 monthly.

Sea and Land Communications.

The Colony is in telegraphic communication with Europe, via Capetown, by the Western cable, and via Natal, by the Zanzibar and Aden cable. The telegraph system is well developed, there being now 9,601 miles open, erected by the Government at a cost of 368,328l.; the gross receipts in 1888 being 70,242l., and the expenditure 49,087l.

The packets of the Union Steamship Company and the Castle Mail Packets Company, under contracts with the Colonial Government, leave England weekly on Fridays, and the Cape (Table Bay) on Wednesdays, the passage to be effected in 20½ days, and in 20½ days when the steamer is required to touch at St. Helena. The average passage is 19 days. The distance by sea from England to the Cape varies from 5,866 to 6,146 miles, according to the course followed. The packets call at Lisbon on the outward voyages to take up the English and continental supplementary mails, and at either Lisbon or Madeira on the homeward passages.

Steamers leave Table Bay weekly for Natal calling at Mossel Bay, Port Elizabeth, and East London, to land and embark passengers; they usually leave about 24 hours after the arrival of the English mail.

The passage to Port Elizabeth takes two days, East London three, and to Natal four to five days.

A "Castle" Company's steamer leaves Table Bay once a month for Delagoa Bay, and ports on the East Coast of Africa; and that Company also sends a steamer once every six weeks to Mauritius and Madagascar. The "Union" Company extend their Natal service to Delagoa Bay once every fortnight.

Communication is effected between Cape Town and the chief inland towns daily, with Natal once a week, via the Transkei, with the Orange Free State twice a week, and with the Transvaal daily through Kimberley. The direct route for the Transvaal English mail is through Cape Town and the Diamond Fields. Transit between England and Johannesburg and Pretoria by this route 23 days.

The number of Colonial post offices is 635, and of money order offices, 162. The expenditure on the postal service in 1878 amounted to 63,297l., and to 222,294l. 6s. 7d. in 1888; the revenue in 1873 was 41,478l., and the commission on money orders 902l.; the corresponding figures for 1888 were 215,158l. 12s. 2d. and 7,147l. 6s. 2d. The weight of registered packets addressed to England, and supposed to contain diamonds, which passed the Post Office in the year 1888, amounted to 2,597 lbs. 8 oz.

Population and Chief Towns.

The population of the whole Colony (excluding Basutoland, but including Griqualand and the Transkeian territories) was estimated at the end of 1888 at 1,428,729 persons. Of these about 350,000 are of European descent, the remainder being coloured or native races, comprising Kaffirs, Fingoes, Hottentots, Bushmen, and Malays. The Europeans are mainly of Dutch, English, or Huguenot descent, with some Germans and Portuguese. In the Ecclesiastical Returns for 1888, 196,000 are returned as belonging to the Dutch Reformed Church, 110,000 as Wesleyans, and 65,000 as Anglicans.

Cape Town, which had in 1875 a population of 33,239, and with suburbs, 45,240, had at the end of 1888 an estimated population of 41,704. The population of Cape Town and suburbs (connected by rail and trams) exceeds 64,000 in the townships alone.

Kimberley had a population of 28,663; Beaconfield, 21,619; Port Elizabeth, 15,926; Graham's Town, 8,278; King William's Town, 5,356; Paarl, 6,447; Graaff Reinet, 5,622; Worcester, 4,684; Queenstown, 2,520; East London, 5,908; Stellenbosch, 5,055; Uitenhage, 5,204, according to the estimate census of 1889.

Constitution.

The Government of the Cape from 1806 to 1835 was administered by a Governor, aided by a few Executive Officers; but in that year an Executive
Council, and a Legislative Council, appointed by the Crown, comprising certain office-holders and some unofficial members, were created.

By Letters Patent, dated 23rd May, 1850, the Governor and Council were empowered to enact Ordinances for the establishment of a Representative Government; three years later, that form of Government was brought into force. By an Act of the Colonial Legislature passed in the session of 1872, the introduction of the system of Responsible Government, that is the conduct of the Executive Government by the advice of Ministers responsible to the Local Parliament, was pronounced advisable, and the Royal Assent to the measure was given by an Order in Council dated the 9th August, 1872. The first Ministry under Responsible Government was formed in November, 1872.

There is a Legislative Council of 22 elected Members, presided over, ex officio, by the Chief Justice, and a House of Assembly of 76 elected Members, representing the country districts and towns of the Colony, including the Transkeian territories. The Colonial Ministers are the Colonial Secretary, the Treasurer-General (who is Premier), the Attorney-General, the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Public Works, and the Secretary for Native Affairs, all of whom are Members of the Legislature, and also have seats in the Executive Council, of which the Governor is President. The session lasts usually from May to August.

Act No. 18 of 1874 provided for the division of the Colony into seven electoral provinces, each electing three members for the Legislative Council for seven years. Under the Griqualand West Annexation Act 39 of 1877, a Member is added to the Council for that province. The qualification for Members is possession of immovable property of £2,000, or movable property worth £4,000. With the exception of paid office-holders (other than the Ministers), and others specified in the Order in Council, any person may be elected a Member of Assembly. Members of both Houses are elected by the same voters, who are qualified by possession of property, or receipt of salary or wages, of not less than £50 per annum, or not less than £25, with board and lodging. The number of registered electors in 1888 was 70,300. The Registration Act No. 14 of 1887 makes a better provision for the machinery of registration and for the exclusion of unqualified persons, especially those whose only qualification is a share in tribal occupancy.

By an Act No. 5 of 1875, the Ecclesiastical Endowments provided by the Civil List Ordinance of 1852, were abolished prospectively, the life interests of incumbents being respected.

The supreme court, as consolidated by Act No. 40, of 1882, consists of one Chief Justice and eight Puisne Judges; three of whom are assigned to the Court of the Eastern Districts, and three to the High Court of Griqualand. Within the jurisdiction of the Court of the Eastern Districts fall territories known as Transkei, Griqualand, and Tembuland.

The Judges of the "Supreme Court" hold Sessions in Cape Town, and Circuit Courts in the Western Districts, the Judges of "The Eastern Districts Court," hold Sessions in Grahamstown, and Circuit Courts in the principal towns of the Eastern Districts, and Transkei, and the Judges of the High Court holds session at Kimberley.

The Roman Dutch Law prevails in the Colony as modified by Colonial Legislation. A "Native Territories Penal Code" came into operation for the Transkei, Griqualand East, Tembuland, and Port St. John's on 1st January, 1887.

Local Government.

Divisional Councils were first established in the year 1865; they then exercised authority over branch roads only, and performed certain functions in connection with district schools, pounds and crown lands. They have now been relieved of all duties in regard to schools and lands, but with these exceptions their powers and functions have been gradually increased and amplified. The councils are elected triennially, and consist of eight elective members exclusive of the Civil Commissioner as chairman, excepting in the Cape Division, which returns ten members. The electors are the registered parliamentary voters, and the qualifications of members are registration as voters and registered ownership of immovable property in the division valued at not less than £500. The maintenance of all roads now rests with the councils, and they have also important duties to discharge in regard to disputed land boundaries and beacons; can nominate Field Cornets; may borrow money on the security of rates for the prosecution of local public works; may promote the establishment of a Divisional Police Force, on payment to Government of one-third of the cost of such force; and return three members annually to the District Licensing Court. The revenue of these councils is derived from toll fees, pound sales, and road rates. They are 63 in number, and their receipts during the year 1888 amounted to £116,063, of which £10,950 was borrowed money for public works. Payments for the same period amounted to £124,370. The accounts are subject to audit by two auditors elected triennially by the registered voters of the division, and also to a final audit by the Controller and Auditor-General of the Colony.

Municipalities were first established by an ordinance in 1836. In 1882 an Act was passed consolidating and amending all laws then existing in regard to these boards. Every municipality is governed by a council, composed of a mayor or chairman, and councillors, numbering not less than 6 nor more than 24, a certain number of which are elected annually by the ratepayers. Town councils or municipalities have power to levy annually a landlord's or owner's rate, assessed upon the value of rateable property, and a tenant's rate assessed upon the annual value of such property; no rate to exceed 2d. in the £ on the value, or 8d. in the £ on the annual value, excepting in Capetown, where a landlord's rate of 3d. may be levied.

All mayors or chairmen are members of District Licensing Courts. There are 80 municipalities in the Colony, whose receipts from all sources during the year 1888 amounted to £306,057, which includes £68,909, borrowed money for public works. Payments during the same period amounted to £307,451. The Controller and Auditor-General has no control over municipal accounts.

Village management boards, of which there are 53 in the Colony, exist chiefly in hamlets which are not entrusted with full municipal privileges. The Act of 1881, under which these boards were established, may be proclaimed to be in force upon petition of the inhabitants. There are 3 members elected annually by the voters registered for Parliamentary purposes, who shall be resident within the area defined by proclamation. These boards have no power to levy rates; this is done for them by the divisional council at their request, to an amount not exceeding 3d. in the £ within the limits of the village boards' jurisdiction. The powers and duties of these boards are of the same nature as, although in most respects more restricted...
than, those of municipalities. Their revenues amounted in 1887-8 to £3,883l. 10s.

**Defence.**

There is an extensive Admiralty establishment at Simon's Bay, and to defend this Naval station an Imperial garrison of 1,300 men is usually stationed at Cape Town and Wynberg. The defence of the Colony from native attacks has, however, devolved since 1871 upon the Colonial forces. These now consist of the Cape Police (642 strong) and the Cape Mounted Rifles (819 strong, with two field guns), which are permanently embodied and paid. There are also 30 Volunteer Corps, of all arms, numbering 4,364 men (with 11 guns), maintained by a capitation grant. Table Bay is being strongly fortified at the joint expense of the War Office and the Colonial Government.

**Dependent Territories.**

**Basutoland,** which formed a portion of the Cape Colony from August, 1871, down to 1884, is now an independent territory, administered by a Resident Commissioner under the instructions of Her Majesty's High Commissioner in South Africa, who also holds the office of Governor of the Cape Colony. Accounts of Basutoland, as well as of British Bechuanaland, which is in nearly the same political position, will be found under those headings.

**The Northern Border.**—Early in 1878, while the war with the Amakosa was being carried on, a number of Koranas, Griquas, Kaffirs, and others living along the Orange River, took up arms against the Colony, their object being simply plunder. It was difficult to move a military force to such a remote quarter, and it was more than a year before the insurrection could be suppressed. A magistrate, with a body of police, was then stationed at Upington, on the northern bank of the Orange. Since this date there have been no further disturbances. The northern border establishment was broken up, and the special Commissioner recalled, on 30th June, 1888. The territory now forms the "Gordonia" district of British Bechuanaland.

**Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve, and Noman's Land,** as explained in Par. 1 of this Article, were annexed to the Cape in October, 1879.

In 1877 the Gcalekasi, a tribe residing beyond the Kei, under Kreli, one of the leaders of the great Kaffir war of 1850-53, defied the authority of the British Government, and invaded what is now British territory. They were, however, defeated by the Colonial forces under the immediate leadership of Colonel C. D. Griffith, C.M.G., then Commandant of the Frontier Armed and Mounted Police. Their territory was overrun, and Kreli deposed, and his country taken as British in October, 1877.

In 1875-76 the Tembus, of Tembuland proper, gave themselves over to the Government, and in 1878 the Bomvanas did the same.

While giving effect to the desire of these tribes to come under the Cape Government, it was also arranged to include in the same scheme of incorporation Gcalekaland and a settlement of native British subjects called the Emigrant Tembus.

They are governed by officials paid by the Cape Government, and under its supervision.

The above-named territories, viz., Tembuland, Emigrant Tembuland, Bomvanaland, and Gcaleka-

land, were formally proclaimed British territory in November, 1881, and in 1885 they were annexed to the Cape Colony.

In 1885 the Chief Kreli requested to be placed on the same footing as the others, and was located in Bomvanaland, on a tract of land purchased from the Chief of the Bomvanas, Pall, chief of the Amatsheni, who had previously been living in practical independence in Lower Tembuland, formally tendered his submission to Colonial rule in 1886, and he and his people were registered in the same manner as the Tembus.

The Pondoinsi tribe, under the chiefs Um-ditshwa and Umblonhlo, and some of the most powerful clans, allied with the Tembu tribe, took up arms against the Colony at the outbreak of the Basuto rebellion. The Tembus proper aided the Colony. The insurrection was suppressed, and a re-settlement of the lands previously occupied by the insurgents effected, by which greater security in the future is promised.

Under a Proclamation of Sir Bartle Frere, dated the 4th September, 1878, Umgikela (died 1887), for breach of treaty arrangements, ceased to be recognized as paramount chief of the Pondois, and the sovereignty of the port and estuary of St. John's River was vested in Her Majesty's Government. A Resident was appointed to represent the Government with Umgikela, who remains Chief of East Pondoland. The Cape Colony customs dues are levied at St. John's River mouth, under a Proclamation dated 2nd August, 1881. The port was annexed to the Colony in 1884. Umgikela died in October, 1887, and in February, 1888, his son Sigcawu was elected to succeed him. A Resident Commissioner in Pondoland was appointed on 6th July, 1888.

**West Pondoland** is under the Chief Nquiliso. A small strip of his territory at the mouth of the St. John's River was acquired by the Cape Government for £1,000.

The district of Mount Aylif, or the Xesibe country, after having long been administered as a dependency of Griqualand East, was formally annexed to the Colony in October, 1886, and the Rode Valley in October, 1887.

The whole of the natives in these territories are now subject to Colonial rule (except East Pondoland, over which there is a British protectorate).

They are now re-grouped, under three Chief Magistrates, with several subordinate magistrates, in the following manner, viz.:

Griqualand East, under one Chief Magistrate, Mr. W. E. Stanford, and nine subordinate magistrates. It has a population of 2,935 Europeans and 98,000 natives; revenue in 1888, £28,293l. 19s.; expenditure, £21,059l. 0s. 8d.

Tembuland, comprising Tembuland proper, Bomvanaland, and Emigrant Tembuland, all under one Chief Magistrate, Major Elliot, C.M.G., and seven subordinate magistrates. Major Elliot has also charge of the relations of the Government with Pondoland West. It has a population of 5,619 Europeans and 125,000 natives; revenue in 1888, £21,811l. 14s.; expenditure, £19,884l. 4s. 6d.

Transkei, comprising Fingoland, the Idutywa Reserve, Gcalekaland, all under one Chief Magistrate, and six subordinate magistrates. It has a population of 876 Europeans and 123,000 natives; revenue in 1888, £17,932l. 18s. 8d.; expenditure, £15,553l. 10s. 3d.
