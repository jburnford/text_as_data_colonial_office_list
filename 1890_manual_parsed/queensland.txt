QUEENSLAND.

Situation and Area.

Queensland occupies the whole of the north-eastern portion of Australia, commencing at a point of the east coast called Point Danger, in lat. 28° 8' south, about 400 miles north of Sydney, the capital of New South Wales.

The greater portion of the southern boundary line is formed by the 29th parallel of south latitude. The eastern seaboard extends about 1,500 miles, from Point Danger to Cape York, the extreme northern point of the continent, in lat. 10° 40'. Thursday Island, in Torres Straits, with Moreton, Stradbroke, Fraser, Hinchinbrook, Prince of Wales, Wellesley, and many other islands, are included in the Colony.

The breadth of the territory near the southern boundary is about 900 miles, from the eastern coast line to the meridian of 188° east longitude, which forms the western boundary line of the Colony, separating it from the territory of South Australia. This includes the greater part of the Gulf of Carpentaria, which has a seaboard of about 750 miles. The whole of the Colony of Queensland comprises 668,437 square miles, or 427,888,060 acres.

History.

Captain Cook landed in Moreton Bay in 1770, but the Brisbane River, running into Moreton Bay, was not discovered until 1828, and the Moreton Bay Settlement was formed from New South Wales in 1824. The Darling Downs were explored in 1828, and squatters began to settle on the rich pasture grounds. The territory was however not thrown open to colonisation until 1842, and, after explorations by Leichhardt, 1845-7, and by Kennedy in York Peninsula in 1847, it was separated from New South Wales on 10th December, 1859, when it became a separate colony, under the name of Queensland, with about 25,000 inhabitants, having responsible government from the first.

Physical Features.

The climate is comparable to that of Madeira, the mean temperature being high but constant. The northern part is tropical. The mean temperature at Brisbane is 65°, the extreme range being from 35° to 106°. The rainfall in the interior is scanty and variable; the mean at Brisbane is about 35 inches, mostly from Nov. to May.

The country extending along the eastern seaboard is indented with several fine bays and estuaries, which are the outlets of rivers, a number of which are navigable for good sized vessels.

A mountain range, called the "Main," or "Great Dividing Range," extends throughout the greater portion of the Colony; it is a continuation of the main range, or Cordillera of New South Wales and Victoria, and runs north to about the 21st parallel of south latitude, and thence west to the western boundary. Another range branches from the main range about lat. 21° south and long. 145° east, and traverses the northern peninsula to its termination at Cape York, the most northerly point of the continent of Australia. Between this range and the eastern shore are situated the highest mountains in the country, viz., the Bellenden Kerr Range, which reach an elevation of over 5,000 feet above the sea level.

Products and Industries.

Between the main range and the sea, especially on the banks of the rivers, there is a considerable quantity of good alluvial land, which in its natural state is covered with a dense growth of timber. Much of this, in the more settled portions of the country, has been cleared and cultivated, and is found to yield a remunerative return to the farmers, who are usually small proprietors, cultivating the soil principally with their own labour, and growing chiefly sugar, maize, English and sweet potatoes, arrowroot, and semi-tropical fruits.

Sugar growing has now become a very important industry. In 1886 there were 47,340 acres under cane, of which 32,375 acres were crushed, yielding a return of 84,659 tons of sugar.

Maize was grown on 85,966 acres, and returned a yield of 2,181,681 bushels.

In 1888 the quantity of land under arrowroot was 149 acres, which yielded 254,870 lbs.

Much of the country to the west of the dividing range of mountains is elevated table-land consisting of wide plains, almost devoid of timber, but well grassed and watered. Within a certain distance of the mountains where the rainfall is tolerably regular, much of the land is well adapted for the production of wheat. This is cultivated in the neighbourhood of Toowoomba and Warwick, on the Darling Downs. In 1888 9,602 acres were planted with this cereal, principally in the localities mentioned. Out of the total area planted the produce of 198 acres was mown for hay, and 9,805 acres yielded 8,263 bushels of grain.

Grazing is far in advance of tillage farming in the Colony, and there are 6,886 squatting "runs" or tracts of land, containing 457,738 sq. miles, leased from the Government at a very low annual rental, in the Colony, more than half the number of which are surveyed.

The chief exports are wool, 2,258,865l.; gold, 1,662,689l.; sugar, 384,419l.; livestock, 902,444l.; tin, 280,360l.; silver, 119,020l.; and hides and skins, 112,729l. The imports are textiles, alcohol, tea, flour, hardware, and machinery. Nearly all of the external trade is with the United Kingdom and the other Australasian colonies; what little is done elsewhere is principally with Hong Kong, China, and the United States.

The Gympie and Charters Towers gold fields still maintain large mining populations, and the yield from their reefs, although satisfactory, is not so favourable as would be the case if more scientific appliances were available for the extraction of the metal. During the year 1884 an important discovery of gold was made near Rockhampton, at a place called Mount Morgan. The find is undoubtedly a very rich one; but, being on private and not on Crown land, it is difficult to obtain reliable information as to the actual yield. The geological character of this gold field is peculiar, the gold being found in a frothy porous sinter, so light that it floats in the water like pumice, and the fine gold is disseminated throughout the sinter which is supposed to have been deposited by a ther-
mal spring. Another important discovery was made during the year 1880 in tin mining at Herberton, in the Cardwell district. The returns are very good, and already a large and apparently permanent township has sprung up in the locality. There are lead mines in operation at Ravenswood, the ore from which yields a good percentage of silver. There are also large deposits of gold in the district. Cinnabar, antimony, and manganese are also among the mineral products. Another important gold field was recently discovered in the Gulf watershed, and a large mining township named Croydon has sprung up, believed to contain a population of about 5,000.

Useful timbers of various descriptions grow in abundance in Queensland, and ought to become a valuable export. The timber indigenous to the Colony is generally divided into two classes, termed respectively "hard" and "soft" woods. The undermentioned trees supply the hardwood, which is most in demand: flooded gum, iron bark, blackbut, turpentine, stringy bark, spotted gum, bloodwood, beech, yellow wood, dark yellow wood, &c., &c. Some of these woods are especially valuable for railway making, bridge, pier, and wharf building, as well as for fencing purposes, on account of their strength and durability. The timbers, which are used for house and boat building, cabinet and ornamental work, have a fine grain, are easily worked, and take a bright polish; a few of those most in use are as follows: red cedar, Moreton Bay pine, Kauri pine, cypress pine, she pine, silky oak, satin wood, &c., &c.

Amongst the medicinal plants supplying extracts and preparations which are attracting notice in both Europe and America, may be mentioned—Duboisia myoporoides, the extract of which is in demand as a substitute for belladonna; Aletonia constricta, whose bark is a valuable tonic; Euphorbia Drummondii, the extract of which is effective in dysentery and low fever; Euphorbia pilulifera, or the asthma herb; and the lemon-leaved iron bark which, on distillation, yields an essential oil equal to that of the lemon. The extract from leaves of the Eucalyptus is coming largely into favour as a remedy for colds, fevers, &c.

Excellent coal has already been found in some localities, and new discoveries are being frequently made. There were 311,412 tons of this mineral raised during 1888, valued at £27,947l. At Burrun, in the Maryborough district, splendid coal has been discovered, and a railway constructed to the spot, in order to bring the mineral to the Port of Maryborough.

Brisbane, Maryboro, Rockhampton, and Townsville are ports of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1888, 197 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 18,700.

Population.

The population of Queensland, excluding the aborigines, was found by the return of the census of April, 1881, to be 213,525 persons; a census was taken on the 1st of May, 1886, when it was found that the total population was 322,553 persons, an increase of 51·20 per cent. in 5 years, and the estimated population on 31st December, 1888, was 387,463, including Chinese, 9,169; Polynesians, 8,200; other alien races, 1,447. The balance of the population are either Australasian born or of European parentage. This does not include the aborigines, of whom there are believed to be about 70,000 in the Colony.

There are above 280 inhabited towns and town reserves. Of these 28 are under Municipal Government, and contain a population of about 140,101. The receipts of the local authorities in 1888 were £48,540l.; their expenditure £42,963l.; the assessed annual value of the property in the districts under their control £2,296,901l., and debt £590,521l., in addition to debts for water works amounting to £87,619l.

Brisbane, the capital of the Colony, is beautifully situated on the fine river of that name about 20 miles from the mouth. The city, including its suburbs, has a population of about 80,000. It is only about 10 miles in a direct line from the sea coast, and the climate during the greater part of the year is healthy and enjoyable.

The other chief towns are Townsville (12,000), Ipswich (11,000), Maryborough (12,500), Rockhampton (12,819), Toowoomba (6,300).

Currency and Banking.

There were, on 21st December, 1888, 11 banks, with 189 branches. The value of the coin and bullion is given as £2,100,864l.; deposits, £1,201,189l.; note circulation, £40,920l. The Government Savings Bank returns the number of depositors as 43,003, the amount of deposits as £1,611,876l.

The currency and legal tender is exclusively British sterling.

Means of Communication.

At the end of 1888 the railways in Queensland showed 1,931 miles in operation, the cost of construction being £13,064,598l., the revenue being £76,734l., and the working expenses £507,961l. There were 681 miles of railway authorised or in course of construction. The following lines are now open for traffic:—The Southern and Western from Brisbane to Charleville; with its branches, Ipswich to Dugandan, Ipswich to Esk, Toowoomba via Warwick and Stanthorpe to the New South Wales border at Wallangarra, Toowoomba to Crowe Nest, Toowoomba to Pittsworth, and a branch from Warwick to Killarney. A main coast line is now open southwards, Brisbane to Nerang, with a branch to Southport, northwards, Brisbane to Caboolture, with a branch to Sandgate. There is a line open to Gympie, with a branch to Kilkivan, and one also to Bundaberg from Maryborough. In the latter district the line is open from the township of that name to Mount Perry, a great copper mining centre.

The Central Railway is open from Rockhampton to Barcaldine, with branches to Springsure and Clermont.

From Mackay, a port between Rockhampton and Townsville, 28 miles of railway are open to Mirani, with a branch to Eton opening up good agricultural land.

The Northern Railway is open from Townsville to Hughenden, with a branch to Ravenswood, having been carried past Charters Towers, the latter town a great gold mining centre, having a population of about 10,000 inhabitants. From all the above railways several fresh branches are being constructed tending to open up the Colony. The trunk lines all start from the head of navigable rivers on the eastern seaboard. In the Cook and Carpentaria Division a railway is being constructed to connect Cooktown with the Palmer Gold Fields, 51 miles of which are open for traffic. Another railway is also in course of
construction from Cairns, on the sea coast, to Herberton, the great tin mining centre, of which 8 miles are open for traffic. A line is also under construction from Normanton, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, towards Croydon, south-easterly, the first section of which has just been opened.

There are 311 electric telegraph stations in the Colony. The number of miles of line 9,167, with 16,648 miles of wire. The receipts were 103,790l., and expenditure 108,067l.; moreover, the value of work performed for the public service, for which the department received no remuneration, was 21,594l.

The number of messages despatched during 1888 was 1,436,931. The telephone is also much used about the metropolis and some of the principal towns; there are now 535 subscribers who use it, and aerial cables containing multiple wires are now being used to reduce the inconvenience of a large number of separate wires in the street.

Communication with London is maintained, via Brindisi and Torres Straits, every four weeks, with supplementary steamers occasionally; via Brindisi and Melbourne every fortnight; via San Francisco and Sydney every four weeks; and via the Cape every month. The average length of passage by Brindisi and Torres Straits is forty-nine days. Tenders are now being called for a new and faster service by this route. There is daily communication with Sydney and Melbourne, and Adelaide by rail, and frequent communication with all the other parts of Australasia and with Singapore. The rates of postage are:

| Australasia        | 2½d.      |
| United Kingdom via | "         |
| Torres Straits     | 4½d.      |
| Europe, United States | 6½d. |

Education.

A Government system of elementary education was established by Act 39 Vic. No. 1. The central administration is vested in the Secretary for Public Instruction, through the medium of travelling inspectors. Local school boards assist the department with advice and supervision. There are 552 schools, containing 67,918 children on the roll. The schools are free and unsectarian. There are also 126 private schools, with 9,036 children on the roll on Dec., 1888. There are no local rates for education, which is paid for by the whole Colony.

Defence.

The land defence force of the Colony, including the staff, consists of 115 officers and 2,183 non-commissioned officers and men; the volunteer force of 26 officers and 692 non-commissioned officers and men. There is also a force of cadets numbering 8 officers and 220 non-commissioned officers and privates; also unattached officers and medical staff numbering 65.

Marine defence is provided for by 2 gunboats, a torpedo boat, a picket boat, and by six naval brigades and one artillery corps.

Batteries have been erected at Lytton, guarding the entrance of the Brisbane River, and one also at Townsville.

Immigration

The European immigration for the year 1888 was 9,912. The arrivals from Hong Kong numbered 45, and of Polynesians from the South Sea Islands, 2,295.

The land order system of immigration has to a certain extent been revived, inasmuch as persons who now pay their full passage to the colony, and are approved by the Agent-General as suitable colonists, are each granted a land order of the nominal value of twenty pounds. These land orders are issued under the provisions of the Crown Lands Act of 1886, and are available for ten years from date of issue for the payment of the first or any subsequent year's rent of any agricultural or grazing farm taken up under Part IV of the Act. A very extensive system of immigration direct from England was established by means of the British India Steam Navigation Company's vessels in the latter part of the year 1881. These ships coming through the Suez Canal and via Torres Straits, enable the Government to distribute the immigrants carried by them at various ports on the eastern seaboard, where they are likely to obtain employment or wish to settle themselves.

By Act 47 Vic., No. 18 of 1884, a poll tax of 80l. is levied upon every Chinese arriving in the Colony.

Government.

The constitution is regulated by the Letters Patent of 5th June, 1859, and Act 31 Vic., No. 38. The Legislature is formed of two Houses of Parliament, the Legislative Council or the Upper House, and the Lower House or Legislative Assembly. The members of the Council are nominated by the Governor, and hold their offices for life. The members of the Legislative Assembly are elected. There is no property qualification required for membership in either branch of the Legislature. The voting for members of the Assembly is by ballot. Every man of 21 years, who has resided six months in one locality, having a vote. Persons having property, either leasehold or freehold, or a licence to depasture lands from the Government in any electoral district in which they do not reside, have the right of a vote in the district where such property may be situated, as well as in the district for which they claim as residents.

In the Upper Chamber of the Legislature there are at present 39 members, including the President of the Council. By the Electoral Districts Act No. 10 of 1887, the Colony is divided into 60 districts, of which 12 return two members, and 48 return one member each, or a total of 72 members.

ST. HELENA.

Situation and Area.
St. Helena is an island in the South Atlantic Ocean, 800 miles S.E. of Ascension, and 1,200 miles from the coast of South Africa, in 15° 55' S. lat., and 5° 42' W. long. It is 104 miles long and 64 broad; its area is 47 square miles, or about 30,000 acres. The distance from Plymouth is 4,256 miles, and from Capetown 1,695 miles. The usual mail passage is, from Plymouth, 14 days, and from Cape-town, 5 days.

The capital and only town is Jamestown, on the N.W. of the island, with a population of about 4,000. The climate is mild, and varies little, the thermometer ranging in summer between 68° and 72°, and in winter between 57° and 70°. The annual rainfall is about 80 inches. The island is very healthy, the average death-rate for the last three years having been only 16½ per 1,000, including invalids brought to the island seriously ill.

History.
St. Helena, then uninhabited and densely wooded, was discovered by the Portuguese Commander Juan de Nova Castella, on St. Helena's day, May 21st, 1502. The Portuguese contrived to keep secret the situation of the island from other European nations until 1588, when it was sighted by Captain Cavendish, on his return from a voyage round the world. St. Helena was uninhabited till the Dutch became possessors of it. Captain Munden, of the English Navy, in 1673, took it from the Dutch, and soon afterwards the East India Company obtained a charter for its possession from Charles II., and it remained under that Company, with the exception of the period of Napoleon's imprisonment there, till 22nd April, 1834, when it was finally handed over to the British Government, under an Act of Parliament of 1838.
Education and Local Government.

The Government maintain 4 schools, having 330 scholars. There are also 7 private day schools, not aided by Government, having 497 scholars. School attendance is compulsory under Ordinance No. 4 of 1874, and fees of 1d. a week are charged.

The only local authority is the Poor Relief Board, the revenue and expenditure of which for 1888 were £1,303l. and £1,814l.

Industry.

Helena is well watered by clear springs, which are abundant. It is situated in the heart of the South Atlantic trade wind, blowing from the S.E. for 330 days in the year, and in the direct track of vessels homeward bound from the East round the Cape of Good Hope. Previous to the opening of the overland route it was a port of call for a vast quantity of shipping and passengers to and from India and other parts of the East, and in consequence of its importance in connection with the Eastern trade, large establishments were maintained, both civil and military. For many years it was also a depot for liberated Africans landed from slavers captured by the West Coast squadron.

Beyond the supply of the passing shipping it has never produced any article of export properly so called, and the entire trade therefore depends exclusively upon the intercourse and the visits of the Antarctic whalers and of ships in distress. Its trade has greatly diminished in recent years in consequence of the opening of the Suez Canal.

The number of ships calling at Jamestown (now a free port) for supplies show a slight increase. In 1878, including steamers and ships of war, it was 669; in 1879, 602; in 1880, 564; in 1881, 525; in 1882, 497; in 1883, 521; and in 1884, 414; in 1885, 450; in 1886, 376; in 1887, 318; and in 1888, 496. It is a port of registry, but has now no ships.

The chief industries are fishing and agriculture, the main arable crops being barley, oats, Indian corn, and potatoes. Some New Zealand flax is also grown.

There are no private banks in the Colony, but a Government savings bank was established in 1865 (total deposits on 31st December, 1888, 7,550l.), and the Government issues bills of exchange on England.

Means of Communication.

Steamers arrive from England alternately every 3 and 5 weeks, and proceed to the Cape and Natal; steamers arrive from thence every third and fifth week, and proceed to England. Rate of postage: to England and the Cape Colony, 6d. per ½ oz. There is no internal post, but there are 10½ miles of telegraph, constructed by the Colonial Government and the War Office at a cost of 700l. The receipts in 1888 were 58l., and the expenses 225l. 2,263 messages were sent in 1888. The nearest points in telegraphic communication with Europe are Madeira, Capetown, and Loanda. The number of letters passing through the post in 1888 was 21,821, of books and newspapers 3,674, and of parcels 805. The postal revenue was 803l., and the expenditure 1,582l.

Defence.

Jamestown has been made a second-class imperial coaling station, and extensive defensive works have been constructed on the heights overlooking the harbour. The imperial garrison has been reduced to 83 men, and the cadre of an island militia still exists, which it is proposed to revivify.

Sierra Leone.

Situation and Area.

Sierra Leone proper consists of a peninsula terminating in Cape Sierra Leone, and bounded on the north by a river of the same name. The Cape lies in 8° 30' N. lat., 18° 18' W. long. The peninsula is 26 miles in length by 12 in breadth, with an area of 300 square miles. The Colony now includes the whole of the coast southward to the Mannah River, which forms the Liberian boundary, and northward to the Skaricies district, as well as the island of Sherbro, the Isles de Los, and the Banana, Turtle, Leopard, Plantain, Yellabol, Cor-teemo, Tasso, Macanlay, and other islets.

The extreme length of the Colony is over 180 miles, and its area about 4,000 square miles.

History.

The oldest peninsula of Sierra Leone, was ceded to Great Britain in 1787 by the native chiefs. Four years afterwards a charter was granted to a Company under the name of "The Sierra Leone Company," for the purpose of establishing a settlement for freed negro slaves. In 1800 a grant of the peninsula was made to the Company by Letters Patent, and a Court of Directors of the Company was empowered to appoint a Governor and Council, the former having power to enact laws. In 1807, on the abolition of the slave trade, the Colony was transferred back to the Crown. In 1821, on the abolition of the African Company (see under Gold Coast), the whole of the British possessions in West Africa were united into the Colony of the West Africa Settlements. The Gold Coast was, however, soon abandoned to the merchants, and the Gambia was made a separate Colony in 1843.

In 1862 two large tracts of country called British Kwai and Sherbro were handed over by treaty to the Colony. In 1879 further territory was acquired in the Skaricies River to the north of the peninsula. In 1884 the seaboard of the Sulymah and Gallinas Chiefs as far as the Mannah River was also annexed.

Constitution.

By a Charter issued on May 27, 1863, an Executive Council was created, composed of four members nominated by the Crown. The Legislative Council was to consist of the members of the Executive Council and nominated members.

In 1865, it was decided that a Central Government of the settlements on the West Coast of Africa should be established, with the seat of government at Sierra Leone. This change was effected by a Charter, dated the 19th of February, 1866.

By a new Charter, dated the 24th of July, 1874, so much of the Charter of the 19th of February, 1866, was revoked as provided for the government of the Gold Coast and Lagos under the Governor-in-Chief of the West Africa Settlements; and those settlements were erected into a distinct government. A further Charter was then issued, dated 17th of December, 1874, which erected a new government of the "West Africa Settlements," consisting of Sierra Leone and the Gambia, and created a legislative council in each settlement, consisting of the officer administering the government, and not less than two other persons, to be designated by royal instructions.
or warrant. New letters patent were issued, dated 17th June, 1885, providing for the continuance of the government on the same lines, with some minor differences. By letters patent of 28th Nov., 1888, the Gambia was again made a separate government. Under these, the Governor is aided by an executive council composed of five officials besides the officer administering the government. The legislative council, of which the Governor is ex officio president, is composed of the members of the executive council, as official members, and three unofficial members nominated by the Crown.

General Description.

The capital, Freetown, lies about 4 miles up the Sierra Leone River at the foot of a chain of hills rising 1,700 feet. It contains 25,000 inhabitants, and possesses the best harbour in West Africa. It is an important coaling station and commercial entrepôt. It has been selected as a second class Imperial coaling station. It is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1888, 27 vessels registered, of 865 tons. The next largest towns are Waterloo in the 2nd Eastern District, and Bonthe on Sherbro Island.

The Colony contains many different races of inhabitants including a large number of Mahommedan negroes. Treaties of friendship have long existed with the native chiefs beyond British territory as far inland as Foutah, and annual stipends are paid to many of them in return for their protection of commerce and the internal roads.

The scenery is extremely beautiful. The undulating hills which stretch throughout the length of the peninsula are clad all the year round in an evergreen mantle of gigantic trees with rich foliage. The soil is good for agricultural purposes, and there is an abundant supply of pure fresh water. Tropical fruits grow luxuriantly, and cattle and poultry are plentiful.

Industry.

Most of the inhabitants are engaged in trade in the products of the interior, the principal exports being palm oil and kernels, beni seed, ground nuts, cola nuts, indiarubber, copal, hides, and ginger. Agriculture is much neglected, and there are no manufactures except the weaving of native cloths, boat-building, and mat-making. The natives of Sierra Leone are to be found engaged as traders on the Niger and in all the commercial centres of the West Coast. The imports are chiefly spirits, tobacco, cotton goods, furniture, and hardware. Three-quarters of the imports come from the United Kingdom, which only takes a third of the exports, the rest going to the other African settlements, France, Germany, and the United States.

Currency and Banking.

Besides British currency, gold doubloons, eagles, and the coins of the Latin union, are current and legal tender. There is no Colonial coinage, and no note circulation. No private banks exist; but a Government Savings Bank was established in 1882, and had in 1888 11,929l. deposited, belonging to 697 depositors.

Education.

A system of Government grants and inspection was established in 1882. There are 89 elementary schools in the Colony, with 10,000 scholars; they are all denominational, and charge fees. Education is not compulsory. The Church Missionary Society has a successful secondary school in Freetown, and a training college at Fourah Bay affiliated to Durham University. The Wesleyan Missionary Society possesses a progressive high school for boys. There are also in Freetown three high schools devoted to the task of female education.

There is also a wharfage duty of 10s. per ton on all imports landed at the Government wharf or jetty at Freetown.

Means of Communication.

Steamers leave Liverpool for Madeira and Freetown every Saturday, and the average length of passage is 7 days to Madeira, and 8 or 9 days from Madeira to Freetown. There is also regular steam communication with Hamburg, Havre, and Marseilles, as well as with Lisbon and Algiers.

Telegraphic communication with Europe was established in 1886, there being now three cables, direct to Bathurst, Conakry, and Accra respectively.

There are no railways or internal telegraphs. Horses do not thrive, and there is but little wheel traffic and few roads fit for it. Internal communication is mainly kept up by the network of rivers and lagoons.

The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters, Newspapers. | per ½ oz. |

Climate.

The climate of Sierra Leone is unhealthy, especially for Europeans. The seasons are divided into wet and dry; the former commencing in May, and lasting till October. The beginning and ending of the wet season are the most sickly periods of the year. The average mean temperature is about 85°, the extreme range being from 64°5° to 100°6° in the shade.

The rain-fall during the past four years has averaged over 164 inches in Freetown.
