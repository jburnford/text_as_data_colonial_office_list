GRENADA.

Situation and Area.

Grenada is situated between the parallels of 12° 30' and 11° 58' N. lat., and 61° 29' and 61° 35' W. long.; is about 21 miles in length, 12 miles in its greatest breadth, and contains about 183 square miles. It lies 68 miles S.S.W. of St. Vincent, and between it and the latter island are certain small islands called the Grenadines, partly attached to the government of St. Vincent, and partly to that of Grenada; the largest of the latter is Carriacou, which has an area of 6,913 acres, and a population of 5,154 souls.

General Description.

The country is mountainous and very picturesque, and abounds in streams and in mineral and other springs. The Grand Etang, a lake on the summit of a mountain ridge 1,740 feet above the level of the sea, 7 miles from St. George, and Lake Antoine are among the most remarkable natural curiosities. The island is divided into six parishes—St. George, St. David, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, St. Mark, and St. John. St. George's, the principal town, is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1888, 56 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 911 tons. The town has a population of 4,000.

The other towns in the island are Charlotte Town (or Gouyave), St. Patrick (or Sainteure), and Grenville (or La Baye). Most of the inhabitants speak a French patois. About two per cent. are of European blood, the remainder being of the negro race, except 1,960 imported coolies.

Industry.

The island has long ceased to be a great sugar producing colony, and its main product is cocoa, but a good deal of rum (43,800 gallons in 1888) is still manufactured. Spices, cocoanuts, and fruit are also grown, and live stock, poultry, vegetables, and firewood are shipped to Trinidad and Barbados. The main imports are food stuffs, textiles, timber, and hardware.

There is a Government savings bank in St. George with 277 depositors and 5,632l. deposited. Branch banks were opened in the out districts on 1st April, 1889.

History.

Grenada was discovered by Columbus in 1498, and was named Ascension. It was at that time inhabited by Caribs. In 1650 Du Parquet, Governor of Martinique, purchased Grenada from a French company. Finding the expense of maintaining an armed force to support his authority not compensated by the expectation of future profits, Du Parquet sold the island in 1657 to the Comte de Cerrillac for 30,000 crowns. The governor appointed by the new proprietor ruled with so much tyranny that the most respectable settlers left the island; he was at length seized, tried, and executed by the colonists.

In 1674 the island was annexed to France, and the proprietors received compensation for their claims; but in 1762 it was surrendered to the English Commodore Swanton, and was formally ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Peace signed at Paris on the 10th of February, 1763. In 1779 it was retaken by the French; and in 1783 it was restored to Great Britain by the general Treaty of Peace of Versailles. In 1787 St. George's was made a free port.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and this was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation.

Constitution.

There was formerly a Legislative Council as well as a House of Assembly, the latter consisting of 26 elected members, and regulated by an Act of 1854.

Under an Act dated 14th October, 1856, and limited in its duration to a term of three years, an Executive Council was formed, in lieu of the Legislative Council. The Act was allowed to expire, and the Legislative Council resumed its executive functions under the style of Her Majesty's Council.

The constitution was re-modelled by an Act of the 7th of October, 1875, and a single Legislative Assembly established in lieu of the Council and Assembly. The Assembly consisted of 17 Members, 8 elected by the people, and 9 nominated by the Crown. The Act also appointed an Executive Committee of 5 Members, 3 being nominated and the other 2 elected Members of Assembly. These Members received each a salary of 100l. a-year, and were charged with the duty of advising the Lieutenant-Governor on the conduct of affairs.

This Assembly at its first meeting on the 9th of February, 1876, addressed the Queen, informing Her Majesty that it had passed a bill providing for its own extinction, and leaving "it entirely to your Majesty's wisdom and discretion to erect such form of Government as your Majesty may deem most desirable for the welfare of the Colony." The Imperial Act (39 and 40 Vict., c. 47) empowered Her Majesty to comply with this address, and a new Legislative Council has been established by the Queen, consisting of six official members besides the Governor, and seven unofficial members nominated by the Crown. The unofficial members hold their seats for six years from the date of their appointment.

On the 17th March, 1885, letters patent were passed constituting anew the office of Governor of the Windward Islands, under which Grenada was made the head-quarters of the group.

Education.

There are 8 Government elementary schools, and 21 aided schools. The latter are under the local management of the ministers of the different religious sects. Building grants and annual grants in aid are made by the Government on the result of inspections. The central administration is entrusted to a Board of Education nominated by the Governor, half the members being Roman Catholic. In 1888 the average attendance was 2,287 children, the number on the rolls being 4,440. Fees are charged in all schools. There is a grammar school partly supported from public funds, and a school for the secondary education of girls.*
