NEWFOUNDLAND.

(See Map, page 52.)

Situation and Area.

Newfoundland is an island situated between 46° 27' and 51° 39' N. lat., and 52° 35' and 59° 23' W. long., on the north-east side of the Gulf of St. Lawrence; the greatest length from north to south is 350 miles, and average breadth about 130; its estimated area is 40,200 square miles.

Labrador.

The coast of Labrador, from Cape Chidley (Hudson's Strait) to Anse Sablon (Strait of Belle Isle), including the basin of the Hamilton, is under Letters Patent of 28th March, 1876, included in the colony, the remainder of the Labrador peninsula forming part of Quebec and the North-West Territories of the Canadian Dominion. The area is about 120,000 square miles, with a coast line of some 600 miles, but the country is of the bleakest, and possesses only about 5,000 permanent inhabitants (some 1,700 Eskimo, the remainder of British descent), occupied in the fisheries and in trapping. The population is greatly increased in summer by fishermen and sportsmen, over 1,000 vessels being employed. Battle Harbour (Strait of Belle Isle) is the chief port, the other villages being the Moravian Mission stations (commenced 1770) at Hopetak, Nain, Okkak, and Hebron. The customs duties are those of Newfoundland.

Labrador, discovered by the Norsemen and (in 1497) by Cabot, was early frequented by Basque and subsequent by Breton fishermen, and became British on the conquest of Canada (1759). In 1763 the Atlantic coast was annexed to Newfoundland, but was temporarily re-annexed to Quebec from 1773 to 1809. The first judicial court was established in 1824; it was revived in 1863, but has been discontinued for some years past. The collector of customs, who visits Labrador every summer in a revenue cruiser, is a J.P.; no other administration exists.

History.

The island was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was as early as 1500 frequented by the Portuguese, Spanish, and French, for its fisheries. Sir Walter Raleigh and others, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, attempted to colonize this island, but were not successful. In 1623, Sir G. Calvert, afterwards Lord Baltimore, established himself in the south-east part of the island, and appointed his son Governor. In 1634, a party of colonists were sent over from Ireland, and 20 years after, some English colonists arrived, having emigrated by means of a Parliamentary grant.

The French, about 1620, established a station at Placentia; and for many years the French and English settlers were constantly annoying each other. At the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, subsequently ratified by the Treaty of Paris, the exclu-
sive sovereignty of Newfoundland was acknowledged to belong to Great Britain, certain rights being granted to French fishermen, which are still in question between the two nations. The French possess the small islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, and the district is resorted to annually by a French fishing fleet from St. Malo. They claim the exclusive right to fish along certain portions of the coast from Cape John to Cape Ray, upon which they are allowed temporary structures for drying the fish. The exact extent of this right is in dispute, and there are other questions at issue as to magisterial jurisdiction, mines, harbours, and river fisheries. A proposal for the settlement of all the questions was agreed to in 1885 by commissioners representing France and England, but was rejected by Newfoundland.

Industries.

The industries of the island—fishing, agricultural, and mining—are mainly confined to the sea coast. Copper is largely worked for export, and lead and silver are also found.

The cod-fishery is the staple industry, and after this in importance rank the fisheries for seal, salmon, herring, and lobster. Haddock and mackerel are now only taken occasionally. The cod appears off the coast early in June, and the fishery extends north for over 700 miles, including the coast of Labrador, the grounds varying in depth from 50 to 360 feet. In 1884 the number of men engaged was 60,419, including the subsidiary industries, with 1,618 vessels, of about 74,628 tons, besides 18,000 boats employed in the shore fisheries. The home consumption is about 270,000 quintals, and the export in 1888 was 953,537 quintals, 30 bank cod going, on an average, to one quintal. The export is mainly to Portugal, Spain, Brazil, and the United Kingdom. The chief imports are flour, textiles, salt pork, mashes, butter, and salt. These are derived mainly from Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Currency and Banking.

There are two banks in the Colony, the Union Bank of Newfoundland (capital £114,000, note circulation £548,142), and the Commercial Bank of Newfoundland (capital £76,500, note circulation £393,376); their aggregate deposits in 1887 amounted to £908,666. There is a Government savings bank at St. John's, Harbour Grace, and Heart's Content, with £1,860,969 deposits, and 4,516 depositors.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, United States gold and full weight dollars, gold doubloons, Mexican and other dollars, and Colonial coins. Much of the trade is carried on by barter. Accounts are kept in dollars and cents.

Means of Communication.

There is a railway from St. John's to Harbour Grace, 84 miles in length, constructed and worked by a private company. The total approximate cost of construction was £2,500,000, the receipts in 1886 being £46,772l., and the expenses £46,974l. A branch line has been constructed by the Government, connecting with Placentia. About 750 miles of postal and 1,700 miles of district roads are maintained. There are 994½ miles of telegraph open, and cables start for Europe (at Heart's Content) and America (at Placentia). There is a fortnightly mail service (except from January to March) with Liverpool, Halifax, New York, Montreal, and Prince Edward Island. A small steamer takes the mails along the Labrador coast fortnightly during the summer. The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters, per ½ oz. | Newspapers |
|-------------------|------------|
| In St. John's      | 1 cent     | Free       |
| Within Colony      | 8 "        | "          |
| Europe, United States, and St. Pierre, Miquelon | 5 " | 1 cent |
| South America and West Indies | 8 " | 2 " |

Climate.

The climate is milder than that of Canada; the mean temperature at St. John's is 34°, the extreme range being from 13° below zero to 86°. There is an almost total absence of spring, the summer setting in very suddenly in May. The average annual rainfall is 51 inches, evenly distributed throughout the year. Two-thirds of the inhabitants are descended from the British settlers, English being generally spoken; but about one-third belong to the Roman Catholic religion, and a small number of these are of French extraction. The last of the aboriginal inhabitants died out about 1829; they were of the Bethuk tribe.

Defence.

There is no Imperial garrison.

Education.

The Government system of primary education rests upon the Act of 1887. The central administration is vested in three superintendents, belonging respectively to the Roman Catholic, the Anglican, and the Methodist denominations. The local management is in the hands of appointed boards. There are 517 schools, with 30,744 scholars. The schools are denominational (except Harbour Grace Grammar School), and fees are charged. Grants are also made in aid of secondary schools, but there is no provision for technical education. The total cost of primary education in 1888 was £118,624.

Chief Towns.

The capital is St. John's, with 28,610 inhabitants. The next port in importance is Harbour Grace, with a population of 7,054; Fogo, with Twillingate, has 4,777; Bona Vista 3,463; and Carbonear 3,796 inhabitants.

Constitution.

Newfoundland has had a legislature since 1832, but it was the last of the North American Colonies to which responsible Government was conceded; it was established in 1855. The Government is at present administered by a Governor, aided by a responsible Executive Council not to exceed 7 members, in which the Governor presides, a Legislative Council not to exceed 15 members, and a House of Assembly of 36 members, elected by householders who have occupied a dwelling-house as owner or tenant for 1 year immediately preceding the day of election. There are 30,000 (exclusive of Burgeo and La Poile) electors registered on the electoral roll, and 19 districts, or subdivisions of districts, of which 7 return three members, 3 return two members, and 9 return one. There is a property qualification for members, viz., property exceeding 500l. in amount or value, or a net annual income of 100l. The ordinary duration of the Session is about three months, and the Legislature generally meets towards the end of January.
Members of the Council and Assembly receive $120 each (President $240), per session, which is provided for annually in a local Act. There are no municipal institutions in the Colony.

NEW SOUTH WALES.*

Situation and Area.

This Colony is situated on the eastern coast of the Australian continent, from Point Danger, and the 29th parallel, to Cape Howe, the boundary of Victoria. It is bounded on the west by the 141st meridian of east longitude; on the south mainly by the River Murray, and on the north by the 29th parallel.

* Norfolk Island, formerly a receptacle for English convicts, and Pitcairn Island, famous on account of the story of the mutiny of the "Bounty," are under the superintendence of the Secretary of New South Wales. An account of these islands will be found at page 195. Lord Howe Island, situated about 300 miles east of Sydney, in lat. 31° 30' S., and long 159° 25' E., forms part of the Colony, and is administered by a visiting magistrate. It is 7 miles by 1 mile, with hills 3,000 feet high, of volcanic origin, and densely wooded. The islet of Ball's Pyramid lies between Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands.

Sydney, the seat of Government, is in 33° 51' S. lat., and 151° 12' E. long.

The Colony contains 306,066 square miles (195,882,150 acres), of which 42,383,119 acres have been alienated.

History.

This part of the Australian coast is said to have been discovered by Portuguese and Dutch navigators in the 17th century, but no settlement was made. Captain Cook explored it in 1770, but the first settlement was not formed until 1788, when the convict station (intended for Botany Bay) was established at Port Jackson under Captain Phillips, R.N.

The Settlement of New South Wales was then held to include the whole western shore of the continent. The first newspaper was established in 1808. The population in 1810 was 9,000. The Merino sheep was introduced in this year. The passage through the Blue Mountains, giving access to the interior plains, was not discovered until 1813. Moreton Bay was settled in 1824. In 1828 the total population was only 37,000. Convicts ceased to arrive in 1841. The discovery of gold in 1851 led to a very rapid growth of what is now Victoria, settled in 1836, which was made a separate Colony in 1851. Responsible government was established in 1855. Moreton Bay, to the north, was constituted a separate Colony in 1859, under the name of Queensland.

Climate.

The climate of New South Wales affords a wide range of temperature; from Kiandra, where the mean is 43° 5', to Grafton, 69° 0'. On the coast it varies from 59° 7' at Eden, to 69° 0' at Grafton. Sydney being 61° 7', almost the same as Madrid (61° 4'). On the mountains snow lies in some places all the winter. On the high table land at Bathurst the mean temperature is 56° 8', and on the inland plains about 70° 0'.

The rainfall decreases as the distance from the coast increases; at Deniliquin it is 13 inches; at Sydney, 49 inches; and the days on which rain falls, 141. At London the number of days is 146, and the amount 24 inches; only 25 per cent of this falls in quantities of half an inch and upwards in a day, while in Sydney 60 per cent may be said to fall in torrents of from half an inch to 8 inches per day.

The prevalent winds in summer are the northeast sea-breeze and light westerly; in winter, dry, cold westerly, and wet S. and S.E.

In winter, on the lowlands, frosts are common in the southern and rare in the northern districts.

Trade and Industry.

The great staple produce of New South Wales is wool.

The export of wool the produce of the Colony during the past ten years has been as follows:—

| Year | Quantity (lbs.) | Value (£) |
|------|----------------|----------|
| 1879 | 128,710,450    | 6,491,198 |
| 1880 | 154,871,832    | 8,040,625 |

| 1882 | 146,221,182    | 7,433,091 |
| 1883 | 188,161,710    | 9,598,761 |
| 1884 | 173,986,308    | 8,953,100 |

| 1888 | 285,848,944    | 9,089,776 |

In addition to which, wool to the value of 268,789£,
the produce of other colonies, was exported during 1888.

The live stock on 31 December, 1888, was as follows—horses, 411,368; cattle, 1,622,907; sheep, 46,508,469; pigs, 248,583. Gold and coin, produce of the Colony, exported in 1888, was valued at £80,776l.; in 1881, £915,028l.; 1882, £1,679,731l.; 1883, £1,689,517l.; 1884, £934,406l.; 1885, £1,451,124l.; 1886, £1,619,938l.; 1887, £1,298,569l.; 1888, £1,792,489l.

Coal to the value of £1,089,403l. was exported during 1888, and the other chief exports were, silver (£1,075,737l.), maize (£58,978l.), wine (£32,565l.), tin (£907,688l.), copper (£407,607l.).

Rich silver mines are worked at Broken Hill, in the Barrier district, nine miles from the South Australian border.

In addition to these products, tobacco, sugar, many kinds of fruit, kerosene, and other commodities are produced largely for home consumption.

The chief imports are textiles, alcohol, hardware, and books.

42·53 per cent. of the import trade is with Great Britain, and 37·67 per cent. of the export. Altogether Britain and British possessions absorb 91·47 per cent. of the import, and nearly 89 per cent. of the export trade.

The coal mines have steadily advanced since 1863. The produce of 18 mines in that year is given as 433,889 tons, valued at £236,230l., while in 1881, 1,775,224 tons, valued at £603,248l., were raised from 40 mines; and in 1888, 3,203,444 tons, valued at £1,455,198l., raised from 71 mines.

Sydney and Newcastle are ports of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1888, 60 vessels, of a total tonnage of 7,458.

Currency and Banking.

The currency is exclusively British sterling. At Sydney there is a branch of the Royal Mint at which gold was received for carriage during 1888 to the extent of £2,182,231l.

The following banks have branches in the Colony:

Bank of New South Wales, Commercial Bank, Bank of Australasia, Union Bank of Australia, Australian Joint Stock Bank, London Chartered Bank of Australia, English, Scottish and Australian Chartered Bank, City Bank, Federal Bank of Australia, Queensland National Bank, Bank of New Zealand, Commercial Bank of Australia, Mercantile Bank, National Bank of Australasia, New Oriental Bank.

Deposits bearing interest ... £21,360,684
" not " " " " " 10,556,627
Total ... ... ... £31,917,311

The total note circulation at the same date was £664,348l.

The New South Wales Savings Bank, established 1832, had, at close of 1888, 57,032 depositors, with £2,299,971l. deposited. Interest is allowed at the rate of 5½ per cent. per annum on deposits up to £100l. The Government (Post Office) Savings Banks, established in 1871, had, on 31st December, 1888, £1,737,704l. deposited by 71,265 depositors. Interest is allowed at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum on deposits from £1. up to £200l.

Means of Communication.

There are more than 24,000 miles of common roads, 5,000 of which are metalled. In addition to 50 miles of bridges, there are 87 public ferries, 4 being worked by steam. There are 2,125 miles of railways, all owned and worked by the Government, the total cost of construction having been £26,630,664l. The receipts during 1888 were £2,509,527l., and the working expenses £1,578,590l., the balance therefore available towards meeting the annual charge for interest being £930,937l. There are also 80¾ miles of private railway which cost £315,472l. to construct. There are also 45¾ miles of Government tramways, earning in 1888 £241,839l., against working expenses amounting to £217,629l. The total capital expenditure on tramways, £1,014,664l. Of telegraphs there are 10,690 miles open with 22,219 miles of wire with 460 stations. The cost of construction was £704,912l., and the receipts during 1888, £45,962l. Nearly all the coast rivers are navigable, especially the Richmond, the Clarence, and the Hunter, while Port Jackson and Port Stephens are unrivalled natural harbours. Steamers leave Sydney regularly for nearly all parts of the world, but the direct communication with Europe is chiefly by the fortnightly vessels of the P. and O. and Orient lines, and by those of the Messageries Maritimes (via Marseilles) Union Company (via San Francisco) and North German Lloyd (via Genoa). Seven mails per month are sent to and received from England.

The rates of postage are:

Education.

The education system of New South Wales is under the control of the Minister of Public Instruction, regulated by the Education Act of 1880. Teachers are recognised as Civil Servants, and are paid by fixed salaries. The school fee is 3½d. per week per child, and the fees collected are paid into the Treasury as revenue. Education is compulsory up to the age of 14. In 1888 there were 2,271 State schools in operation, namely, 5 high schools, 2 for boys and 3 girls, 1,635 public schools, 317 provisional schools, 223 half-time schools, 79 house-to-house schools under itinerant teachers, and 13 evening public schools. The Colony has been divided into public school districts, with one Local Board appointed for each district. School buildings are erected wholly at the expense of the Government. Denominational schools have ceased to be supported by the State, but general religious instruction may be imparted by the State teachers, and clergymen of the various denominations are entitled to appropriate one hour a day for religious instruction in the tenets of their respective churches. For the year 1888 the net cost to the State of public instruction was about £527,549l. In 1888, 186,692 children attended the ordinary State schools, and nearly 1,200 were inmates of the orphan schools, industrial schools, and the school for the deaf and dumb and the...
blind. In 1888, private schools, including church schools, showed an attendance of 40,164 children.

The University of Sydney was established and endowed by the State in 1861. Its State endowment was originally 5,000l., but is now 12,000l. per annum—5,000l. additional having been voted in 1882, and 2,000l. more in 1883. The endowment is largely added to by annual special grants and by private donations. The Parliamentary grant for 1888 amounted to nearly 19,099l., and 22,929l. was expended by Government on buildings. Three denominational colleges are affiliated to the University, each having a State endowment of 500l. per annum. The University has the power of granting degrees in arts, law, medicine, and science. Recently several faculties have been added to its curriculum. The number of students in 1888 was 647. In the metropolis there is a public grammar school, attended by 428 pupils, and having a State endowment of 1,500l., and a total vote for 1888—for endowment, buildings, and salaries—of 8,233l. There is also a technical college for working men, and in the country towns there are about 150 mechanics' schools of arts.

Parliament voted for 1888 47,695l. towards the support of schools of arts, for technical instruction—in the college and in connection with the schools of arts and the evening public schools—a Board of Technical Education, consisting of 24 members, has been constituted for the purpose of establishing a State system of technical education in the Colony. There are also a Royal Society, a Medical, a Linnean, a Zoological, and an Art Society, with many other educational associations of a like character. For the Sydney Free Library a grant of 6,949l. was made in 1888; for the Museum and the Technical Museum, 8,670l.; and for the Fine Art Gallery, 5,000l.

The total State grant available for 1888 for educational purposes—as enumerated in the foregoing statement—was about 678,267l.

Defence.

Batteries with heavy guns have been erected at South, Middle, George and Bradley's Heads, also at Newcastle and Botany, and along the coast.

The Military Forces consist of:—(a) Regular Forces.—Artillery, 500; Submarine Miners, 24; Mounted Infantry, 32. (b) partially paid Volunteers.—Artillery, 614; Engineers, 97; Submarine Miners, 111; Mounted Infantry, 300; and Infantry, 2,940. (c) Volunteer Reserves—Cavalry, 400; Artillery, 110; Infantry, 500; and Rifle Volunteer Companies, 2,000.

The Naval Forces are a Naval Brigade, numbering 328, partially paid, and 200 Naval Artillery Volunteers, purely voluntary. Including the general Staff, Volunteer, Permanent and Medical Staff, there is a total force of 8,140 of all ranks.

Local Government.

This is regulated mainly by Act No. 12 of 1887. Under this Act there have been established 137 municipal boroughs and municipal districts, controlling property of the annual value of 6,675,697l., and having a revenue in 1888 of 689,724l., exclusive of loans, an expenditure of 894,077l., and an outstanding debt of 1,552,087l.

Constitution.

The first legislative council dates from 1824; it was greatly enlarged and made chiefly elective in 1842. "Responsible government" was established by the Constitution Act, 18 and 19 Vict., cap. 54. The Governor is appointed by the Crown; so also is the Legislative Council, which consists of not fewer than 21 persons, of whom not less than four-fifths must be persons not holding office under the Crown, except officers in H.M.'s sea or land forces on full or half pay. The members of the first Legislative Council of the Colony were appointed for 5 years, but all subsequent appointments have been made for life, subject to certain provisions contained in the Act. The Council now consists of 60 members.

The Legislative Assembly, under the "Electoral Act of 1880" (44 Vict., No. 13), consists of 124 members, representing 72 electoral districts; and provision is made for giving increased representation to the several constituencies according to growth of population. The qualification for election to the Assembly extends to "every male subject of Her Majesty of the full age of 21 years and absolutely free, being a natural-born or naturalized subject," with certain special exceptions. The Assembly lasts for three years, unless previously dissolved under a law passed in 1889. Members receive 300l. per annum.

The electoral franchise is given, subject to certain official and other disqualifications, to "every male subject of Her Majesty of the full age of 21 years and absolutely free, being a natural-born or naturalized subject," if entered on the Roll of Electors, under one or other of the following heads:—

1. "Resident Electors.—Six months in District.
2. "Non-Resident Electors.—Every such subject, whether or not so resident as aforesaid, who shall have at the time of making out the said Electoral List, and for the six months then next preceding shall have had within the district a freehold or leasehold estate in possession of the clear value of 100l., or of the annual value of 10l. respectively, or who shall then occupy, and for the said six months have occupied, within the district any house, of the annual value of 10l., or who shall hold, and for the said 6 months shall have held, a Crown lease or license for pastoral purposes within such district."

The voting at elections is by ballot, as it was also under the old electoral Act of 1858, now repealed.
