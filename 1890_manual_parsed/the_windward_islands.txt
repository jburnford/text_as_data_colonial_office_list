THE WINDWARD ISLANDS.

(See Map, page 22.)

Situation and Area.

The Windward, or southern group of the West Indian Islands, includes the following islands lying in the order named from north to south, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Barbados, the Grenadines and Grenada. Tobago and Trinidad belong geographically more to the continent of South America than to the Antilles. All these islands are British.

Barbados and Trinidad are entirely separate colonies, each under its own Governor, and accounts of them will be found under their respective headings. Tobago has been united in one Government with Trinidad, under 50 and 51 Vict., cap. 44. The remaining three British islands are now grouped for administrative purposes under one Governor-in-Chief, who usually resides at St. George's, Grenada. The total area of the combined Colony is 524 square miles, and its population about 180,000.

History.

Some account is given of the history of each island in its proper place, but particulars of their several federal unions may be conveniently inserted here. As early as 1764 there was one Governor for the "Southern Caribbee Islands" of Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent, and Tobago. In 1833 St. Vincent was included with Barbados, Grenada, and Tobago in one general government, the Governor-in-Chief being resident at Barbados, with Lieutenant-Governors in each of the other islands. In 1838 St. Lucia was included in this general government.

On the 17th March, 1886, Letters Patent were passed constituting the Government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being omitted. Tobago was united to Trinidad 1st Jan., 1889.

Constitution.

Each island retains its own institutions, and is presided over by a resident Administrator, who is also Colonial Secretary. There is no common legislature; nor common laws, revenue, or tariff. There is, however, a common Court of Appeal, constituted in 1859, consisting of the chief justices of the several islands and of Barbados. The colonies have also united for sundry other common purposes, such as the maintenance of a lunatic asylum. A common audit system, under the administration of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, was instituted in 1889.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, doubloons, and the gold coins of the United States. There is no Government note issue, but the "Colonial Bank," which has branches in the larger islands, issues five dollar notes to the extent of 9,800l. in St. Lucia, 12,700l. in Grenada, and 8,000l. in St. Vincent. Public accounts are kept in sterling, but banking and private accounts generally in dollars. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver.

The majority of the inhabitants are of the negro race, less than 5 per cent. being white. A few Caribs still remain in St. Vincent, and there are about 5,000 Indian Coolies. English is usually spoken, except in Gr-nada and St. Lucia, where the prevailing language is a French patois.

Communications.

The "Royal Mail" Company's steamers communicate fortnightly with England, and touch at most of the islands. All three islands are in telegraphic communication with Europe and the other West Indian islands by cables to St. Thomas and St. Croix. There is no railway in any of them.
