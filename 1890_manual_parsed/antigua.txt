ANTIGUA.

Antigua is situated in W. long. 61° 45', and N. lat. 17° 6'. It is about 54 miles in circumference, and its area is 108 square miles.

The islands of Barbuda and Redonda are dependencies of Antigua. They have a total area of 62 square miles. Redonda, lying between Montserrat and Nevis, 25 miles S.W. of Antigua, in 25° 6' N. lat., 61° 35' W. long., 1 mile by ½ mile, 1,000 feet high, is valuable for its phosphate of alumina mines, discovered 1865, now worked by the Redonda Phosphate Company under license at 6d. per ton royalty. On an average 7,000 tons are
annually exported to the United States, 90 men being employed.

Antigua was discovered by Columbus in 1498, who named it after a church in Seville, called Santa Maria La Antigua. It was first inhabited by a few English in 1632. In 1663, Charles II. made a formal grant of the island to Lord Willoughby, who sent out a large number of colonists. After an interval of French occupation, it was declared a British possession by the Treaty of Breda, 1666. There are no rivers, and few springs in the island, and consequently it is exposed to frequent droughts.

The Constitution consists of a Governor, aided by an Executive Council, the members of which are appointed by the Crown; and a Legislative Council consisting of 24 members, of which the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Auditor-General, and Treasurer, are ex officio members; 8 members nominated by the Crown and 12 elected members.

The qualifications for Members and Voters were fixed by an Act of 1845, and are as follows:

For Members.—An annual income of £64. derived from real property within the Island, or an annual income of £200. derived from profession or trade, &c. Voters for the city and towns must possess land either in fee simple, or as a tenant for a period of not less than six months previous to election, and of the yearly value of £25. Voters for the country divisions—possession of ten acres of land in fee simple, or of five acres with building thereon, or land of the value of £11.1., or one acre of land and building value £221., or tenancy paying not less than £8. per annum.

The Island is divided into eleven electoral districts. Of the 344 voters registered for the whole island, 181 are registered for the City of St. John.

The Governor appoints the President and Vice-President of the Legislative Council. All grants or appropriations of money must originate with the Government Members. The duration of the Council is for five years. The elected members of the Legislative Council of Antigua send four elected members to the General Legislature.

The chief productions are sugar and pine-apples, but much of the land has been allowed to become ruined in the hands of the old planting families. There are 102 estates in cultivation, comprising 20,000 acres. St. John, the chief town, has a population of 10,000, and is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1888, 45 vessels registered, with a total tonnage of 1,299, chiefly engaged in coasting trade. The other towns are Falmouth and Parham.

ST. CHRISTOPHER AND NEVIS.

The Presidency consists of the Islands of St. Christopher (St. Kitts), Nevis, and Anguilla, with their several dependencies. These were united to form one Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1882.

The total population is about 45,000, and the total area about 153 square miles.

Constitution.

There is one Executive Council for the United Presidency, consisting of such persons as Her Majesty may from time to time appoint.

The Legislative body is styled the Legislative Council of St. Christopher and Nevis, and consists of ten official and ten nominated unofficial members; the Governor, or, in his absence, a member appointed by him, presides, and the President enjoys an original and also a casting vote. Of the ten unofficial members, seven are chosen from among the inhabitants of St. Christopher and Anguilla, and three from Nevis. The council meets at Basseterre in St. Christopher, and is convened at such times as the Governor sees fit.

Industry.

The main industry of the two larger islands is the production of sugar, molasses, and rum. Arrowroot, coffee, cocoa, and tobacco are also grown in small quantities. Cattle are raised. Salt is produced in St. Kitts and Anguilla. The sugar crop of 1888 amounted to 19,535 hogsheads for St. Kitts and Nevis.

St. Kitts.

The island lies in latitude 17° 18' N., and longitude 62° 48' W. The area of the main body of it presents a long oval, from the south-eastern end of which runs a narrow neck, gradually expanding into a small knob of land.

The total length of the island is about 23 miles. The total area is 68 square miles.

The central part of the main body consists of a range of lofty rugged mountains, which traverses it from south-east to north-west, attaining its greatest height at Mount Misery, which is about 4,100 feet above the sea. On the south-west side of the island, between the mountains and the sea, but nearer the latter, is Brimstone Hill, formerly the seat of the garrison. It is quite isolated, nearly conical, and about 750 feet in height. This range of hills describes nearly a semicircle, forming the spacious and fertile valley or plain, on the seaboard of which lies Basseterre, the capital. Basseterre, population about 7,000, is a port of registry, and had on 31st December, 1888, 45 vessels registered, with a total tonnage of 786.

The circle of land formed by the skirts and lower slopes of the mountain-range of the main body of the island, and the Valley of Basseterre, constitute nearly the whole of the arable and cultivated portion of the island.

The climate, for a tropical one, is decidedly healthy. The temperature is from 78° to 85°.

The rainfall for the year 1887 was 47:59 inches.

The island was at one time divided between France and England, but the French were expelled in the last century.

Until the year 1866, St. Christopher had representative institutions of the type formerly so general in the West Indies. In 1866 (by Act No. 551), the two Houses were replaced by a single Legislative Assembly, partly nominated and partly elected. This Assembly abrogated itself, and substituted for itself a Legislative Council, consisting of five official and five unofficial members (Act of 28th June, 1878). The members were nominated by the Queen. The Governor, however, had power to nominate unofficial members provisionally. The Governor was President, or, in his absence, such member as he appointed in writing. Four besides the President were a quorum.
Nevis.

The island of Nevis is situated in 17° 10' N. lat. and 62° 38' W. long. It was discovered in 1498 by Columbus, and was colonized by the English in 1628. Charlestown, the principal town, lies along the shore of a wide bay, and the mountain begins to rise immediately behind it. It has a population of about 1,500, and is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1888, one vessel registered, with a tonnage of 186.

The island, which is divided into five parishes, is nearly of a circular form; its area is about 50 square miles, or about 32,000 acres, of which about 16,000 acres are fit for cultivation; its greatest elevation 3,200 feet above the sea.

The climate is very similar to that of St. Christopher, from which place it is separated by a strait of about two miles in breadth at its narrowest part, which however lies out of the direct course for boats plying between the two Islands—the distance between Bassetere (St. Christopher) and Charlestown (Nevis) being about twelve miles. A roughness of the sea occasionally prevents communication, and sudden and dangerous squalls often occur.

In 1866 (by Act 329), the constitution was simplified in the same manner as had then recently been adopted in St. Kitts and Antigua, and a single Chamber was established.

By an Act (No. 16 of 1877) to "Amend and simplify the Legislature of Nevis" the Assembly was abolished, and a Legislative Council established in its stead.

Anguilla.

Anguilla is about sixty miles N.W. of St. Christopher, and is sixteen miles in length, and varies in breadth from three to one and a half miles, containing an area of thirty-five square miles. The "Dogs" and neighbouring islands are dependencies of Anguilla.

The revenue of Anguilla may be estimated at £500, and the expenditure at about the same amount. The local courts for the administration of justice are the Magistrate's Court and the Small Debt Court. The island is also within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the Leeward Islands.

The island is extremely healthy, and the population is computed at 2,500, of whom 100 are white (or of pure European descent), and the remainder coloured or black.

Besides cattle, ponies, and garden stock, which last meets with a ready sale at St. Thomas, the productions are phosphate of lime and salt. In the latter commodities the trade is decidedly on the increase. The revenue is derived from import duties, licences, &c.
