BRITISH GUIANA.

Situation and Area.

This Colony is a portion of the South American Continent, extending from east to west about 200 miles. It includes the settlements of Demerara, Essequebo, and Berbice, and is bounded on the east by Dutch Guiana, from which it is divided by the River Corentyne, on the south by Brazil, on the west by Venezuela, and on the north and northeast by the Atlantic Ocean. Its area is about 109,000 square miles, extending from 9° to 1° north latitude, and from 57° to 62° west longitude. About 130 square miles only are under cultivation.

History and Constitution.

The territory was first partially settled by the Dutch West India Company in 1680. It was from time to time held by Holland, France, and England. It was restored to the Dutch in 1802, but in the following year retaken by Great Britain, and finally ceded to that power in 1814.

Under the Dutch, Demerara and Essequebo constituted one Government, and Berbice another, an arrangement which continued in force under the British Administration down to the year 1831.

The constitution of the Colony of Berbice dates from the year 1782; under it the Governor was nominated by the Directors of the Mercantile Body called the Berbice Association, and was assisted by a council of six. In 1826 an order of the King in Council was issued, dissolving the then Council of Government, appointing another, and thenceforward vesting the right of appointing to vacancies in the Governor as representing the Crown.

The Court of Policy for Demerara appears to have been established in 1773. In 1789 that for Essequebo was merged in it, and the seat of Government for the United provinces established at Stabroek, the site of the present capital Georgetown. Disputes having arisen between the Colonists, the local Government, and the West India Company, as to the right of appointing the colonial members of the Court of Policy, in the year 1788, a provisional "Plan of Redress," as it was termed (being in fact the draft of a new constitution), was framed by a Committee of the States-General, to whom had been referred sundry petitions of the Colonists. This being approved of, a commission was despatched by the States-General to the Colony, who on their arrival in 1789 dissolved the then existing Government, established a new one for the joined Colonies upon the basis of the scheme in question, which continued in operation, notwithstanding the captures of the Colony by the British in 1796 and in 1802, and its cession in 1803; the Articles of Capitulation having stipulated that the laws, usages, and institutions of the Colony should be maintained as before.

The Council or Court of Policy consisted of 1st, The Director-General; 2, The Commander of Essequebo; 3, The Fiscal of Essequebo; 4, The Fiscal of Demerara; 5 and 6, two Colonists from Essequebo; 7 and 8, two Colonists from Demerara.

In the first instance, the unofficial portion of the Council was to be chosen from a double nomination by the Colleges of Kiezers or Electors, of which there were two, one for each Colony, each consisting of seven Members, elected by a majority of the votes of the inhabitants possessing not fewer than twenty-five slaves, such votes to be in writing and signed by the voter. The tenure of

the Office of Kiezer, as subsequently defined by Proclamation of Sir Benjamin D'Urban in 1831, was to be for life, unless the party resigned, or ceased to be an inhabitant.

In 1795 it was deemed necessary, during a period of some confusion, to introduce four members "commissioned" by the Colleges of Electors of both Colonies to have, jointly with the Court of Policy, the administration of the public funds. In the following year, however, Governor Beaujon annulled this arrangement, and to secure to the inhabitants more ample control of taxation enacted that in lieu of the four above-mentioned, there should be six inhabitants adjoined to the Governor and Court of Policy, three from each Colony, to be elected by the inhabitants qualified as in the case of Kiezers, and to serve for two years, but with powers strictly limited to raising Colony taxes, and assisting in the audit of the public accounts.

Beaujon's proclamation was materially modified, though without affecting the definition of the duties of the financial representatives, by a proclamation of Acting Governor Carmichael in 1812, consolidating the two Colleges of Kiezers and Financial Representatives. This proclamation remained operative, though unconfirmed by the Crown, until, in 1831, when Sir Benjamin D'Urban became Governor of the United Colony, it was annulled by a Royal Instruction restoring the pre-existing arrangement, and extending the right of suffrage to the inhabitants of Berbice.

With an exception in regard to the franchise, to be noticed hereafter, this has been the usage and procedure till now, from which the inference has been drawn that the Financial Representatives had, and have, no authority whatever, except by express permission from the Crown, to discuss any item upon the estimate so as to alter its amount, although they might refuse to include any sum to which they objected in their calculations of the funds necessary to be raised by taxation.

The colonial members have never acquiesced in this interpretation of the constitution, and there have been frequent collisions between the Executive and Elective sections of the Court. The position they assume is based upon the construction of a passage in a decree of the States-General, dated 27th August, 1788, to the effect that "the contributions for the Colonial Chest are to be regulated by the inhabitants themselves;" and a passage in the instructions issued to Director-General Van Grovestein in 1793, "He will take care not to leave the administration of the Colony Chest wholly to the Colony Members of the Court of Policy, but will thereto admit a great number of the Colonists, for example the 'Kiezers of both rivers.' The nature of certain entries in the Minutes from 1798 to 1806 has also been held to support this contention.

In the year 1855 under the administration of Sir Philip Wodehouse, an Ordinance was passed to alter and amend the Political Institutions of the Colony, but it was not approved by Her Majesty. Since that time no legislation has been attempted in the same direction except the passing of Ordinance No. 1 of 1864, a declaratory act, defining the meaning of the term "Colonist," as employed in the "Plan of Redress" above noticed; and Ordinance

* Demerara and Essequebo only are here alluded to.

† During the discussions on the Civil List in 1848-9, it was suggested by some of the Elective Section to adopt this course, leaving upon the Governor the responsibility of paying the difference between the sums fixed and the amount provided.

‡ Proceedings relative to the Functions of the Financial Representative, 1832.
No. 16 of 1864, to remove some difficulties in the exercise of the functions of the College of Electors.

The Constitution may be summed up very briefly. It consists of a Governor, Court of Policy, and a Combined Court. The functions of an Executive and Legislative Council and House of Assembly are performed by the Governor and Court of Policy, except as regards taxation and finance, which are dealt with by the Combined Court, composed of the Governor and Members of the Court of Policy, combined with the six Financial Representatives. The Court of Policy passes all laws and ordinances, except the Annual Tax Ordinance, which is passed by the Combined Court.

The Court of Policy is composed of five official and five elective members. The official members are the Governor, the Attorney-General, the Government Secretary, the Auditor-General, and the Immigration Agent-General. The elective members are chosen as follows:—When a vacancy occurs the College of Electors meets and submits to the Court of Policy the names of two persons, from whom one is selected by the Court.

The elective franchise is regulated by Ordinance No. 15 of 1849. The Colony is divided into five Electoral Divisions, each of which has its representative in the College of Electors, chosen for life or during permanent residence in the Colony, and one or more Financial Representatives, elected for two years, and eligible for re-election. The number of registered electors is about 1,400.

In 1837 the first municipal body was incorporated, but the principle has not been materially extended in its application.

The existing municipal authorities are mayor and town council, Georgetown; and board of superintendence, New Amsterdam. Their aggregate revenue in 1888 was £53,772, their expenditure was £52,918, and their total debt at the end of the year was £52,269.

The Roman Dutch law is in force in civil cases, modified by Orders in Council and local Ordinances; the Criminal Law is now based on that of Great Britain, and is administered in the same manner, except that there is no Grand Jury.

Internal Communications.

The three rivers, Demerara, Essequibo, and Berbice, are navigable for 90, 35, and 150 miles respectively. There is a good network of roads, and there are small canals in connection with the Demerara River. There is a railway from Georgetown to Mahaica, about 21 miles in length, owned by the British Guiana Railway Company, Limited. Its receipts in 1888 were £32,080, its expenses £17,672. The line was constructed at a total cost of £280,000. The telegraph system, owned and worked by the Government, now comprises about 260 miles of line, with seven cables covering a distance of 12 miles. It is in connection with a cable to Trinidad, and thus with Europe and the United States. A telephone exchange is established at Georgetown in connection with the Government Telegraph; length of telephone lines 32 miles, longest line 4½ miles. There are lines of local steamers between Georgetown, New Amsterdam, and some stations on the rivers. A well organised postal service extends throughout the colony, letters reaching Pomeroon in 24 hours from Georgetown.

Education.

A state aided system of elementary education was established by Law No. 14 of 1876. The schools are denominational, except the Estates schools. The central administration is vested in the Inspector of Schools, and the local control conducted by managers, who are usually ministers of religion.

The number of schools receiving aid in 1888 was 159, with 21,384 scholars, and the aid granted amounted to £21,124.

Provision is made for higher education by a Government college in Georgetown, in which the course of instruction is similar to that of a public school or first grade grammar school in England, and there is awarded annually one public scholarship of the value of £200 per annum, tenable at a University in England for three years.

Currency and Banking.

Accounts are kept in dollars and cents. British sterling and United States gold coin is current and legal tender, as well as Spanish and Mexican gold. Spanish, Mexican, or Columbian dollars are no longer legal tender, under Ordinance No. 6 of 1876. There are also remaining some old silver tokens from one-eighth to three guilders (one guilder being equal to one shilling and fourpence).

The "Colonial" and "British Guiana" Banks have establishments at Georgetown, with branches at New Amsterdam. The deposits of the British Guiana Bank reached £289,678 on the 30th June, 1888, and it had a note circulation of £70,979. The total note circulation in the Colony is about £130,218.

The first Government savings banks were established at Georgetown and New Amsterdam in the year 1836. A branch bank was opened at Suddie, Essequebo, in 1879, at Belfield on the East Coast, Demerara, in 1884, and another at Fellowship on the West Coast, Demerara, in 1887. The total deposits amounted on 31st December, 1888, to £204,350 among 13,513 depositors.

Industry and Productions.

The staple products of British Guiana were in former years sugar, rum, molasses, cotton, and coffee. The soil of some parts of the Colony is capable of producing coffee of rare excellence, the Berbice River coffee being once much prized. The latter two industries have now given place to the cultivation of the sugar-cane, which at present is the chief industry of the Colony, and furnishes nearly ninety-two per cent, in value of its exports. Timber, charcoal, rice, and coco-nuts are also exported.

The forests abound in woods of rare beauty and value. Some of the hard woods are, from their remarkable durability, peculiarly suitable for house and shipbuilding purposes, while others are equally prized for the manufacture of household furniture.

There were 96 sugar estates in active operation in British Guiana in the year 1888, having an aggregate of sugar cane cultivation of 77,481 acres, and of plantain cultivation of 4,205 acres. The sugar crop for 1888 yielded about 120,185 hogsheads. The bulk of the production is the high class sugar known as Demerara crystals.

Further attention is being given to the planting of coffee and coco on the vegetable soils to the rear of the cane grove,* and several abandoned

* The cocoa estates are chiefly on Canal No. 1, West Bank of the Demerara River, and cocoa is grown on a small scale on some sugar estates aback of the cane cultivation. Coffee is grown principally in the country of Berbice, and the Liberian coffee bean has been planted with great success also on some estates on Canal No. 1.
coffee estates are being reclaimed. Rice is now grown to a considerable extent on the Coolie Settlement at "Huisst Dieren," and by Free Coolies on the Savannah lands behind the Sugar Estates.

Gold washing is now extensively carried on by about 2,000 diggers, 14,570 ozs. having been exported in 1888, valued at £55,566. The royalty received amounted to £2,937. India-rubber, ballata, and other gums are also exported.

The chief imports are rice, flour, machinery, dried fish, and manure.

Half the trade is with the United Kingdom, and a third with the United States; the other important countries being India, Canada, and the West Indies.

Climate.

The climate is hot, but not unhealthy. The mean temperature throughout the year is about 82° Far. The heat is greatly tempered by the cooling breezes from the sea, which prevail during the greater portion of the year. The heat is felt more in August and September than at other times, owing to the partial cessation of these breezes. There are annually two wet seasons, about Christmas and midsummer, for two months each. The annual rainfall is about 69 in. in Georgetown.

Towns.

The capital is Georgetown, situated in lat. 6° 49' 24" N., and long. 58° 11' 30" W., and possessing a population of upwards of 50,000. New Amsterdam has a population of 10,000. Both these are ports of registry, having on 31st December, 1888, 125 vessels, of a total tonnage of 6,106.

Means of Communication.

The regular mail communication with the Colony is maintained by the vessels of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, which leave Southampton every alternate Thursday, those of the Cie. Generale Transatlantique, from France and the West Indies, and the Dutch line from Holland and Havre, both monthly; and those of the Atlantic and West India line from New York every six weeks. There are other lines of steamers trading to the Colony which carry mails, but their periods of departure are uncertain.
