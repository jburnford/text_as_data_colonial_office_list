HONG KONG.

Situation and Area.

Hong Kong is one of a number of islands situated off the south-eastern coast of China, at the mouth of the Canton River, and lies about 40 miles east of Macao, between 22° 9' and 22° 17' N. lat., and 114° 5' and 114° 18' E. long. The island is an irregular ridge, stretching nearly east and west; its broken and abrupt peaks rising to the height of nearly 2,000 feet above the sea level. Its length is about 11 miles, its breadth from 2 to 5 miles, its area rather more than 29 square miles. It is separated from the mainland of China by a narrow strait, known as the Ly-ee-moon Pass, which does not exceed half a mile in width. The opposite peninsula of Kow-loon (24 square miles) was ceded to Great Britain by a Treaty entered into by Lord Elgin in 1861 with the Government of China and now forms part of the Colony; which also includes Stonecutter's, Green, Aplocow, Middle, Round, and other islets.

General Description.

The waterways of the Colony form one of the most magnificent harbours in the world, having an area of ten square miles. The granite hills which surround it rise between 3,000 and 4,000 feet high, the whole offering a coup d'œil which blends the wild scenery of Scotland with the classic beauty of Italy. The City of Victoria extends for four miles at the base of the hills which protect the south side of the harbour, and contains, with its suburbs, 200,000 inhabitants. Being built on the slope of the hills facing the sea, the general aspect of the town is perhaps more striking and picturesque from the water than that of any other city in the east, whilst many of the streets are shaded with well-grown and handsome trees.

The rainfall for 1888 was 105 inches at the Observatory Station, and 111 inches at the Victoria Peak, while the range of the thermometer was from 42° to 91°. The rainy season extends from May to October.

History.

The Colony, then a desolate island, sparsely inhabited by fishermen, was ceded to Great Britain in January, 1841; the cession was confirmed by the Treaty of Nankin, in August, 1842; and the charter bears date 5th April, 1843.

It did not become of much commercial importance until the discovery of gold in Australia, in 1851, and the consequent Chinese emigration. Its trade has gradually increased with the opening up of China to foreign trade.

Large local banking, dock, steamboat, and insurance companies were established between 1865 and 1872, and the trade was greatly increased by the opening of the Suez Canal.

Industry.

The island produces little or nothing, but its position has made it a centre of trade in many kinds of goods. Amongst the principal are opium, sugar, flour, salt, earthenware, oil, amber, cotton, and cotton goods, sandal-wood, ivory, betel, vegetables, live stock, granite, &c., &c. The transactions of the tea and silk trade are largely controlled by Hong Kong firms. There are a few manufactories, producing rope, sugar, rum, and bamboo work, and stores of every description for the supply of shipping.

As Hong Kong is a free port, it is impossible to give a correct return of imports and exports, but the enormous extent of the trade with which it is connected, may be approximately estimated from the amount of the shipping. The exports from the fourteen principal countries to Hong Kong amounted in 1885 to 21,863,145l., and the imports into those countries from Hong Kong were 18,635,181l. Nearly half of this trade is with China, and a third with India, mainly in tea, silk, and opium.

Hong Kong is well provided with dock accommodation. There are five docks and three slips which are well supplied with shears, engineer's and carpenter's shops, foundries, and every requirement for making repairs to large ships of war and merchant vessels. The Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock Company was aided by two loans from the British Government in 1864 and 1885 under The Colonial Docks Act.

Currency and Banking.

There is a colonial coinage of dollars and half dollars, and these, with Mexican and other full weight dollars, are alone legal tender; see Order in Council, 9th Jan., 1863; Ordinance, 1 of 1864; Governor's Proclamation in Hong Kong "Government Gazette," dated 14th Sept., 1866. There is also a colonial bronze coinage. Altogether nearly $3,000,000 has been issued in silver and bronze, about two-thirds of which is in circulation. There are four principal banks (New Oriental, Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, Chartered Mercantile Bank of India, London, and China, and Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank) having a note circulation of $5,617,475, on 31st Dec., 1888. There is no savings bank under Government control, but one conducted by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank. Five other banks have agencies in the Colony.

Means of Communication.

There is telegraphic communication with nearly the whole world by a cable to Shanghai (and thence to Japan and Russia) and two cables to Singapore via Saigon and Hué respectively; and there is very extensive steam communication with Europe, America, and Australia.

In addition to the regular mail lines of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Com-
pany and the Messageries Maritimes which convey the European mails weekly, the Pacific Mail Steam Navigation Company have a fortnightly service, via Yokohama, Japan, to San Francisco, and the Eastern and Australian Mail Steam Company and the China Navigation Company have a frequent service to the Australian Colonies. The Norddeutsche Lloyd and the Austrian Lloyd steamers go to and from Europe monthly, and the Canadian Pacific Steamship Company have a monthly service to Europe via Vancouver and the Canadian Pacific Railway.

There is daily steam communication between Hong Kong, Macao, and Canton, and almost daily with Swatow, Amoy, Foo Chow, Shanghai, and other ports on the coast of China. The communication with Japan is three or four times a week. There are no railways (but a cable tramway from the city to the higher levels was opened in 1888); and no internal telegraph communication except for police and military purposes. The island possesses few roads, and the usual means of conveyance outside Victoria is by boat. The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters per ½ oz |
|------------------|
| Hong Kong, Canton and Macao | 2 cents |
| China and Japan | 5 " |
| Europe and America | 10 " |
| Australasia and South Africa | 25 " |

**Education.**

There is the Victoria College, a central Government Boys' School, with low fees, a Police school and a Reformatory, 16 free Government schools (6 teaching English), and 20 aided Chinese village schools for boys. A Government Girls' School will be opened in 1890. Besides these, there are 68 grant-in-aid-schools, 63 of which are free, belonging to 10 different Missionary Societies. These are denominational, the Government schools being strictly secular. There were 6,258 children on the rolls in 1888, besides 1,989 in 107 private schools, mostly Chinese, which are not aided or inspected. The only central administrative organisation is the department of the Inspector of Schools. The languages taught are English, Portuguese, and three separate dialects of Chinese. Some scholarships have been founded by Government and by private individuals for higher education. There is no provision for industrial or technical education.

**Revenue.**

One-fourth of the revenue is derived from municipal rates for police, lighting, water and other purposes, 13 per cent. on the annual value in Victoria, and 7 per cent. in Kowloon and outlying villages, payable by the owners. The remainder is derived from opium and other licences, land revenue, stamps and fees.

**Defence.**

There is an Imperial garrison of about 1,300 men, towards the cost of which the Colony contributes 20,000l. annually. There is also a Volunteer Artillery Corps with 87 honorary and 70 effective members. The port is the head-quarters of the China Squadron, and there is usually at least one war vessel present. Land batteries of powerful armament have been erected with the view of protecting the town and anchorage. There is an armed police 700 strong, of whom 100 are Europeans, 200 Sikhs, and the rest Chinese.

**Constitution.**

The Government is administered under Letters Patent of 19 Jan., 1888, by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council, composed of six officials besides the Governor. The Legislative Council is presided over by the Governor, and is composed of six official and five unofficial members, three of whom are nominated by the Crown on the recommendation of the Governor (one being usually a Chinese), one is nominated by the Justices of the Peace from their body, and one by the Chamber of Commerce. By the provisions of the Vice-Admiralty Courts Act of 1863, the Governor is ex officio Vice-Admiral, and the Chief Justice ex officio Judge of the Vice-Admiralty Court. The English Common Law forms the basis of the legal system, modified by Colonial Ordinances. The law as to civil procedure was codified by an Ordinance of 1873.
