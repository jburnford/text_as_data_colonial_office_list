SARAWAK.

An agreement was entered into with the Rajah of Sarawak, on the north-west coast of Borneo, on 14th June, 1888, under which that State has been placed under British protection. Her Majesty's Government undertake not to interfere with the internal administration of the State, but they are to determine any questions that arise as to the succession, to control the foreign relations, and to have the right to establish consular officers in the territory. British subjects are to have most-favoured-nation treatment, and no part of the territory is to be alienated without the consent of H.M.'s Government.

The territory of Sarawak comprises an area of about 41,000 square miles, with a population of about 300,000, composed of various races. It is intersected by many rivers navigable for a considerable distance inland, and commands about 380 miles of coast line. The government of the district from Tanjong Datu to the entrance of the Samarahan river was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei in the year 1842 by Sir James Brooke, who became well known as Rajah Brooke, of Sarawak. In 1881 a second cession was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei of all the rivers and lands from the Samarahan river to Kadurong Point. In 1882 a third cession was obtained of 100 miles of coast line and all the country and rivers that lie between Kadurong Point and the Baram river, including about three miles of coast on the north-east side of the latter; and in 1885 another cession was obtained of the Truscan river, situated on the north of the mouth of the Brunei river. The present Rajah, H.H. Sir Charles Johnson Brooke, G.C.M.G., is a nephew of Sir James Brooke, to whom he succeeded in 1868. The country produces gold, diamonds, antimony, quicksilver, coal, gutta-percha, india-rubber, canes, rattans, camphor, bees' wax, birds' nests, sago, tapioca, pepper, gambier, and silver. The principal exports are gutta-percha, rattans, gambier, pepper, and sago flour. The bulk of the trade is with Singapore.

The principal towns are Kuching, the capital, situated on the Sarawak river, about 23 miles inland, lat. 1° 32' N., long.110° 28' R. (approximate); Bintulu, at the mouth of the Bintulu river; and Kabong, at the mouth of the Kalaka river.

The principal sources of revenue are the opium, gambling, arrack, and pawn farms, producing $186,000.

Harbour, buoy, and light dues:—Three cents per ton, payable on arrival, and chargeable to all vessels of five tons and upwards.

The taxes levied are:—Exemption, $2 per annum, payable by Malays; $1, or 1 pasu of rice, per annum per door, payable by sea dyaks; $2 per annum for every able-bodied land dyak.
