**MALTA.**

**Situation and Area.**

The Maltese Islands form a group in the Mediterranean Sea, about 58 miles from the nearest point of Sicily, 80 miles from Syracuse, and 142 from Reggio, and about 180 from the nearest point of the mainland of Africa. The length of Malta is about 17 miles, by 9 miles in breadth; its area is 91,557 square miles; that of Gozo, 24,804 square miles, and that of Comino about one square mile. Filfla and Cominotto are but islets. The whole group is about half the area of the Isle of Man.

**History.**

Of the islands of Malta, Gozo, and Comino mention is made at a very early date. The Phoenicians settled in them in B.C. 1519, according to some authors, whilst others give the date B.C. 1400. Diodorus Siculus describes Malta and Gozo as most important and prosperous Phoenician colonies. They were afterwards under the dominion of the Greeks, and then of the Carthaginians. During the Punic wars the Maltese Islands fell alternately to the lot of the Carthaginians and Romans, and were ultimately occupied by the latter. During the Roman occupation the shipwreck of St. Paul took place (Acts xxviii.). On the decline of the Roman Empire Malta fell into the hands of the Goths, and then into those of the Saracens, who were expelled in 1090 by Count Roger the Norman. It was under the dominion of the House of Aragon from 1190 until 1530, when it was granted by the Roman Emperor Charles V. to the Order of the Knights of St. John, by whom it was held for more than two centuries.

On the 12th July, 1798, the Grand Master Hompesch capitulated to Napoleon Bonaparte, who dispersed the Order. The Maltese, however, rose
against the French, and drove them to take refuge in the towns, where they were closely blockaded by the British fleet, aided by the Maltese, for two years. The French, reduced to extremities, surrendered to the British, and the government was placed in the hands of Great Britain, 1800, and finally annexed to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris, 1814.

Climate.

The climate of Malta is equable and very healthy in winter. In August the heat at the sea level approaches that experienced in the tropics. The nights, however, are pleasant and cool, except during the prevalence of the scirocco wind. The mean maximum temperature during the three coldest months (December, January, February) is 59° 8 Fahr., and the mean minimum 51° 5; but during the four hottest months (June, July, August, and September) the mean maximum is 81° 5 Fahr., and the mean minimum 71° 5. The mean temperature is 65° 7, and the mean annual rainfall is 20 inches. There is no river or rivulet in the island, the water drainage becoming absorbed in the porous sandstone beds and finding its way through underground channels and aqueducts.

Industry.

The island is highly cultivated. Besides products for home consumption, oranges and honey of superior quality and melons are largely exported. A large number of the inhabitants are employed in connection with the enormous trade of Valletta as a coaling station and an entrepôt and port of call. It is a port of registry, having, on 31st December, 1903, 107 vessels, of together 6,160 tons register. There is a large trade with Tunis, Tripoli, Algeria, Italy, and the Levant.

Chief Towns.

The population, according to the census of 1901, is 188,141, including garrison, Royal Navy, and merchant shipping. The chief town and capital is Valletta, having, with its suburbs of Floriana, Sliema, and St. Julian's, a population of 40,406 in 1901. The "Three Cities" on the other side of the harbour from Valletta (Senglea, Cospicua, and Vittoriosa) have a population of 17,492. Citta Vecchia, the old capital, is in the interior of the island, and, with its suburbs, had a population of 9,067 in 1901. The chief town of Gozo is Victoria (formerly called Rabat), population 5,057.

Inhabitants.

The inhabitants of the country districts resemble the southern Italians in appearance, and in some districts show distinct traces of their Punic descent. In the towns and among the upper classes are to be found representatives of families who have settled in Malta from many different countries. The Maltese dialect, which is generally spoken, is of Semitic origin, and is held to be derived from the Carthaginian and Arabic tongues. The educated and commercial classes usually speak also Italian or English, or both. The Maltese are remarkably thrifty, hard-working, and industrious. They are excellent seamen and mechanics; large numbers of them are to be found as traders in Tunis, Egypt, and around the Mediterranean coast.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is, under Order in Council of September 24th, 1886, exclusively British. There are two local banks (Banoo di Malta and Anglo-Maltese Bank), and a branch of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank. The first two banks have a small note circulation, reported to amount to about 27,000l., and the amount of current and fixed deposit accounts in the three banks is estimated at from 700,000l. to 800,000l. The Government savings bank, established in 1833, had, on 31st March, 1905, 585,869l. deposits.

Means of Communication.

There is a railway, 8 miles in length and 3 feet 3 in. gauge, now belonging to the Malta Government, which was originally built by the Malta Railway Company at the cost of about 90,000l. An electric tramway and a motor-omnibus service has recently been inaugurated, connecting the principal towns and villages with Valletta. There are 65 miles of telegraph, constructed and worked by the military authorities, but open to public use. Valletta has an extensive telephone system and is a station of the Eastern Telegraph Company, with direct cables Alexandria (3), Gibraltar (3), Bone (2), Messina (1), Tripoli (1), and Zante (1).

It is a port of call for nearly all the Mediterranean lines of steamers, and is a most important coaling station, facilities being given for coaling in quarantine, and at any hour, day and night, and for ensuring the delivery of full weight of bunker coals when owners call for a Custom House certificate of weight. There is direct mail communication with nearly every Mediterranean port several times per week, and with England, via Italy, daily, except on Sundays. The rates of postage are as follows:

**Public Works.**

The drainage of the fortified towns, which was commenced in 1876 at the joint charge of the Colonial and Imperial Treasuries, was completed in 1885, and has greatly improved their sanitary condition. New drainage works, partly at the joint expense of the Colonial and Imperial Governments, were commenced in 1899, and Sliema, St. Julians, Misida, Pietà, Hainrun, Curmi, and

---

* See list at end of Introduction. A new rate on parcels exchanged with the U.K. (by direct steamer) came into force on the 1st of Jan., 1899.
Rabate have already been drained, while several important alterations in the drainage of the fortified towns have been effected. The drainage works will be gradually extended to all the villages of Malta and Gozo, and the installation of a system for flushing all the sewers by sea water has been taken in hand. The reorganisation of the water supply, hitherto very defective, has also been taken in hand, and considerable waterworks have been established for raising and distributing at high pressure an effective supply of pure water for all purposes. These works have now been extended to all the large villages and to Gozo. Considerable progress has also been made lately in improving the roads and streets and in public lighting. Electric lighting has been installed, and is being worked in Valletta, Floriana, the Three Cities, including the Great Harbour and Marsamuscetto Harbour and Sliema.

**Constitution.**

The Government is administered by a Governor, advised and assisted by an Executive Council, established in 1881, re-constituted in 1887, and again in 1903. It now consists of eleven members besides the President. Legislation is carried on by means of a partly-elective Council of Government originally constituted by Letters Patent of 11th May, 1849; re-constituted by Letters Patent of 12th Dec., 1887 (amended in 1898); and again by Letters Patent of 3rd June, 1903. It now consists of ten official members and eight elected, besides the President and a Vice-President. Public officers are ineligible for election, and no ecclesiastical person is capable of being elected a member of the Council. The islands are divided into eight electoral districts, returning one member each. The total number of electors is a little under 10,000. The qualifications for a member of Council are, his qualification to be registered as an elector, and the possession of immoveable property of the clear value of 100l. for twelve calendar months previous to election; or the payment of rent for immoveable property to the annual value of 10l. for twelve calendar months previous to election; or the payment of 40l. a year for board and lodging; or £10 a year for his lodging only for the same period previous to election. The qualifications for an elector are the age of twenty-one years, British nationality, and either an income from immoveable property of 6l. per annum, or the payment of rent to the amount of 6l. per annum for six calendar months before registration, or qualification to serve as a common juror. The Council of Government, unless sooner dissolved, lasts three years. The Governor is ex-officio President, but neither he, nor the Vice-President or other presiding member has either an original or a casting vote. A Vice-President was first appointed by Letters Patent, dated 6th February, 1893. The Governor, or the Vice-President, if present, may depute an official member to preside. There are no municipalities or other forms of local government.

**Education and Religion.**

Elementary education is carried on almost exclusively in Government schools, which are Roman Catholic and free. There are two secondary schools with 228 scholars, and 144 elementary and infants' schools, including 48 infant departments, and 33 night schools, with 18,948 pupils, and an average attendance of 14,206 in both day and night schools. There is a public lyceum with 536 scholars, and a university (founded in 1769) with 147 students. At these two latter institutions the fees are extremely low, being respectively 4s. and 10s. per family per quarter. There are numerous private secondary schools. The total number of these schools is 119, with 4,342 scholars. Education is not compulsory. The Roman Catholic religion is universal amongst the Maltese.

**Defence.**

Malta is the principal naval station in the Mediterranean, and is strongly fortified. Valletta is defended by massive and extensive works. The garrison consisted, on the 31st March, 1905, of 12,096 of all ranks. The Island Government pays 5,000l. as military contribution.

**Revenue.**

There is no direct taxation of any kind. The most important sources of revenue are the Customs duties, stamp duty, port dues, and land revenue.

**Weights and Measures.**

Malta barrel is equal to 9½ imperial gallons.

,, salm ,, 1 quarter.

,, cantar ,, 175 lbs. English.

,, caffiso ,, 4½ imperial gallons.

The transit trade (of grain, alcohol, cattle, etc., not landed) amounted, in addition, to 8,400,028l. in 1904-5. There is also a large trade in nondutiable goods. The total imports for local consumption are probably about 2,300,000l. annually, and the total exports about 250,000l.

**Public Debt.**

There is, strictly speaking, no public debt in Malta, but interest at 2½% is paid by the Government on 79,168l. invested in the Massa Frumentaria.
