BRITISH EAST AFRICA PROTECTORATE.

The East Africa Protectorate extends from the Umba to the Juba River, and inland as far as the borders of Uganda. It includes certain mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar—viz., a strip extending 10 miles inland along the coast from the German frontier to Kipini, the islands of the Lamu Archipelago, and an area of 10 miles round the port of Kisimayu, these territories having been leased to Great Britain for an annual rent of 17,000l. The original concession was made to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1895 to His Majesty's Government, and the whole Protectorate is placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. It was transferred on April 1st, 1905, from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. The frontiers have been defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891). The Protectorate consists of seven provinces and a tract of territory not yet organised lying to the north-west. The provinces are each under a Sub-Commissioner, and are divided into districts and sub-districts as follows: Seyidie (capital, Mombasa), comprising the districts of Vanga, Mombasa, Malindi and Taita, and the sub-districts of Rabai, Takaungu and Taveta; Ukambe (capital, Nairobi), including the districts of Kitui, Kiliryu, South Masailand and Ulu; Tanaliland (capital, Lamu), with districts of Lamu and Tana River; Jubaland (capital, Kisimayu), consisting of the districts of Upper and Lower Jubaland; Kenya (capital, Fort Hall), with districts of Fort Hall and Nyeri; the Naivasha Province (capital, Naivasha), including the districts of Naivasha, Eldama Ravine, North Masailand and Baringo; the Kisumu Province (capital, Kisumu or Port Florence), including the districts of Kisumu, Elgon, Nandi and Kericho, and the sub-districts of Lumbwa and Karungu. The two provinces last named were formerly the Eastern Province of Uganda, but were transferred to the East African Protectorate on April 1st, 1902.

The Protectorate has an area of about 200,000 square miles. The total population is estimated at 2,000,000, including 25,000 Asiatics and 2,000 Europeans and Eurasians. On the coast the Arabs and Swahilis predominate; further inland are races speaking Bantu languages, and non-Bantu tribes, such as the Masai, the Somalis and the Gallas. Mombasa is the largest town and also the capital of the whole Protectorate; the inhabitants number about 25,000. It is situated on an island of the same name, possessing two fine harbours, one at Mombasa itself and the other at Kilindini, the latter having a pier connected with the Uganda Railway. The second largest, and perhaps the most important, town in the Protectorate is Nairobi, the capital of the Ukamba Province and the central station on the Uganda Railway. The inhabitants number 7,000, of whom 600 are Europeans or Eurasians, and 1,600 Indians.

The prevailing religious beliefs are Pagan, but on the coast Mohammedanism has made great progress. There are in the Protectorate many Christian mission stations, representing eleven different societies—British, French, German, Italian, Swedish and American, two of them being Roman Catholic. At these stations are schools for elementary instruction and handicrafts. Legislation is by Ordinances made by the Commissioner, the Indian codes being followed as far as applicable. Justice is administered by courts at Zanzibar and Mombasa, and by inferior courts where administrative officers or magistrates preside. In all cases to which natives are parties local ideas and customs are considered. On the ten-mile coast strip domestic slavery is legal, but is practically extinct. No one born after August 1st, 1890, can be a slave, and the purchase of slaves is prohibited. In the rest of the Protectorate slavery is non-existent. The military force consists of 24 officers and 1,000 men, forming the 3rd Battalion of the King's African Rifles; the 1st Battalion is also in the Protectorate proper. There are 1,800 police, under 27 European officers and non-commissioned officers.

Products and Trade.

The agricultural products of the lowlands are cocoa-nuts, rice, maize, and various native grains; cotton and tobacco are also being cultivated. Experiments with a view to a large extension of cotton growing are being made, and the introduction of other seeds and plants of economic value is being tried. In the highlands potatoes grow freely, and are now exported; coffee, wheat and barley are successfully cultivated, but not yet on a large scale. On the uplands enormous pasture grounds are available for cattle.

The forest products of the coast are rubber, gum-copal and timber. Mangroves grow on the coast, acacia and ebony in the scrub forests further inland. The highlands forests yield rubber, fibres and castor-oil beans, and contain croton, olive, fig and several good timber trees. The greater part of the forest area is quite unexplored, though a large syndicate has now obtained a concession for cutting timber, and is surveying the forest north of the railway.

The mineral resources of the Protectorate are not yet well ascertained, but iron is known to occur abundantly in most districts; mica and graphite are found in Ukamba; limestone is worked near Kitui, Makindu and Lake Victoria; opals are common in the Rift Valley; a large deposit of carbonate of soda has been found in the south part of Ukamba; gold mining began, but was discontinued. Recent concessions include prospecting rights, the working of pearl fisheries in the Lamu, Malindi and Wasin districts, and grants of agricultural and grazing land. A return of land leased and sold within the Protectorate in 1904 puts the area disposed of at 507,000 acres (freehold, 50,924; leasehold, 456,076), subdivided as follows:

- Agricultural: 49,000 acres
- Grazing: 362,000 "
- Fibre: 32,000 "
- Forest: 64,000 "

Total 507,000

The value of the imports (exclusive of railway material, administration stores, and specie) and of the exports, the amount of the customs receipts at the eight ports, and the tonnage entered at Mombasa and Kilindini in five years were (rupee 16d.), as follows:

| Year    | Imports | Exports | Customs | Tonnage |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|         | £       | £       | £       |         |

| 1904-05 | 518,143 | 234,664 | 60,293  | 736,603 |

The chief exports were ivory, copra, grains, hides and skins, and rubber. Of the imports the value of 165,484£ (32 per cent.) came from the United Kingdom; 143,394£ (27·7 per cent.) from India and Burmah; 54,030£ (10·4 per cent.) from Germany. Of the exports the value of 36,834£ (15·7 per cent.) went to the United Kingdom; and 30,546£ (13 per cent.) to Zanzibar; 21,019£ (8·9 per cent.) to France; 22,343£ (9·6 per cent.) to Germany; 78,911£ (33·6 per cent.) to the United States of America.

Mombasa is visited by the steamers of four lines. Those of the British India Company, the Austrian-Lloyd Company from Trieste and the Messageries Maritimes call monthly; those of the German East Africa line, and those of a branch of this line from Bombay and Rangoon, call fortnightly. Communication between the ports of the Protectorate is maintained by a steamer belonging to the Administration.

The Uganda (Mombasa-Victoria) Railway is worked as a State Railway of the East Africa Protectorate. Its length is 584 miles, with a gauge of one metre. The construction cost to March 31st, 1905, was 5,404,920£ (approximate). The telegraph is worked by the East Africa Protectorate Postal Department at the principal stations, and at smaller stations by the railway staff. Two steamers on the Lake are also worked in connection with the railway. In 1904-5 (exclusive of railway material) 23,717 tons of goods, 6,195 head of live stock, and 71,680 passengers were carried.

Earnings as follows:

| Item     | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Railway  | 138,641|
| Steamers | 14,466 |
| Telegraphs | 686   |

Total expenditure 151,153£.

The railway zone extends one mile on either side. The Revenue from rents in 1904-5 amounted to 1,988£.

The Post Office of the Protectorate is united with the Uganda Post Office. The total number of letters, packets, etc., in the East Africa Protectorate amounted in 1904-5 to 1,163,759, the number of telegrams to 42,031. This latter includes 7,680 telegrams despatched from the Uganda Railway Telegraph Offices. The three telegraph lines, Mombasa to Lamu, Mombasa to Kisumu (along the railway), and Kisumu to Entebbe (in Uganda), have a total length of 1,006 miles. There is also a telegraph line 18 miles in length from Londiani to Eldama Ravine. The Entebbe-Hoima-Masindi (Uganda) line has 293 miles open. The Eastern Telegraph Company has a cable connecting Mombasa with Zanzibar.
