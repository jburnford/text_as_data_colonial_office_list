Natal.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of Natal derives its name from its discovery by Vasco da Gama, the celebrated Portuguese navigator, on Christmas Day, 1497. It lies on the south-east coast of Africa, about 800 miles from the Cape of Good Hope, and between the 26th and 32nd parallels of S. lat. It is bounded on the north by the Portuguese possessions and the Transvaal, on the west by the Orange River Colony and Basutoland, and on the south by the Cape Colony and Umtamvuna River. It comprises an area of 35,371 square miles, and has a seaboard of 376 miles. It is a well-watered country, no less than 35 distinct rivers running into the Indian Ocean in the 376 miles of coast. Unfortunately none of them are navigable. The capital, Pietermaritzburg, has a population of 31,199, exclusive of H.M.'s troops; the largest town and only port is Durban, with 69,903 inhabitants, of whom 19,079 are natives, 2,041 mixed and others, and 15,857 Indians, and other Asiatics, and 32,926 whites.

History.

From the discovery of Natal by Vasco da Gama, in 1497, but little is to be found respecting it until 1686, when a Dutch vessel was wrecked in the Bay of Natal. The Dutch formed a settlement in 1721, but soon abandoned it.

In 1824 Lieutenant Farewell, of the Royal Navy, having in the previous year visited Natal on an exploring voyage endeavoured to colonise it. Chaka, a chief of the greatest talent, who had fused into a nation under his own despotic sway the various tribes inhabiting a vast tract of country, sanctioned the formation of a settlement by this small band of white men, which, however, was broken up about four years later.

Towards the close of 1837 a large body of Dutch Boers from the Cape Colony, taking offence at restrictions placed on them by the British Government in regard to their coloured servants, migrated to Natal. Many of them were treacherously murdered by Dingaan, then Zulu chief, the murderer of, and successor to, his brother Chaka. For two years the Zulus and the Boers waged war with varied success; but in 1839 the Dutch obtained a decisive victory, and placed Panda, an ally of theirs, and brother of Dingaan, on the Zulu throne.

Owing chiefly to these disturbances, the Governor of the Cape decided to take military possession of the district, and sent there a force under Captain Smith (1842). These troops came into collision with the Dutch Boers, were defeated by them, forced to entrench themselves, and completely blockaded until the arrival of considerable reinforcements under Colonel Cloete. The Boers submitted, on the 5th July, to Colonel Cloete at Pietermaritzburg.

In consequence of the outbreak of war between the Transvaal and Orange Free States on one side and Her Majesty's Government on the other Natal was invaded by the Boer forces in Oct., 1899.

* There was formerly another British settlement named Natal, a factory of the East India Company on the west coast of Sumatra, founded 1751, and finally abandoned until the cession of Sumatra to the Dutch in 1824.

† Natal, 17,979 square miles, Province of Zululand, 10,461, New Territory (Utrecht, Vryheid, Paulpisterburg, Ngotahe, Babanango), 6,891 square miles.

‡ Natal, 168 miles, Province of Zululand, 210 mls.
The first important engagement took place at Dundee, the Boers being repulsed by an advanced British force under Sir W. Penn Symons, who was mortally wounded. The British troops, under General Yule, then fell back upon Ladysmith, and rejoined the main army of defence under Sir G. White, who in the meantime had gained a decided victory over a Boer commando at Elandslaagte. Ladysmith was invested by a largely superior Boer army on the 28th October. Ladysmith was relieved by the British forces under Sir R. Buller at the end of February, 1900, and the Boers were cleared out of Natal in the course of the following few months, the British advancing into the Transvaal, where Lord Roberts was already operating with an invading army. It was not, however, until the signature of the terms of surrender by the Boer leaders on the 31st May, 1902, that peace was generally restored throughout South Africa, and that Natal was relieved from all further danger from the Boer forces remaining in the field up to that date.

Zululand and Amutongaland.

The Zulus are a warlike tribe who, in the beginning of the century, under Chaka, pressed southwards and became consolidated into a powerful and well-organised kingdom. Chaka was murdered and was succeeded by Dingaan in 1828, who came into conflict with the emigrant Dutch, by whom he was deposed in 1839, in favour of his brother Panda. In the latter years of Panda Zululand was distracted by the rival ambitions of his sons, and the Natal Government in 1861 sent Mr. (now the late Sir) Theophilus Shepstone, Secretary for Native Affairs, on a mission to Zululand, to induce the Zulus to recognise some one of Panda's sons as heir to his throne, and thus restore tranquillity to the country. The son chosen, with the consent of the nation, the king, and the Natal Government, was Cetywayo, who from that time acted to a great extent as regent for his father until the latter died in 1873. Cetywayo, at the instance of Mr. Shepstone, proclaimed certain new laws, which in effect came to this, that he was not to kill his subjects without adequate cause and without trial. The relations between Cetywayo and Natal during the first years of his reign were not unfriendly, though they became occasionally strained through disregard by him of his coronation law. But after the annexation by England of the Transvaal, a material change in the relations of the two Powers took place. Cetywayo had long hated the Boers, with whom he had a boundary dispute, dating from 1861, and after the annexation his enmity appeared to be transferred to the new Government. The Zulu war party wanted at once to occupy the whole territory in dispute, and a collision between the Zulus and the British Government of the Transvaal appeared imminent, but was averted by the suggestion of Sir Henry Bulwer, Lieutenant-Governor of Natal, to refer the dispute to the arbitration of three Commissioners to be selected by himself. This was accepted, both by Sir T. Shepstone, as Governor of the Transvaal, and by Cetywayo, and approved by Her Majesty's Government; the final award being, however, by them reserved to Sir B. Frere as Her Majesty's High Commissioner in South Africa. The Natal Commission reported, in June, 1878, in favour of the claims of the Zulu king, and in September Sir B. Frere arrived in Natal and took up the consideration of the boundary dispute, and also of our general relations with the Zulus, which were becoming more and more strained. On the 16th of December his award in the arbitration was delivered to the representatives of the Zulu nation at the Lower Tugela Drift. At the same time Cetywayo was required to introduce some modification of his administration, especially as regards military service, and to surrender certain refugees from Natal, and pay a fine for harbouring them, and for border outrages by his subjects.

The king not having complied, the further enforcement of the demands was confided to Lieut.-General Lord Chelmsford, whose forces advanced into Zululand in three columns between the 11th and 14th of January, 1879. On the 22nd of January two engagements were fought; one at Isandhlwana, the other at Inyezane; the former with disastrous, the latter with doubtful, results to the British. On the same night part of the Zulu impi crossed the Buffalo and attacked the commissariat and hospital post of Rorke's Drift, held by one company of the 24th Regiment. The post was without defences; but the officer in command, Lieut. Chard, R.E., V.C., with great rapidity and skill converted the stores themselves into a defence, and throughout the whole night the little garrison, behind a flimsy rampart of rice bags and biscuit boxes, successfully maintained an heroic defence.

In the meantime, the northern column, under Colonel (now Sir Evelyn) Wood, continued to engage and harass the enemy. Even in this part, British arms were not free from disaster at the Intombi River, and in a reconnaissance at the Hloblane Mountain; but immediately after the whole Zulu army, numbering 24,000 men, having attacked Wood's camp at Kambula Kop, suffered a severe defeat.

At the beginning of April, reinforcements having begun to arrive from England and the neighbouring colonies, Lord Chelmsford advanced across the Lower Tugela to the relief of Colonel Pearson, who was shut up in Eshowe; defeated the enemy at Ginginholo on the 2nd of April, and relieved the garrison.

The military power of the Zulu kingdom was finally broken to pieces at the battle of Ulundi on the 4th of July, and Cetywayo fled to the bush with a few followers. The people accepted their defeat with singular calmness, at once returning to their usual avocations. Chief after chief submitted, and Cetywayo himself was captured. The dynasty of Chaka was deposed, and the country was divided into thirteen districts, each under an independent chief, holding office by the gift of the Queen of England, subject to certain conditions accepted by him; a British resident was appointed to reside in Zululand, and be the adviser of the chiefs and channel of communication between them and the British Government.

Difficulties were soon experienced in working this arrangement. Some of the chiefs quarrelled and fought with one another and with their subjects, many of whom refused to recognise their authority; while a large and influential party were anxious for the restoration of Cetywayo. Sir H. Bulwer, who had assumed the government of Natal in the early part of 1882, was specially commissioned to inquire into the whole question of the Zulu settlement. After fully considering his report, Her Majesty's Government decided to replace the ex-king over the whole country north of the Umhlatusi River, with the exception of a small territory in the north-east, which Usibepu, one of
the thirteen chiefs appointed by Sir Garnet Wolseley, was allowed to retain. The territory between the Umhlatusi and the Natal frontier was constituted a native reserve, under the supervision of a British commissioner, and it was arranged that locations should be provided in this reserve for any of the Zulus who might be unwilling to again submit to the restored king. Cetywayo, who had at his own request been allowed to visit England, where the decision of the Government was communicated to him, and by him formally accepted, was reinstalled by Sir Theophilus Shepstone on the 29th January, 1883, in the presence of 5,000 Zulus.

His enemies, headed by Usibepu, proved more formidable than he or others had anticipated, and after a struggle of some months he was overthrown and his kraal destroyed. He took refuge in the Reserve, where he lived practically under the care of the Resident, until the 8th of February, 1884, when he died. Soon after his death his followers, the Usutu, finding themselves no match for Usibepu, called in some Boer adventurers, with whose assistance they inflicted a crushing defeat on Usibepu, who took refuge in the Reserve. And as a reward for this service the Boers received a grant of land, in which they established the "New Republic."

Finding that the Zulu people were unable to form any orderly administration of the remaining territory, Her Majesty's Government decided, with the general assent of the Zulus, to declare their country to be British territory, which was done in May, 1887. Some disturbances occurred soon after in connection with an attempt to set up Dinizulu, a son of Cetywayo, as king; but it was soon checked, and Dinizulu and some of his indunas were removed to St. Helena, while others were imprisoned or fined. Dinizulu and his two uncles Ndaduko and Ishingana were permitted to return from exile at the beginning of 1898.

In 1890 the districts of Fokotu, Umjindi, and Manaba, were proclaimed part of Zululand.

In 1896 the territories of the Chiefs Umbegiza and Sambana, in extent 668 square miles, lying between Zululand and Swaziland, the Portuguese territories, and Tongaland, were annexed to Zululand.

By Government Notice, dated 11th June, 1896, a British Protectorate was declared over the territory of Amatongaland, also called Amaputaland, which is about 1,200 square miles in area, and is bounded on the north by Portuguese possessions, on the west and south by Zululand, and on the east by the Indian Ocean. Under the Anglo-Portuguese Convention, signed at Lisbon on 11th June, 1891, the spheres of influence of Great Britain and Portugal over the country occupied by the Tongas was defined by a line following the parallel of the confluence of the River Pongola with the River Maputa to the sea coast. The boundary then agreed upon was surveyed in 1896, and laid off by a joint commission appointed by the British and Portuguese Governments.

In November, 1897, a Bill was introduced into the Natal Parliament to provide for the annexation of Zululand to Natal, and became law. A Proclamation was issued by the Governor on the 30th December, giving effect to the annexation from that date. The British Amatongaland Protectorate had been previously annexed to the Queen's dominions, and were incorporated with Zululand on the 27th December, 1897.

An Act was passed in 1902, providing for the annexation to Natal of certain territories hitherto forming part of the Transvaal, and the Commission appointed to report as to the new boundaries. The new territory was annexed to Natal in January, 1903, and is divided into the five Magisterial divisions of Vryheid, Utrecht, Paulpietersburg, Ngotsbe, and Babanango. The population at the census of April 17th, 1904, was 5,754 Europeans (mostly Dutch), 45 mixed and others, 5 Indians and Asiatics, 4,104 Natives in service, and 86,911 Natives in native areas: total 96,819. This territory represents an area of 6,931 square miles.

**Constitution.**

In 1843 the district of Natal was proclaimed by the Governor of the Cape to be a British Colony. In May, 1844, Letters Patent were issued, constituting the district a part of the Cape Colony. Ordinances were passed by the Cape Legislature establishing Roman-Dutch law, and providing for the administration of justice. In April, 1845, other Letters Patent were passed making Natal a separate Government. A Lieutenant-Governor was appointed, and an Executive Council created. The Lieutenant-Governor was subordinate to the Governor of the Cape, and the Legislative Council of the Cape continued to frame laws for Natal till 1847, when a separate Legislative Council was established.

In 1856 Natal was erected into a distinct and separate Colony, its affairs being administered, under the Royal Charter of the 15th July of that year, by a Governor, assisted by an Executive and a Legislative Council.

The law establishing responsible government (The Constitution Act of 1893) received the Royal Assent on the 26th June, 1893, and on the 10th October, 1893, the first Ministry was appointed.

The Ministry as at present constituted consists of:

- Prime Minister, who is also Colonial Secretary,
- Minister of Railways and Harbours,
- Minister of Justice, also Minister of Education,
- Secretary for Native Affairs and Minister of Public Works,
- Minister of Agriculture,
- Colonial Treasurer,

all of whom must hold seats in either the Legislative Council or the Legislative Assembly, but not more than two may be members of the Legislative Council.

In place of the Legislative Council as previously existing, a Legislative Council and a Legislative Assembly are constituted.

The Legislative Council, consisting of thirteen members, is summoned by the Governor in Council. The members are summoned from the following districts of the Colony:—Five from within the counties of Durban, Victoria, Alexandra, and Alfred; three from within the counties of Pietermaritzburg and Umtati; three from within the counties of Weenen and Klip River; one from the Province of Zululand; and one from the New Territory; but not more than two members may be chosen from within any one county.

Each member holds his seat for ten years from the date of his summons, but five of the members first summoned vacate their seats at the end of five years.

No person may be summoned as a Member of the Legislative Council unless he be the registered proprietor of immovable property within the Colony of the value of 500L in net value.

The Legislative Assembly is an elective body, and consists of 43 Members who must be duly qualified and registered electors, chosen by the
electors of the several electoral districts, of which there are 17 in the Colony. The number of electors registered in 1904 was 18,944.

The duration of the Legislative Assembly is limited to four years from the date of the return of the writs of election, but the Governor may dissolve the Assembly whenever he may think fit.

The laws relating to the mode of election, the qualifications of electors, and to all other matters concerning elections, in force at the time of the passing of the Act, apply to the election of Members to serve in the Legislative Assembly. Under the Act No. 10 of 1898, provision is made for the Parliamentary representation of the Province of Zululand.

The reserved Civil List attached to the Constitution Act (No. 14, 1893), includes 2,900l. for pensions to officers retired on account of the change in the Constitution, and also 8,200l. for the salaries of the Governor and Ministers, 600l. for an Under Secretary for Native Affairs, and 10,000l. for the promotion of the welfare and education of the natives.

Members are not paid, but those residing more than two miles from the seat of Government receive 1l. per day travelling allowance. The session is usually from April to July or August.

Every male inhabitant who possesses property to the value of 50l., or is in receipt of rents from property of an annual value of 10l., or who has been a resident in the Colony, and whose income, inclusive of allowances, is equal to 8l. per month, is entitled to vote.

Local Government.

There are municipal corporations in Durban, Maritzburg, Newcastle, Ladysmith, and Dundee, and local boards in Verulam, Greytown, Utrecht and Vryheid. Their total revenue in 1904 was 827,775l., their expenditure 720,086l., and their debt 2,953,346l.

Native Affairs.

In 1872, Langalibalele, chief of the Amahlubi Tribe, residing in a location at foot of the Drakensberg Mountains, rebelled and escaped into Basutoland with his people and cattle. A Colonial force was dispatched against the tribe, and Langalibalele and many of the tribe were secured in Basutoland and given up. Langalibalele, his sons, indunas, and certain of his tribe were brought to trial under "native law." About 290 prisoners were condemned to various terms of imprisonment. Langalibalele himself was condemned to banishment or transportation for life, and one of his sons to a similar punishment for five years. The cattle and land of the tribe were confiscated. Langalibalele and his sons were transported to the Cape of Good Hope. They were allowed to return to Natal in 1886.

The native population had until then been governed chiefly under the authority of Ordinance No. 3 of 1849, which withdrew them from the authority of the Roman-Dutch Law, and placed them under the personal authority of the Governor as Supreme Chief, and made native law and custom the measure of justice among them in civil and criminal matters, a concurrent jurisdiction being reserved to the ordinary law courts in cases of crime mala in se. The native population was debarred from the franchise by a Law, No. 11 of 1865; but at the same time, and by the same Law, regulations were laid down by which any native may in certain cases apply to the Governor for a certificate entitling him to the privilege.

Subsequently, by a Law, No. 28 of 1865, machinery was provided by which a native might procure his relief from the operation of native law.

It was decided to supersede very gradually the tribal organisation, and the judicial and other authority of the chiefs. A law (No. 26 of 1875) established a Native High Court to administer civil justice to the natives, and placed them under the ordinary criminal law of the Colony, except as regards political crimes, crimes arising out of native customs, and crimes declared triable under any local law by native law, all which crimes are reserved for the Native High Court. By Act No. 13, 1895, the Native High Court and the Court established by Law No. 10, 1876, were abolished, and the jurisdiction of these courts transferred to the Supreme and Circuit Courts, and in certain cases to the Magistrates' Courts. As it was found, however, that this arrangement did not work as well as had been anticipated, the Native High Court was re-established under Act No. 49, 1898, with effect from 1st July, 1899. Certain locations were specially reserved by Government, and vested in the Natal Native Trust, for the exclusive occupation by natives. But besides the natives occupying these lands there are many native squatters on Crown lands, and many living by regular labour on farms. By Law No. 13 of 1875 a tax of 5l. on native marriages was abolished, while at the same time the native hut tax was raised from 7s. to 14s. Under Law No. 41 of 1884, a rent of 1l. per hut was imposed upon natives living on Crown lands. This was raised by Act No. 48 of 1903 to 2l. per hut per annum.

The area vested in the Native Trust, for occupation by natives, is 2,236,116 acres. The land (127,716 acres) formerly held by certain religious missions in trust for the natives having, by Act No. 49 of 1903, been transferred to the Natal Native Trust.

With the exception of the District of Proviso B, which is occupied by Boer farmers, and the townships of Melmoth, Osborn, Nondweni and Eshowe, all the lands in the Province of Zululand are vested in the Crown.

Climate and Inhabitants.

The climate varies, but is usually mild, cool, and bright. On the coast it is semi-tropical.

The rainy season is from October to March inclusive, during which thunderstorms are frequent and severe. There is no malaria in the colony. The death rates of Europeans or whites, including those classed in the Census returns
as mixed and others, at Pietermaritzburg and Durban for 1904 were 14·77 and 12·61 per thousand respectively, and for the Colony 10·89.

About 82 per cent. of the inhabitants are Zulu natives, and about 9 per cent. are Indian coolies. The Europeans number 97,109, or 8·8 per cent., of whom about 12,500 are Dutch, the rest being chiefly British, with the exception of about 4,500 colonists of German descent, of whom the greater portion are settled in the New Hanover and Lower Umzimkulu divisions.

Means of Communication.

There is a weekly mail service with England (20 to 22 days), with the Cape and Inland Colonies daily, with Mauritius and East Coast ports (Inhambane, Chiloane, Beira, Mozambique, Ibo, etc.) once or twice a month, with Delagoa Bay six times a month or more frequently, with Australia fortnightly, and at intervals of ten or twelve days with India. Steamers pass between Natal and Table Bay every week, calling at East London, Port Elizabeth, and Mossel Bay. There are also two direct lines of steamers between London and Durban, the average passage of which is about 26 days. Two mail and passenger trains leave daily for Cape Town via Johannesburg, the distance being accomplished in 72 hours.

There is direct land telegraph communication with the Transvaal, the Orange River Colony, the Cape, Rhodesia, Delagoa Bay, and other parts of South Africa; and by cable with Zanzibar, Aden, Europe, and the world generally.

The rates of postage are:

There are 1,793 miles of Government telegraphs constructed at a cost of about 214,716L., and the earnings of the Post and Telegraph Departments for the year 1904 were 199,716L. (exclusive of the value of Government messages, 37,958L.), and the expenses 194,277L.

Natal Government Railways.

Statistical Summary as at 31st December, 1904.

There are 775¾ miles of railway open, all constructed and worked by the Government, with the exception of the North Coast extension beyond Verulam to Tugela (50 miles), which was constructed by the Natal-Zululand Railway Company, and an extension of 98 miles from Tugela to Somkele (Hlabisa Coalfields), constructed by Mr. Thomas Reynolds, both of which are worked by the Government, on behalf of the constructors, in accordance with working agreements.

The main line extends from the Port of Durban to Pietermaritzburg (the capital of the Colony, 70 miles inland), and thence to Charlestown, on the border of the Transvaal (306 miles distant from the port), where it connects with the line to Johannesburg and Pretoria.

The work of railway construction was begun in January, 1876, and the sections then authorised were completed in December, 1880. Two subsequent extensions of 119 and 114 miles respectively were sanctioned, and the last, which completes the main line to Charlestown, was opened for passenger traffic on 7th April, 1891, and for goods traffic on 1st August, 1891. Connection with Johannesburg and Pretoria was opened on the 1st December, 1895.

A branch line runs from Thornville Junction (59¾ miles from the port) to Richmond (17 miles), and from Pietermaritzburg a branch connects Greytown with the City (64¾ miles).

A branch to Harrismith in the Orange River Colony, from the main line at the 190¾ milepost, was opened on the 12th July, 1892, with a mileage of 59¾ miles, 23¼ of which run through the Orange River Colony. This section of 23¼ miles between Van Reenen and Harrismith, originally constructed and still worked by the Government, is now owned by the Central South African Railway, having been purchased by the Transvaal as from the 1st December, 1903.

An extension of the line from Harrismith to Bethlehem (65 miles) is open for traffic. The section is, however, still in the hands of the Construction Department. When complete, the line will be handed over to the Natal Government, to be worked under the arrangements applicable to the Van Reenen-Harrismith section.

A branch line runs from Glencoe Junction (231¾ miles distant from the port), tapping the Dundee Coalfields, and thence to Vryheid (69¾ miles), the Capital of the territory of the late Zululand Republic, recently added to the Colony of Natal.

A branch extends northwards from Durban to Somkele (167¾ miles), in the Province of Zululand.

Another branch runs from South Coast Junction to North Shepstone (77 miles), and places in touch with the town of Durban a portion of the Colony which has large natural resources. This district contains valuable lime and marble deposits.

A line runs from the South Coast Branch at Alexandra Junction to Umtinto, 6½ miles distant, and serves an important sugar-growing area.

A further branch connecting the main line with the Bluff side (Wests) goes out from Clairmont on the South Coast Line, and is 6½ miles in extent.

Work upon the new connection with Cape Colony, which will effect its junction at Riverside on the Griqualand East boundary, a distance of 100 miles from Maritzburg (the Natal Trunk Line junction), has been commenced, and the first section of about 37½ miles is now open for traffic. A further section of 42½ miles, it is expected, will be completed towards the end of the year.

The following are other extensions in Natal now in course of construction:—North Shepstone (terminus of South Coast line) to Marburg, 10 miles; Ennersdale (154 miles Main line) to Los Kop, 13 miles.

The total cost of construction of the railways up to the end of 1904 was 11,170,487L. The receipts for 1904 were 1,933,934L., and the expenditure 1,531,210L. The net receipts were equal to 34L. 12s. 1½d. per cent. upon the capital expended on open lines.

In addition to the railways owned and worked by the Natal Government there are two private lines in Natal. The Tea Estates of Messrs. J. L. Hulett and Sons, Ltd., are served by a 2 feet narrow gauge railway which branches off from Stanger Station, and is 8 miles in length. The ruling gradient of the railway is 1 in 30.

The Lower Illovo Sugar Estate, situated on the south coast about 22 miles from Durban, possesses a 2 feet narrow gauge line 8 miles in length. The grades vary from 1 to 4·81 in 100.
Defence.

There was, in 1904, an Imperial garrison quartered at Pietermaritzburg, Howick, and Mooi River, consisting of one infantry battalion, besides detachments of the usual departmental corps. The total strength of the Imperial Forces in Natal, 1904, was 824, including details, of all ranks.

The volunteer force of the Colony has been converted into a militia, is partially paid, and is divided into a naval corps of 158 men, about 2,000 mounted riflemen, 4 field batteries of 356, and 2 infantry battalions of 778 men; total, 3,449 of all ranks (1904). The whole force is fully equipped and armed with modern weapons.

The Colony also maintains an armed and mounted police force, numbering 1,025 Europeans, fully equipped and available for field service. The volunteers and police were on active service for over 12 months during the Boer War (1899-1902). Since the beginning of 1903 volunteering received a great impetus, owing to the passing of the Militia Act; and in September of that year the total number of all ranks was about 2,700.

Military training is compulsory on all boys over 10 years attending the Government schools. They are organised in cadet corps, and numbered 2,923 at end of 1904. There is also a senior cadet corps, formed during 1904, composed of youths who have left school from 16 to 20 years of age, and numbering some 442. In addition to this, members of rifle associations are liable to be called out for defence purposes. At the end of 1904 there were 76 Rifle Associations, with a total strength, excluding Natal police and militiamen, of 2,678.

The Port of Durban is defended by batteries armed with modern heavy guns.

Industry.

The chief exports are wool, sugar, tea, hides, skins, horns, coal, maize, hair, wattle bark, fruit, ale and beer, and tobacco.

There was a large transit trade with the Orange River Colony and the Transvaal previous to the war, which, it is hoped, will be enormously increased in future years. The harbour of Durban, which has a bar at its entrance, has been much improved by the works of the Harbour Department, and by dredging. The average depth at low water, for 1904, was 25 ft. 9 in. The largest ships are now able to come in and go out at all times with perfect safety. It is a port of registry, having in 1904 23 vessels, with a total tonnage of 2,160 tons (net), in addition to a number of tugs and dredgers owned by Government. The main industry of the Colony is, however, agriculture, large numbers of cattle and sheep being reared, and large crops of maize and sugar raised. The land under cultivation amounted in 1904 to 729,712 acres.

The coal-mining industry is one that is increasing every year. The output for the last three years being:

| Year | Tons. | Value at Pit's Mouth |
|------|-------|---------------------|
| 1901 | 569,200 | £549,439 |
| 1902 | 592,821 | 512,574 |
| 1903 | 713,548 | 418,975 |
| 1904 | 858,298 | 457,000 |

The amount consumed by the railway department in 1904 was 185,404 tons. There is also a considerable and growing trade in bunkered and exported coal; coal bunkered, 383,147 tons; exported, 111,945 tons.

There were 23 out-putting collieries in 1904.

The present output is at the rate of about 900,000 tons per annum. The value of coal at the pit's mouth is about 12s. a ton, and the freight charged for railway transport is ½d. a ton per mile.

The area under sugar in 1904 was about 16,513 acres, the produce for the year 1904 being about 19,000 tons (a great portion of the sugar-cane is not crushed for sugar, but is grown for the purpose of feeding stock); that under coffee about 157 acres, yielding about 24,859 lbs. Tea, tobacco, arrowroot, wattle trees, and cayenne pepper are also grown. The area under tea in 1904 was 4,064 acres, yielding 2,406,367 lbs., and the total area cultivated by natives was 400,088 acres.

The stock owned by Europeans was as follows:

Horses, 30,099; mules, 2,875; cattle (horned), 270,671; sheep, 568,946; goats, 146,882; pigs, 18,117; donkeys, 1,498; ostriches, 509.

The stock owned by natives was as follows:

Horses, 23,957; cattle (horned), 390,090; sheep, 157,791; goats, 730,065; pigs, 34,228. Stock owned by Indians: Cattle, 4,113; goats, 14,714; horses, 494; pigs, 952; sheep, 15.

The very large decrease in the number of horned cattle is due to the ravages of rinderpest during the latter half of 1897, and, since then, to losses caused by the war, 1899-1902. The disease was stamped out, but has since reappeared in a mild form in several districts.

Currency and Banking.

The currency is exclusively British sterling. The Natal Bank, the Standard Bank of South Africa, the Bank of Africa, the African Banking Corporation, and the National Bank of South Africa have together thirty-five establishments, with 4,342,385l. deposits in 1904. A Government savings bank was established in 1868, and had in 1904 (December 31st) 560,659l. deposits.

Education.

In the year ended 30th June, 1904, there were 452 schools under Government inspection—257 European, 9 coloured, 158 native, and 28 Indian—with an aggregate attendance of 22,929. There are 41 Government schools, and 411 Government-aided Schools. The aggregate number of pupils in regular attendance at the Government and Government-aided Schools was 23,691 (1903-04).

The management is vested in the Minister of Education, with the Superintendent of Education as permanent head of the Department, and the local control occasionally in committees. Education is not compulsory. There are Government secondary schools at Pietermaritzburg and Durban, as well as private establishments. The expenditure on education, for the financial year 1903-04, amounted to 98,748l. 7s. 9d., and the revenue to 13,796l. 18s. 1d.
