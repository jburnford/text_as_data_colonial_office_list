BRITISH GUIANA.

Situation and Area.

This Colony is a portion of the South American Continent, extending from east to west about 300 miles, and from north to south about 550 miles. It includes the settlements of Demerara, Essequebo, and Berbice, and is bounded on the east by Dutch Guiana, from which it is divided by the River Corentyne, on the south by Brazil, on the west by Venezuela, and on the north and northeast by the Atlantic Ocean. Its area is about 90,000 square miles, extending from 9° to 1° north latitude, and from 57° to 61° west longitude. About 130 square miles only are under cultivation.

The western boundary was till 1899 in dispute with Venezuela. The Dutch, while British Guiana was in their possession, claimed the whole watershed of the Essequebo river, while the Venezuelans asserted that the Spanish province of Guayana extended up to the Essequebo itself. Various attempts were made to settle the question by negotiation, but without result; and in 1886 Her Majesty's Government, without prejudice to their claim to the whole territory held by their Dutch predecessors in title, declared definitely that they would not allow any advance on the part of Venezuela beyond the boundary recommended by Sir R. Schomburgk, who surveyed it in 1842-43, as a good natural boundary, well within the limits which Great Britain might have rightfully claimed. Shortly after this, in 1887, Venezuela broke off diplomatic relations with Great Britain, which were only resumed in 1897 after arbitration on the territory in dispute had been agreed upon between the British and Venezuelan Governments by a treaty dated 2nd February, 1897. The tribunal constituted by the treaty—composed of two judges of the High Court of England, two judges of the Supreme Court of the United States, with Professor de Martens as President—met at Paris on 15th June, 1899, and after hearing arguments by counsel on both sides gave their decision in favour of a line not greatly differing from the Schomburgk line, though they awarded to Venezuela Point Barima and the immediately adjacent land and the district between the Wenamu and the upper reaches of the Cuyuni.

A further claim to the southern portion of the western boundary was made by Brazil; and the Paris tribunal, while pronouncing in favour of the British claim at this part of the line, expressly reserved the rights of Brazil. This matter had been the subject of negotiation since 1843, and after renewed and partly successful attempts to settle the question completely by negotiation, the more important difference was referred to the arbitration of the King of Italy by a treaty of November, 1901. The proceedings in this case were entirely written, and were completed in February, 1904. The judgment of the King of Italy was given on 14th June, 1904, and resulted in the establishment of the British title to about half the area which His Majesty's Government claimed against Brazil. Great Britain retained everything to the east of the Mahu or Ireng and the Upper Takutu, including the Savannah country of the Macusis and Wapisianas. Brazil was awarded the country between the Mahu and Cotinga.

History and Constitution.

The territory was first partially settled between 1616 and 1621 by the Dutch West India Company, who erected a fort and depot at Fort Kykoveral in the present county of Essequebo. In 1624 a settlement was founded on the Berbice by Van Peere, a Flushing merchant, under license from the Company. The first English attempt at settlement was made by Captain Leigh on the O'apock river (now French Guiana) in 1604. The effort, though followed up by Robert Harcourt in 1613 and 1627, failed to establish a permanent settlement. Lord Willoughby, famous in the early history of Barbados, also turned his attention to Guiana, and founded a settlement in Surinam in 1663, which was captured by the Dutch in 1667, and ceded to them at the peace of Breda in exchange for New York. The Dutch retained their hold on the three colonies with more or less firmness, now yielding to England, now to France or Portugal, till 1796, when during the war of the French Revolution they were captured by a British Fleet from Barbados. The territory was restored to the Dutch in 1802, but in the following year retaken by Great Britain, and finally ceded to that Power in 1814.

Under the Dutch, Demerara and Essequebo constituted one Government, and Berbice another, an arrangement which continued in force under the British Administration down to the year 1831.

The constitution of the Colony of Berbice dates from the year 1732; under it the Governor was nominated by the Directors of the Mercantile Body called the Berbice Association, and was assisted by a council of six. In 1826 an order of the King in Council was issued, dissolving the then Council of Government, appointing another, and thenceforward vesting the right of appointing to vacancies in the Governor as representing the Crown.
The Court of Policy for Essequebo appears to have been established very early in the history of the Colony. In 1773 that for Demerara, which had existed less than 30 years, was merged in it and the seat of Government for the United provinces established at Stabroek, the site of the present capital Georgetown. Disputes having arisen between the Colonists, the local Government and the West India Company as to the right of appointing the colonial members of the Court of Policy; in the year 1788, a provisional "Plan of Redress," as it was termed (being in fact the draft of a new constitution) was framed by a Committee of the States-General, to whom had been referred sundry petitions of the Colonists. This being approved of, a commission was despatched by the States-General to the Colony, who on their arrival in 1789 dissolved the then existing Government and established a new one for the conjoined Colonies upon the basis of the scheme in question, which continued in operation notwithstanding the captures of the Colony by the British in 1796 and in 1802, and its cession in 1803, the Articles of Capitulation having stipulated that the laws, usages, and institutions of the Colony should be maintained as before.

The Council or Court of Policy consisted of 1st, The Director-General; 2, The Commander of Essequebo; 3, The Fiscal of Essequebo; 4, The Fiscal of Demerara; 5 and 6, two Colonists from Essequebo; 7 and 8, two Colonists from Demerara.

In the first instance, the unofficial portion of the Council was to be chosen from a double nomination by the Colleges of Kiezers or Electors, of which there were two, one for each County,* each consisting of seven Members elected by a majority of the votes of the inhabitants possessing not fewer than twenty-five slaves, such votes to be in writing and signed by the voter. The tenure of the Office of Kiezer, as subsequently defined by Proclamation of Sir Benjamin d'Urban in 1831, was to be for life, unless the party resigned or ceased to be an inhabitant.

In 1796 it was deemed necessary, during a period of some confusion, to introduce four members "commissioned" by the Colleges of Electors of both Colonies to have, jointly with the Court of Policy, the administration of the public funds. In the following year, however, Governor Beaujon annulled this arrangement, and to secure to the inhabitants more ample control of taxation enacted that in lieu of the four above-mentioned, there should be six inhabitants adjoined to the Governor and Court of Policy, three from each Colony, to be elected by the inhabitants qualified as in the case of Kiezers, and to serve for two years, but with powers strictly limited to raising Colony taxes, and assisting in the audit of the public accounts.

Beaujon's proclamation was materially modified, though without affecting the definition of the duties of the financial representatives, by a proclamation of Acting Governor Carmichael in 1812, consolidating the two Colleges of Kiezers and Financial Representatives. This proclamation remained operative, though unconfirmed by the Crown, until, in 1831, when the three provinces were united, it was annulled by a Royal Instruction restoring the pre-existing arrangement, and extending the right of suffrage to the inhabitants of Berbice.

With an exception in regard to the franchise, to be noticed hereafter, this has been the usage and procedure till now, from which the inference has been drawn that the Financial Representatives had, and have, no authority whatever, except by express permission from the Crown, to discuss any item upon the estimate so as to alter its amount, although they might refuse to include any sum to which they objected in their calculations of the funds necessary to be raised by taxation.*

The colonial members have never acquiesced in this interpretation of the constitution, and there have been frequent collisions between the Executive and Elective sections of the Court.† The position they assume is based upon the construction of a passage in a decree of the States-General, dated 27th August, 1788, to the effect that "the contributions for the Colonial Chest are to be regulated by the inhabitants themselves"; and a passage in the instructions issued to Director-General Van Grovestein in 1793, "He will take care not to leave the administration of the Colony Chest wholly to the Colony Members of the Court of Policy, but will thereto admit a great number of the Colonists, for example the 'Kiezers of both rivers.'" The nature of certain entries in the Minutes from 1798 to 1806 has also been held to support this contention.

In the year 1855 under the administration of Sir Philip Wodehouse, an Ordinance was passed to alter and amend the Political Institutions of the Colony, but it was not approved by Her Majesty; and from that date till 1891 the only constitutional legislation was the passing of Ordinance No. 1 of 1864, a declaratory Act, defining the meaning of the term "Colonist," as employed in the "Plan of Redress" above noticed; and Ordinance No. 16 of 1864, to remove some difficulties in the exercise of the functions of the College of Electors.

The Constitution, as it existed up to 1891, may be summed up very briefly. It consisted of a Governor, Court of Policy, and a Combined Court. The functions of an Executive and Legislative Council and House of Assembly were performed by the Governor and Court of Policy, except as regards taxation and finance, which were and still are dealt with by the Combined Court, composed of the Governor and Members of the Court of Policy, combined with the six Financial Representatives. The Court of Policy passes all laws and ordinances, except the Annual Tax Ordinance, which is passed by the Combined Court.

During 1891 an Act was passed, which came into force in 1892, effecting a considerable change in the constitution. By this Act the administrative functions of the Court of Policy have been transferred to an executive council, and the duties of the former become purely legislative.

The Combined Court has the power of (1) imposing the Colonial taxes and auditing the public accounts; and (2) discussing freely and without reserve the items on the annual estimates prepared by the Governor, in Executive Council. The first of these powers is the birthright of the Combined Court, having been bestowed in 1796, when Governor Beaujon called the financial representatives into being, "with a right of voting only for the raising of colonial taxes and not further"; while the second is conferred periodically by His Majesty's Order in Council after each renewal of the Civil List and is co-existent with the Civil

* During the discussions on the Civil List in 1848-9, it was suggested by some of the Elective Section to adopt this course, leaving upon the Governor the responsibility of paying the difference between the sums fixed and the amount provided.

† Proceedings relative to the Functions of the Financial representative, 1832.
List. The Civil List has recently been renewed for three years from the 1st January, 1905.

The Court of Policy, under the new constitution, consists of the Governor, seven official members, and eight elected members. It may be prorogued or dissolved at any time by the Governor and in any case is dissolved at the end of five years, and a general election must be held within two months of the date of dissolution. The number of financial representatives, who with the Court of Policy form the Combined Court, remains unchanged (6).

The qualification for membership of the Court of Policy, which hitherto was restricted to ownership of 80 acres of land, 40 of which had to be under cultivation, is extended to ownership of immovable property of the value of not less than £1,562.10s., or ownership or possession under a lease for 21 years or upwards, of a house, or house and land, of the annual rental value of £250.

The qualification for election as a financial representative is the same as for membership of the Court of Policy, with the further qualification of clear annual income of £300, arising from any kind of property not mentioned in any other property qualification, or from any profession, business, or trade carried on in the colony.

The College of Electors, which elected members of the Court of Policy, has been abolished, and members are now elected by the direct vote of the people.

The franchise in the case of county voters is extended to every person who during the six months previous to registration has had—

(1.) Ownership of not less than three acres of land actually under cultivation; or of a house, or a house and land, of the annual rental or value of not less than £20.; or (2.) occupation or tenancy of not less than six acres of land under cultivation; or of a house, or of a house and land, of the annual rental or value of not less than £40.; or

(3.) An annual income or salary of not less than £100., coupled with residence in the district or division; or

(4.) Has paid during the twelve months previous to registration direct taxes to the Colonial revenue of £4. 3s. 4d. or upwards, coupled with residence in the district or division during the six months previous to registration.

In the case of city voters the franchise extends to every person who has had during the six months previous to registration—

(1.) Ownership of a house, or of a house and premises, to the value of not less than £104. 3s. 4d.; or

(2.) Occupation or tenancy, of a house, or of a house and premises, of the annual rental or value of not less than £25.; or

(3.) An annual income or salary of not less than £100., coupled with residence in the district; or

(4.) Has paid during the twelve months previous to registration, direct taxes to the colonial revenue of £4. 3s. 4d. or upwards, coupled with residence in the district during the six months previous to registration.

Aliens who previously acquired the political rights of citizenship after three years' residence, are now debarred from such rights while they remain aliens.

The number of registered electors in December, 1904, was 3,067.

There is a Public Officers' Guarantee Fund, and also a Widows' and Orphans' Fund, towards the latter of which all officers with salaries over £100. contribute 4 or 5 per cent. of their salaries.

On the 21st December, 1900, the latter fund was closed to officers appointed thereafter, who are now subject to a scheme of compulsory insurance.

Pensions are granted to public officers under Ordinance No. 11 of 1903, after reaching the age of 55 years, or on medical certificate of physical or mental incapacity, provided the officer has served 10 years.

An officer transferred from another Colony is not entitled to pension unless he has served at least five years in British Guiana.

Pensions are calculated at the rate of $\frac{1}{10}$th of the officer's average emoluments for five years preceding his retirement, the maximum allowed being £500. Special pensions are granted to the Judges.

Officers who joined the Service prior to 1897 enjoy more liberal pensions under Act No. 3 of 1875, which has been repealed by No. 11 of 1903.

Local Government.

In 1837 the first municipal body was incorporated, but the principle has not been materially extended in its application.

The existing municipal authorities are: mayor and town council, Georgetown; and mayor and town council, New Amsterdam. Their revenue in 1904-05 was respectively £53,081.1s.—£12,240., and their expenditure £49,116.1s.—£12,115. There are also 19 villages incorporated, whose revenue and expenditure in 1904-05 were respectively £8,221. and £7,880. The total village debt was £3,193.

The Roman-Dutch law is in force in civil cases, modified by Orders in Council and local Ordinances; the Criminal Law is now based on that of Great Britain, and is administered in the same manner, except that there is no Grand Jury.

Internal Communications.

The three rivers, Demerara, Essequebo, and Berbice, are navigable for 90, 35, and 150 miles respectively. Beyond these distances, owing to the nature of the country, they abound in cataracts and waterfalls. There is a good network of roads, and there are small canals in connection with the Demerara River. There is a railway from Georgetown to Rosignol, Berbice—60½ miles in length, owned by the Demerara Railway Company, Limited. Its receipts for the year ended 31st December, 1904, were £45,284., its expenses £43,573. The line was constructed at a total cost of £69,313. A railway, 18½ miles in length, connecting the Upper Demerara and Upper Essequebo rivers leading to the interior, and affording access to the gold diggings, in connection with which a daily service of steam launches plies on the Demerara and Essequebo rivers, has been open since the beginning of 1897, whilst the Demerara Railway Company have constructed a line on the West Coast connecting Vreedenhooi with Greenwich Park, about 15 miles in length. The Government pays a subsidy to the Company to make up with the net earnings a sum equal to interest at 4 per cent. on £1,500,000, or £312,500. The postal telegraph system comprises about 539½ miles of line, with 11 cables, covering a distance of 26 miles. It is in connection with a cable to Trinidad, and thus with the other West Indian Islands, Canada, Europe and the United States. The revenue from the postal telegraph and telephone services in 1904-05 was £4,270., and the expenditure for maintenance £4,587. A telephone exchange (350 subscribers) is established at Georgetown and at New Amsterdam in connection
with the postal telegraph; length of telephone line 1,220½ miles, longest line 15 miles. Local steamers run under contract from Georgetown to New Amsterdam, to the Essequibo coast, to Bartica, and to Mount Everard on the Barima River, 46 miles from its mouth. Steamers also ply up the Berbice and Demerara Rivers. Launches of light draught can, during a portion of the year, proceed up the Barima River to Arakaka, the centre of the mining industry in the North-Western District.

Roads have been also opened by the Government between the Barima and Barana rivers, between the Potaro and Conawaruk rivers, from Kalacoon towards the Caburi creek between the Essequibo and Massaruni; and a road is at present being constructed by private enterprise between Cartabo point on the Massaruni River to the Puruni River.

A well-organised postal service extends throughout the colony, letters reaching Pomeroon in 24 hours from Georgetown, and the North-Western District in 36 hours. Georgetown and New Amsterdam are lighted by electricity; and in the former there is an efficient electric tram service on the overhead trolley system.

**Education.**

A State-aided system of elementary education was established by Law No. 3 of 1876.

The schools are denominational, except the Estates schools. The central administration is vested in the Inspector of Schools, and the local control conducted by managers, who are usually ministers of religion.

The number of schools receiving aid in 1904–05 was 213, with 29,093 scholars, and the aid granted amounted to 23,445£. 19s.

Provision is made for higher education by a Government college in Georgetown, in which the course of instruction is similar to that of a public school or first grade grammar school in England, and there is awarded annually one public scholarship of the value of 200£ per annum, tenable at a University in England for three years. Scholarships, entitling the holders to free education at the Government College or at other approved schools, are granted to scholars of the Primary Schools.

**Currency and Banking.**

Accounts are kept in dollars and cents. British sterling and United States gold coin is current and legal tender, as well as Spanish and Mexican gold. Spanish, Mexican, or Colombian dollars are no longer legal tender, under Ordinance No. 1 of 1876.

The "Colonial" and "British Guiana" Banks have establishments at Georgetown, with branches at New Amsterdam. The British Guiana Bank on the 31st March, 1904, had a note circulation of 46,301£. 0s. 10d., and the Colonial Bank 64,742£. 10s. The total note circulation in the Colony is about 111,000£.

The first Government savings banks were established at Georgetown and New Amsterdam in the year 1836. The total deposits amounted on 31st December, 1904, to 240,600£., among 14,050 depositors. There are 27 Post Office Savings Banks. At the end of 1904 these banks had 9,138 depositors, with 54,864£. to their credit.

**Industry and Productions.**

The staple products of British Guiana were in former years sugar, rum, molasses, cotton, and coffee. The soil of some parts of the Colony is capable of producing coffee of rare excellence, the Berbice River coffee being once much prized. The latter two industries have now given place to the cultivation of the sugar-cane, which at present is the chief industry of the Colony, and furnishes seventy-two per cent. in value of its exports. Timber, charcoal, and ballata, a species of gum, are also exported. There are forty-five sugar estates in active operation, with a total area of 156,416 acres, of which 70,880 are under sugar, 1,580 under plantains and other cultivation, and the remainder uncultivated.

The forests, with which the interior of the colony is covered, abound in woods of rare beauty and value. Some of the hard woods are, from their remarkable durability, peculiarly suitable for house and shipbuilding purposes, while others are equally prized for the manufacture of household furniture.

During 1904–05, 106,716 tons of sugar, 2,671,581 Pf. gallons of rum, 423,154 gallons molasses and 8,967 tons molascuit or cattle foods were exported. The bulk of the production is the high-class sugar known as Demerara crystals.

Further attention is being given to the planting of coffee and cocoa on the vegetable soils on the banks of the rivers.* Rice is now grown to a considerable extent on the Coolie Settlements and by Free Coolies on the low lands within the empoldered areas, 20,000 acres being now under cultivation. The development of the minor industries is receiving considerable attention.

Gold and diamond working is carried on by about 13,000 diggers; 94,617 ozs. were exported in 1904–05, valued at 322,125£. The royalty received amounted to 13,980£. The diamonds exported during 1904–05, 10,478 carats, valued at 16,395£.

The values of the principal exports besides sugar and gold are:—Timber, 24,435£.; gums, 38,347£., including ballata; charcoal, 8,369£.; firewood, 3,172£.; shingles, 2,144£.; cocoa, 2,635£.; cattle, 3,991£.; hides, 1,606£.; and fish glue, 1,148£.

The chief imports are rice, beef, pork, cornmeal, flour, machinery, dried fish, and manure.

Nearly half the trade is with the United Kingdom, and a third with the United States; the other important countries being India, Canada, and the West Indies.

**Climate.**

The climate is hot, but not unhealthy. The mean temperature throughout the year is about 82° Fahr., the mean maximum being 88° in the month of September, and the mean minimum 74° in the month of January. The heat, which is greatly tempered by cooling breezes from the sea prevailing during the greater portion of the year, is felt more from July to October than at other times, owing to the partial cessation of these breezes. There are annually two wet seasons, from June to the end of August and during December, January and February. The annual rainfall for the past 10 years averages about 94 inches in Georgetown. The rainfall in 1904–05 was 85.75 inches.

**Towns.**

The capital is Georgetown, situated in lat. 6° 49' 24" N., and long. 58° 11' 30" W., and possessing a population of 53,176 in 1891. New Amsterdam

* The cocoa estates are chiefly on Canal No. 1, West Bank of the Demerara River, and cocoa is grown on a small scale on some sugar estates adjacent to the cane cultivation. Coffee was grown principally in the country of Berbice, and the Liberian coffee bean was in past years planted with great success also on some estates near Canal No. 1. Its production has fallen to below the local demands.
had a population of 8,903 in 1891. Both these are ports of registry, having on 31st December, 1904, 56 vessels, of a total tonnage of 3,112.

Means of Communication.

The regular mail communication with the Colony is maintained by the vessels of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, which leave Southampton every alternate Saturday, those of the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, from France and the West Indies, and the Dutch line from Holland and Havre, both monthly. There is also the line of steamers of the Pickford and Black Steamship Co. (Halifax, Bermuda, West Indies, and Demerara) running fortnightly; as well as other lines trading to the Colony which carry mails, but the periods of departure of the latter are uncertain. The length of the voyage between Georgetown and England is 13½ days.
