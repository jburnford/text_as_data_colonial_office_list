CYPRUS.

Situation and Topography.

The Island of Cyprus is situated in the easternmost basin of the Mediterranean Sea, with Asia Minor to the north and Syria to the east, at distances of 60 and 41 miles respectively. It lies between 34° 33' and 35° 41' N. latitude, and between 32° 20' and 34° 35' E. longitude. The port of Larnaca on the southern coast is 258 miles from Port Said, and 1,117 miles from Valletta in Malta.

It has been now systematically surveyed, and its area is 3,584 square miles, equal to Kent, Sussex, and Middlesex combined. It is the third largest island in the Mediterranean, being only exceeded in size by Sicily and Sardinia. Its greatest length from west-south-west to east-north-east, between Cape Drepano and Cape St. Andrea, is about 140 miles, and its greatest breadth from north to south is about 60 miles.

The main topographical features of the island are the northern and southern mountain chains, and the great plain of the Mesaoria extending between them across the island from the Bay of Morphou to that of Famagusta. The northern range, called the Carpas Mountains, and, towards their western extremity, the Kyrenia Mountains, forms a continuous chain near the northern shore from Cape St. Andrea to Cape Kormakiti, a distance of about 100 miles. The southern range, which is the more extensive and lofty of the two, occupies the western and south-western portions of the island, and trending thence eastwards along the south coast, terminates in the isolated peak called Santa Croce, about 12 miles west of Larnaca. The highest summit of this range is Mount Troodos, 6,406 feet above the sea level, and on its south-eastern slopes are the summer quarters of the English troops, and of the High Commissioner who administers the Government.

The rivers of Cyprus are nearly all mountain torrents, dry in summer. None are navigable. The principal are the Pedias and the Idalia.

History.

Cyprus was colonised by Phoenicians, Egyptians, and Greeks. Its ancient history is too long and eventful to be here related even in outline. When the Roman Empire was divided into east and west, Cyprus fell into the Eastern Empire, and was governed by lieutenants of the Byzantine Emperors until 1191, when Richard I. of England occupied the island to chastise the ruler, Isaac Comnenus, for the ill-treatment of the English fleet. Richard sold the island in 1192 to the Templars, but as they could not govern it, the king made it over to Guy de Lusignan, who claimed to be King of Jerusalem, and undertook the obligations of the Templars. The island was ruled by the Lusignan family from 1192 until 1489, when Queen Catarina Cornaro, herself a Venetian and widow of James II., having survived her husband and his posthumous son, James III., yielded the government of the island to the Republic of Venice. Venice ruled the island until 1570-71, when the Ottoman Turks invaded it, and captured and put to the sword the Venetian garrisons.

The island remained under the government of the Sultans of Constantinople from 1571 until 1878, with the exception of the period from 1832 to 1840, when it was held by the Pasha of Egypt, then at war with the Porte. It may be observed that the island was frequently invaded by the Arabs, Saracens, and Egyptians before its final conquest by the Turks, and that from 1425 to 1571 it paid tribute to Egypt. The great fortress and port of Famagusta was held by the Genoese Republic from 1373 until 1464, when the Lusignan king, James II., retook it with the help of the Egyptians.

Climate.

The mean temperature for the last ten years is 66° 3° Fahr.; mean maximum, 78°; mean minimum, 57°. Highest shade temperature during that time 113°; lowest 19°. Average rainfall for last ten years, 15-35 inches. The rainy and cool season is from October to March. The climate is varied, hot and dry in the plains in summer, and damp on the sea-shore; the climate on the hills inland is bracing and healthy. In winter the temperature rarely falls below freezing point. The year 1904 had a rainfall of 20-02 inches, somewhat in excess of the average. The island may be said to be, in every way, healthy. Malarial fever used to be, to a certain extent, prevalent. Sanitary improvements and plantations of trees have, however, had a beneficial effect, and true malarial fever is now infrequent.

Population.

The population of the several districts, excluding the military, at the census taken in 1881, 1891, and 1901, was:

| District   | 1901    | 1891    | 1881    |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Nicosia    | 71,289  | 61,695  | 56,300  |
| Famagusta  | 48,508  | 41,423  | 38,207  |
| Larnaca    | 26,073  | 23,760  | 20,766  |
| Limassol   | 39,139  | 35,730  | 28,717  |
| Papho      | 35,205  | 31,674  | 28,424  |
| Kyrenia    | 16,808  | 15,004  | 13,216  |

Total       | 237,022 | 209,286 | 185,630 |

This shows an increase during the decade of 27,736, or an increase on the 1891 census of 13·25 per cent.

The Moslems form about 21½ per cent. of the population, the rest being nearly all Christians of the Orthodox Greek Church.

Towns.

The chief towns are Nicosia, the capital, 14,752 (12,515 in 1891) inhabitants; Larnaca, 7,964 (7,593 in 1891); Limassol, 8,298 (7,388 in 1891). The two latter are open roadsteads. At Famagusta, on the east, it has often been proposed to construct a great commercial and naval harbour. The inner harbour is now being dredged over an area of 900 feet by 600 feet, to 24 feet at low water (ordinary spring tides), with a channel of approach 250 feet wide and 26 feet deep. The curtain wall, south of Othello's Tower, has been pierced with three arches, giving access from the town to the new quay. The quay is faced with a concrete wall 900 feet long in 24 feet of water. Further accommodation for sailing vessels and local craft is being provided in a basin 450 feet long, 200 feet wide, and 15 feet deep at low water. At present the town is little more than a collection of ruins encircled by fortifications, and it has only 818 (763 in 1891) inhabitants, nearly all Molems. Varosia, a suburb of Famagusta, has a population of 2,948 (2,488 in 1891), nearly all Christians. The four towns already mentioned are the capitals of four of the six administrative...
provinces into which the island is divided—the other two capitals being Ktima, 2,845 inhabitants (2,562 in 1891), the modern capital of Papho, on the south-west, and Kyrenia, 1,336 inhabitants (1,322 in 1891), where a small harbour has been constructed, in the district of the same name on the north coast, which has some trade with the opposite coast of Karamania.

Industry.

Cyprus was in ancient times famous for its mines, but with the exception of a concession granted in 1886, and since abandoned, they have not been worked in recent times. A company is now, however, prospecting for copper at Lymni. Gypsum is exported in a raw state from the Carpas, mostly to Syria, and manufactured—i.e., in the form of plaster-of-paris—from Larnaca and Limassol, where machinery has been set up for grinding it; from these ports it is mostly sent to Egypt. The main industry of the island is agriculture, the products chiefly consisting of cereals, carobs, wine and spirits, cotton, linseed, aniseed, silk, cheese, wool, fruit, and vegetables; cattle, mules, donkeys, sheep, and poultry are also exported.

Agriculture has been greatly retarded by want of water, the rainfall being deficient, and much of what does fall being allowed to run to waste. A scheme for storing water for irrigation has been carried out under the superintendence of an engineer lent by the Government of India, and is now under the direction of the Director of Public Works.

The carobs and cereals are exported mainly to the United Kingdom, France, and Egypt.

Cyprus wine is somewhat heavy for ordinary use, and its value in commerce has been lessened by the tarry flavour it acquires from the practice of carrying it to port in tarred skins. This practice has for some time been discouraged as much as possible, and the construction of roads through the grape districts enables the wine to be conveyed in barrels. Improved methods of manufacture are being brought into use.

Both wine and spirits have, since the extra duty was imposed in France, found a fairly good demand in Egypt and in other parts of the Turkish Empire.

From the year 1883, when direct and regular communication with Egypt terminated, the production of fruit and vegetables, for which the island is well adapted, ceased to develop, but now that direct and regular communication has again been secured considerable progress in this industry has taken place. The direct communication with Egypt has also given a great impetus to the export of the surplus oxen, sheep, and other animals. For the Uganda railway some 1,300 mules were exported and stud donkeys have been exported at regular intervals for the Government of India.

In past years much injury was done to the crops by locusts, but the work of locust destruction was vigorously prosecuted for many years with great success, chiefly on what is known as the "screen and pit" system. Screens topped with American cloth, over which the locusts cannot pass, were stretched across the country in front of the armies of young locusts on the march. The locusts were then gradually forced into pits dug at intervals transversely to the screens, from which, as they are topped with a zinc lining, they could not emerge. This system, as the locusts became more scattered, was discarded in favour of a system of collecting locust eggs and purchasing live locusts. The purchase system only is now in force.

The forests of the island, which had been largely destroyed in the past, are recovering under the protection now afforded. Natural re-afforestation is very slow, partly in consequence of the large number of goats, of which Cyprus, in proportion to its area, contains a large number, and partly in consequence of the forest fires that occur through the summer months.

Sponge fishing has been extensively carried on along the coast by boats from the Greek islands. By a law passed in 1890 power was given to the High Commissioner to grant exclusive privileges for fishing the coasts for sponges. The Agricultural Board have recently been granted a license for 10 years under the law, and no boats are allowed to fish for sponge without permission from the Agricultural Board.

Sea fishing is comparatively neglected, and it is difficult to obtain fish all the year round except at the seaport towns.

The chief imports are cotton and woollen goods, tobacco, groceries, rice, leather, petroleum, timber, sugar, soap, copper and iron; the exports are chiefly cereals, cotton, carobs, linseed, aniseed, silk, raisins, fruit and vegetables, cheese, sumac, wool, wines and spirits, vinegar, flax, sesame, gypsum, and terra umbra.

The improvement of agriculture is fostered by the Government by means of the introduction of improved machines and implements. A few harvesting machines and iron oil presses are now working successfully, and a special iron plough, constructed in England, is used by several farmers. The planting of mulberry, olive, carob and other fruit trees is increasing rapidly.

Currency and Banking.

Under an Order in Council, which came into operation on the 1st January, 1901, the following coins are legal tender currency:—Gold, the sovereign. Silver, 18, 9, 4½, 3 piastre pieces, limit of tender 540 piastres (nine equal to one shilling). Bronze, 1 piastre, half piastre, quarter piastre, limit of tender, 27 piastres (40 paras = 1 piastre).

The Imperial Ottoman Bank has a branch established at Larnaca, and agencies at Nicosia and Limassol.

A Government savings bank was opened on 1st January, 1903.

The Turkish weights and measures are in use. The oke=2·8lbs. avoirdupois; and the donum=about ¼ acre. A law relating to weights and measures was passed in 1890.

Means of Communication.

The Government Railway from Famagusta to Nicosia came into use in August, 1903, and its extension to Karavastasi is in progress.

There is no navigable waterway in the island. Roads between all important places are maintained, and many villages are now connected with them by cart roads. The Famagusta harbour is almost completed. There are no Government telegraphs, but the Eastern Telegraph Company Limited, maintain a cable from Egypt to Cyprus and land lines connecting the six principal towns of the Island and the Troodos Government Quarter. The Imperial Ottoman Telegraph Administration has also a cable to the coast of Asia Minor, but it has not been in working order for some time.
A weekly Mail Service has been established between Egypt and Cyprus by subsidised steamer of Bell's Asia Minor SS. Co., which connects with the outward and homeward mails between England and Port Said.

There is a fortnightly mail service with Beyrouth, Caramania, Smyrna, and Constantinople by the "Messageries Maritimes" and Austrian steamers. There are also direct steamers to and from Egypt and the adjacent coast of Syria at irregular periods.

The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters per ½ oz. Newspapers per 2 oz. |
|----------------------------------------|
| Within the island                      | ½ c. p. |
| To U.K., India, and certain Colonies   | 30 pars |
| To other countries                     | 2 c. p. |

The Parcels Post is established between Cyprus and the United Kingdom and the principal colonies and foreign countries, as well as within the island.

**Education.**

A general system of grants in aid of elementary schools was established in 1882.

In accordance with a law passed in 1895, Boards of Education have been established, one to regulate the Moslem schools and another to regulate the Christian schools. There is also in each district a District Committee for Moslem schools, and a District Committee for Greek-Christian schools, presided over in each case by the Commissioner of the District. The Education Law was further consolidated and extended in 1906.

During the school year 1904-1905 there were 289 elementary schools in connection with the Greek Orthodox Church, enrolment 19,000, which receive aid amounting to 3,003l., and 118 Moslem elementary schools, enrolment 3,900, which receive aid amounting to 790l.

An Armenian boys' school and an Armenian girls' school in Nicosia, a school at the Armenian Monastery near Kythrea, and 3 Maronite schools are also aided by Government.

An Idadi or Moslem high school with 110 pupils is maintained entirely by the Government at a cost of about 500l. a year; and a grant of 200l. a year is given to the Greek gymnasium at Nicosia, with 258 pupils, which provides the required training for teachers of Greek-Christian elementary schools.

There are also Greek high schools at Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta, and Paphos, with about 250 pupils, and one endowed elementary Greek school, which are not aided by Government.

13 elementary Moslem schools are maintained entirely by a grant from Constantinople, which amounts to 240l. a year.

36 Christian and 28 Moslem elementary schools are maintained by local contributions only, without any aid from Government.

The total number of schools of all classes is 496 (162 Moslem, 334 Christian), and the total enrolment is about 25,100: 4,660 Moslems and 20,440 Christians.

**Leprosy.**

Prior to the British occupation, limited provision was made for lepers in the leper asylum or farm near Nicosia, which was originally founded by the dragoman to the Turkish governor early in the century.

The asylum has been greatly improved, yearly new houses of an improved class are erected; the old premises have been pulled down and the woodwork burnt. The welfare of the inmates has been a matter of considerable attention, and a recreation room was provided by the liberality of a former High Commissioner, Sir H. E. Bulwer, which has greatly enhanced the comfort of these poor people.

A church and mosque have also been erected by voluntary subscriptions.

There is now accommodation for over 100 inmates, and the enclosed farm of 200 donums is partly cultivated by the lepers, the produce being all used on the farm. Each person receives bread, clothing and fuel, and a government allowance of 2½ copper piastres daily.

No leper quits the farm except on very rare occasions, and then only on urgent business and with the permission of the Chief Medical Officer.

The total number of lepers in the island, as returned by the census of 1901, was 135—85 males and 50 females. On 31st March, 1905, there were 106 inmates on the leper farm.

**British Occupation.**

On the 4th June, 1878, a Convention was signed at Constantinople between the representatives of Her Britannic Majesty and the Sultan of Turkey, by which England engaged to join the Sultan in defending his Asiatic possessions against Russia in certain contingencies, and the Sultan, "in order to enable England to make necessary provision for executing her engagements," consented "to assign the Island of Cyprus, to be occupied and administered by England." On the 1st of July an Annex to this Convention was signed at Constantinople, in explanation of the conditions of the occupation. The following is the English official version of its provisions:

"I. That a Mussulman religious Tribunal (Mahkemé-i-Shéréh) shall continue to exist in the island, which will take exclusive cognisance of religious matters, and of no others, concerning the Mussulman population of the island.

"II. That a Mussulman resident in the island shall be named by the Board of Pious Foundations in Turkey (Evkaf) to superintend, in conjunction with a Delegate to be appointed by the British Authorities, the administration of the property, funds, and lands belonging to mosques, cemeteries, Mussulman schools, and other religious establishments existing in Cyprus.

"III. That England will pay to the Porte whatever is the present excess of revenue over expenditure in the island; this excess to be calculated upon and determined by the average of the last five years, stated to be 22,936 purses, to be duly verified hereafter, and to the exclusion of the produce of State and Crown lands * let or sold during that period.

"IV. That the Sublime Porte may freely sell and lease lands and other property in Cyprus belonging to the Ottoman Crown and State (Arazi

*Postage on letters to the U.K., India, and such other colonies and countries as joined the penny post arrangement was reduced to 30 parsas per ½ oz. from the 25th of Dec. 1898. A reduced rate of parcel postage to the U.K. came into effect on the 1st Jan., 1899. (See end of Introduction.)
Miriye vé Emlaki Houmayoun), the produce of which does not form part of the revenue of the island referred to in Article III.

"V. That the English Government, through their competent authorities, may purchase compulsorily, at a fair price, land required for public improvements, or for other public purposes, and land which is not cultivated.

"VI. That if Russia restores to Turkey Kars and the other conquests made by her in Armenia during the last war, the Island of Cyprus will be evacuated by England, and the Convention of the 4th of June, 1878, will be at an end."

On the 14th of August, 1878, a supplementary agreement was signed, giving to Her Britannic Majesty for the term of the occupation full powers for making laws and conventions for the government of the island in Her Majesty's name, and for the regulation of its commercial and consular relations and affairs, free from the Porte's control.

Government.

On the 14th September, 1878, an Order in Council was issued for the regulation of the government of the island. The administration was placed in the hands of an officer styled High Commissioner; a Legislative and an Executive Council were established, and the High Commissioner was invested with the powers usually conferred upon a Colonial Governor. So much of this Order in Council as relates to legislation has been superseded by another, dated the 30th Nov., 1882, under which the Legislature consists of the High Commissioner, who is usually to preside, six non-elective Members, being office-holders, and twelve elected Members, three to be chosen by the Mahometan and nine by the non-Mahometan inhabitants of the Island. British subjects and foreigners who have resided five years in Cyprus can exercise the franchise, and are eligible for election as well as Ottoman subjects. The qualification for the franchise consists in the payment of any class of the taxes called Verghi. The Council may be dissolved by the High Commissioner whenever he sees fit, and must be dissolved at the end of five years. The island, for legal and administrative purposes, is divided into six districts—namely—Nicosia, Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta, Kyrenia, and Papho. In each the Government is represented by a Commissioner.

The courts which were in existence at the time of the occupation have been superceded by a new set of courts constituted by an Order in Council, dated the 30th November, 1882, which provides for:

(1) A supreme court of criminal and civil appeal consisting at present of two judges.

(2) Six assize courts, having unlimited criminal jurisdiction, and consisting of one or more judges of the supreme court, sitting with one or more judges of the district courts.

(3) Six district courts, having criminal jurisdiction up to three years imprisonment, and unlimited civil jurisdiction; and consisting of a President and two ordinary Members, one a Christian and the other a Moslem.

(4) Six Magistrates' courts, consisting of the President of the district court or the two ordinary Members, having summary jurisdiction up to one month's imprisonment and a fine of 5l.

(5) Village courts, at present ten in number, in addition to the judges of the district courts, and having jurisdiction in cases of commonage, disputes as to the partition of property, and debt, &c., up to 5l.

Actions in the courts are divided into "Ottoman" and "Foreign" actions, according to the nationality of the defendant or defendants, and in "Foreign" actions the President of the Court alone generally exercises jurisdiction; as also in criminal cases against non-Ottomans.

The Mahkemé-Shéréh, or Musulman religious courts, are presided over by Cadi's, but their duties are strictly confined to jurisdiction in religious cases affecting the Mahometan population, as contemplated by the Anglo-Turkish Convention.

The principal sources of revenue in Cyprus are:

1. Verghi Taxes—consisting of—

   (1) A tax of 4 per 1,000 on the capital value of lands or houses.
   (2) A tax of 4 per cent. on the annual rent of land or houses let.
   (3) A tax of 3 per cent. on trade profits and incomes (excluding salaries).

2. Military exemption tax of 2s. 6d. a head on males between 18 and 60 years of age.

3. Tithes of the following products of the Island:

   Cereals—taken in kind.

   Tithe-Dues are taken on exportation of:—carouba, cotton, linseed, aniseed, raisins, wound silk, black seed ("Mavro Koko"), silk cocoons, and manufactured silk, if manufactured by other than hand looms.

   [The tithes of all other articles have been abolished, many in 1882, sixteen in 1897, and that on olives and olive oil in 1899.]

4. Sheep, goat, and pig tax.

5. An excise on spirits and tobacco.

6. Stamps, court fees, royalties, licences, &c., &c.

7. Salt monopoly.

8. Locust tax (for locust destruction).

9. Import duties.

All exemptions formerly enjoyed by foreigners have been abolished, except that from the military exemption tax. The military exemption tax itself is now payable by Moslems and Christians alike.

There is a police force of about 770 men, when at full strength, mostly Moslems.

Archaeology.

Cyprus is remarkable for its mediæval architectural remains, and the vast quantity of antiquities in the shape of coins, inscriptions, ornaments, statues, and pottery, of very ancient date, which have been discovered. A famous collection of Cypriot antiquities, that of General di Cesnola, the late United States Consul, is in the Metropolitan Museum at New York.
