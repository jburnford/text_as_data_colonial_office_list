THE FEDERATED STATES OF THE MALAY PENINSULA.

Relations with Straits Settlements.

The more intimate connection of the Straits Settlements with the Native States of the Malay Peninsula dates from the year 1874, though for many years previous relations of a semi-commercial, semi-political character had existed, as in the case of the commercial treaty between the Penang Government and Perak in 1818.

For some years prior to 1874 the anarchy prevailing in some States in the Malay Peninsula, and especially in Perak, was a source of disquiet to the Straits Settlements community, and a hindrance to the prosperity of British traders.

In the beginning of that year matters were brought to a crisis in Perak, and, with the approval of the Secretary of State, steps were taken by Sir Andrew Clarke to remedy the state of things by the Pangkor Treaty (20th January, 1874). Later on in the year British Residents were stationed in the States of Perak, Selangor, and Sungei Ujong, to advise their rulers respecting the collection of revenue and general administration.

The events leading to the establishment of the Protected State, known as the Negri Sembilan (Nine States), began in 1883, when closer relations were entered into with the State of Rembau; a federation was formed in 1889, by Sir C. C. Smith, and the officer, styled Superintendent from the time of his appointment in 1886, was created British Resident.

In 1895 this office was combined with that of the Resident of Sungei Ujong, who since 1885 had exercised control also over the administration of the adjacent inland State of Jelebu, and, in August of that year, an agreement was signed by the chiefs, by which the present Federal State (which retains the old title) was constituted.

In 1887 Sir F. Weld made an agreement with the Raja of Pahang, in accordance with which the control of his foreign relations, &c., was surrendered to the British Government. This was followed by a further agreement in 1888, between the Raja (now styled Sultan) and Governor Sir C. C. Smith, under which Pahang was taken under British protection, on the same terms as the Protected Native States on the west coast of the Peninsula; a British Resident being appointed, at the request of the Sultan, in September of that year.

The Residents of these four States are assisted by a staff of European officers, whose duty it is to carry out the executive functions. The supreme authority in each State is vested in the State Council, consisting of the highest native chiefs presided over by the Sultan or Ruler of the State, who is assisted by the Resident, and, in Perak and Selangor, the Secretary to the Resident. In the three older States there are also Chinese and non-official European representatives.

The British Residents are appointed by the Secretary of State, and are subordinate to the Resident-General and to the High Commissioner for the Federated Malay States, who is also the Governor of the Straits Settlements. The administration of each State is carried on, as far as may be, on the model of a Crown Colony.

In addition to the above States, the State and Territory of Johor, with which a treaty had been made as early as the year 1855, and other treaties subsequently, entered into closer relations with the Colony in 1885, when the Sultan, by Agreement of 11th December, 1885 (C.4627), placed his foreign
relations in the hands of the British Government, and agreed to receive a British Agent, who, however, has not yet been appointed.

In 1895 a treaty was signed by the rulers of the four States other than Johor, by which they agreed to constitute their countries a Federation (to be known as the Federated Malay States), to be administered under the advice of the British Government. While all existing treaties and arrangements stand, the States agree to the appointment of an officer, to be styled Resident-General of the Malay States, to control the Residents appointed to each State, and to be the means of communication between the State Governments and the High Commissioner. Subject to the authority created by the appointment of the Resident-General, the system of administration under the advice of British Residents remains unchanged.

The States undertake to give each other material assistance in men and money, the wealthier States assisting those in want of help, all moneys so advanced being considered as loans, and also undertake to raise and equip a force of Indian troops for service throughout the States; and should Great Britain be at war with any foreign Power, they engage to supply a portion of these troops on requisition for the defence of the Colony of the Straits Settlements.

It was also provided by the Treaty of 1895 that the rulers of the Federated States named meet periodically in one of the States, under the presidency of the High Commissioner, to discuss affairs of mutual interest. The first of these meetings was held at Kuala Kangsar, Perak, in July, 1897, and was attended by the High Commissioner, the rulers of all the four States, with their most important chiefs, the Resident-General, and all the British Residents. The meeting was in every respect a success, and many important matters were discussed and arrangements made to deal with them in the councils of the various States.

The second meeting was held at Kuala Lumpur in July, 1903, and was also a pronounced success in every way; the Sultan of Perak expressed for himself and the other Malay rulers entire satisfaction with the administration of affairs.

The length of open line is 392 miles, as follows:—Province Wellesley, Péarak, Selangor, Negri Sembilan, and Malacca, 23, 171, 127, 50, and 21 miles respectively. There are also 21 miles in the Negri Sembilan worked by a company.

The length of line under construction is about 32 miles in the Negri Sembilan and 120 miles in the state of Johore. The length under survey is 355 miles, 320 miles in Pahang and 35 miles in Péarak. Through communication from Prai, in Province Wellesley, to Tampin, in the Negri Sembilan, a distance of 319 miles, was made in July, 1905, and to Malacca, a distance of 340 miles, later in the same year. The total length of the whole line from Prai to Singapore, when completed, excluding branches, will be about 500 miles. The branch lines run to Port Weld, Teluk Anson, Port Swettenham, and Port Dickson.

There is also a steam ferry service between Penang and Prai, the northern terminus of the system in Province Wellesley, a distance of 5 miles.

Péarak.

H.H. Sir Idris Meradud el-Azam Sham, G.C.M.G., Sultan.

Péarak is the most northerly of the Protected States on the west coast, touching Province Wellesley on the north and Selangor on the south. It is one of the oldest States in the Peninsula, and, though subject to Achin at one time, and overrun by Kedah in 1821, it generally maintained its independence. About 1850 the discovery of tin in Larut was followed by the immigration of Chinese in great numbers. Since the appointment of a British Resident in 1874, the record of the State has been one of remarkable progress, interrupted only by the murder of the first British Resident, Mr. J. W. Birch, in 1875, the military occupation of the country, and the banishment to the Seychelles of the ex-Sultan and some chiefs implicated in the affair.

The State is well watered, the Péarak, with its tributaries the Kinta, Batang Padang, Bidor, and Sungkai, being the most important rivers. Other rivers of importance are the Krian, the Kurau, and the Bernam, with its tributary, the Slim. The mountains on the east boundary, being part of the main range of the Peninsula, rise to a height of nearly 8,000 feet.

The chief export is tin. Sugar and rice are extensively grown, and coffee plantations have been opened with success. The cultivation of rubber is now attracting great attention, and such consignments as have been exported have realised very high prices. In the Krian district the Government has nearly completed an extensive scheme for irrigation of some 63,000 acres of rice land, the larger proportion of which is already under cultivation.

Larut, Kinta and Batang Padang are the chief mining districts. The district of Batang Padang lies between the Kinta valley and the Selangor boundary, and contains rich deposits of tin and a little gold. A road and railway have recently been constructed through this part of the State.

The total mileage of completed roads in Péarak is 659 miles of cart roads, of which 531 miles are metalled, and 584 miles of bridle and other paths.

Selangor.

H.H. Sulaiman bin Almerhum Raja Musa, Sultan.

Selangor adjoins Péarak along its southern frontier. Its inhabitants are said to be the descendants of a colony from the Celebes. In this State, as in Péarak, the appointment of a British Resident in 1874 followed on the anarchy arising out of disputes connected with the tin mines. The State is drained by four rivers: the Bernam, Selangor, Klang, and Langat.

Where the State touches the central range of the Peninsula there are several peaks of over 5,000 feet, and one of 6,200 feet.

The chief town is Kwala Lumpor, which is the largest town on the mainland of the Peninsula. The chief industry of the State is tin-mining. Coffee-planting, under European supervision, which made good progress for some years, received a severe check owing to the fall in the price of Liberian coffee; rice, pepper, and other products have been grown with success. Of recent years the cultivation of rubber has made great strides, especially in the Klang district, where large areas are being planted. The rubber exported is well reported on, and good prices have been realised. Coconuts also are receiving attention. The total mileage in Selangor is 491 miles of cart roads, of which 389 miles are metalled, and 198 miles of bridle paths.

Negri Sembilan (Nine States).

H.H. Tungku Mohamed, C.M.G., Yang di Pertuan of Sri Menanti and the Chiefs.

The Federal State of the Negri Sembilan, as at present constituted, dates from 1895; but a Federation under that title already existed in the last century. The present federation consists of the following States, viz., Sungei Ujong, Jelebu, Johol, and Rembau, and of the six smaller States of Ulu Muar, Jempol, Terachi, Gunong Pasir, Inas, Tampin, and Gemencheh. The headquarters of the Resident are at Seremban; and there are district officers at Port Dickson, on the coast, Kwala Klawang in Jelebu, Kwala Pilah in Ulu Muar, and Tampin. The total mileage of roads
in the Negri Sembilan is 316 miles of cart roads, of which 210 miles are metalled, and 172 miles of bridle paths.

The revenue is derived mainly from tin and agriculture. The miners are Chinese, the Malay population being almost entirely agricultural. Gold reefs exist in Gemencheh and on the Muar River. Coffee has been successfully cultivated, and there are many large tapioca and gambier estates. Rubber has also been extensively planted in recent years. There is also a considerable production of rice. A great part of the State is mountainous, the rest consisting of undulating country. The whole State is well watered, the chief rivers being the Muar and the Linggi, the latter of which forms, for some distance, the boundary between the State and the territory of Malacca.

Pahang.

H.H. Sir Ahmad Mauham Shah Ahmad, K.C.M.G., Sultan.

Pahang, the largest of the Protected Native States, is on the east coast of the Peninsula. Its native rulers have for many years looked southward, of later years to the Colony, for protection against their northern neighbours.

Gunong Tahan, probably the highest summit in the Peninsula (nearly 8,000 feet), was ascended for the first time in 1905 by Mr. H. C. Robinson; it lies on or near the northern boundary between Pahang and Kelantan.

The State is drained by one of the largest rivers in the Peninsula, if not the largest, the Pahang River, which is fed by the Lipis, Jelai, Tembeling, Samantan, Triang, Bara Lui, and other rivers. To the north the Kuantan and to the south the Rompin and Endau also debouch into the China Sea, the last-named forming the boundary between Pahang and Johore.

These rivers are unfortunately so shallow as to be navigable for only steam launches and other small craft, except in the rainy season; and during the north-east monsoon their mouths are difficult of access.

The country is rich in gold, tin, and galena, and several companies under European or Australian direction are at work. The capital has hitherto been Pekan, near the mouth of the Pahang River, where the Sultan still resides, but the seat of government has been removed 200 miles up stream to Kuala Lipis. A line of telegraph has been carried from Selangor over the dividing range to Lipis in this State, and a cart road, 83 miles in length, has been constructed from Kuala Kubu, on the F.M.S. Railway, to Kuala Lipis. There is a daily motor car service on this road. A branch road has also been made with Government assistance from Tras to Bentong, a distance of some 20 miles, for the purpose of opening up the mines in that district, and a trunk road from Bentong to Kuala Pilah in the Negri Sembilan is under construction.
