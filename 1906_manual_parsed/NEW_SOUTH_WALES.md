NEW SOUTH WALES.

Limits and Area.

The State of New South Wales lies on the eastern coast of Australia, almost entirely between the 29th and 36th parallels of south latitude, and between the 141st and 153rd meridians east of Greenwich. It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, to which it presents a coast line extending over 700 miles, from Point Danger at its north-eastern extremity to Cape Howe at the south-east. From the point last mentioned, which is also the north-east limit of the State of Victoria, it is bounded by an imaginary line running in a north-westerly direction to the source of the Indi, a stream rising at the foot of Forest Hill, a few miles south of the Pilot Mountain, one of the most conspicuous peaks of the Australian Alps. The southern boundary of the State follows the course of the Indi, and afterwards of the Murray, into which the first-named stream ultimately merges, as far as the 141st meridian of east longitude. The intersection of the Murray with this meridian forms a common point of the three States of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.

On the west, the State is separated from South Australia by the line of the 141st meridian, as far as its intersection with the 29th parallel of south latitude, at which point New South Wales, South Australia, and Queensland touch. Commencing at this point, the northern boundary of the State follows the 29th degree of latitude, till it is crossed by the Macintyre River, one of the upper branches of the Darling, not far from the 149th meridian. Thence it follows the course of the Macintyre upward, to the junction of its tributary, the Dumaresq; leaving the Macintyre it follows the tributary stream till it meets a spur extending from the main Dividing Range to the junction of Tenterfield Creek and the Dumaresq. The boundary runs along this spur until it joins the main range, thence, almost parallel to the coast, it follows the Dividing Range to Wilson's Peak, where the Macpherson Range branches eastward. Following the last-named range, the northern boundary reaches the coast at Point Danger.

The area comprised within these limits is estimated at 310,700 square miles, or 198,848,000 acres, being a little over two-and-a-half times that of Great Britain and Ireland. Excluding the surface covered by rivers and lakes, the area would be 195,882,150 acres, or about 306,066 square miles.

The length of the State, from Point Danger on the north to Cape Howe on the south, is 680 miles. From east to west, along the 29th parallel, the breadth is 760 miles, while diagonally from the south-west corner, where the Murray passes into South Australia, to Point Danger, the length reaches 850 miles.

Sydney, the seat of Government, is in 33° 51' 41" S. lat., and 151° 12' 42" E. long.

Of the total area of the State, 49,269,804 acres have been alienated, or are in the process of alienation.

The number of Alienated Holdings over one acre in extent for the year ended 31st March, 1905, were:

| Acres | Number |
|-------|--------|
| 1 to 30 | 24,640 |
| 31 to 400 | 35,787 |
| 401 to 1,000 | 9,011 |
| 1,001 to 10,000 | 5,512 |
| 10,001 and upwards | 722 |

Total | 75,672 |
History.

This part of the Australian coast is said to have been discovered by Portuguese and Dutch navigators in the 17th century, but no settlement was made. Captain Cook explored it in 1770, and gave it the name of New South Wales, but the first settlement was not formed until 1788, at Port Jackson, under Captain Phillip, R.N. The capital was named after Viscount Sydney, who was Secretary of State for the Colonies when the settlement was formed.

The Settlement of New South Wales was then held to include the whole eastern portion of the continent. The first newspaper was established in 1803. The population in 1800 was 4,958. The Merino sheep was introduced in 1797. The passage through the Blue Mountains, giving access to the interior plains, was not discovered until 1813. Moroton Bay was settled in 1824. In 1828 the total population was only 36,598. Convicts ceased to arrive in 1841. The discovery of gold in 1851 led to a very rapid growth of what is now Victoria, settled in 1836, which was made a separate Colony in 1851. Responsible government was established in 1855. Moreton Bay, to the north, was constituted a separate Colony in 1859, under the name of Queensland. On the 1st January, 1901, the Colony of New South Wales united with the Colonies of Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania, in a Federal Commonwealth of Australia.

Climate.

The climate of New South Wales affords a wide range of temperature; from Kiandra, where the mean in shade in 1904 was 44°3', to Lismore, Brewarrina, Walgett 67°2', and Morce, where it was 70°6'30"6', and 67°2' respectively. On the coast it varied from 54°7' at Mittagong to 70° at Lismore, Sydney being 62°4', almost the same as Barcelona.(?) On the mountains snow lies in a few places all the winter. At Bathurst the mean temperature was 56°7', and on the inland plains about 65°6'.

The rainfall decreases as the distance from the coast increases. The total fall during 1904 at Sydney was 46 inches; and the days on which rain fell 155. At London the number of days is 146, and the amount 24 inches; 25 per cent. of this falls in quantities of half an inch and upwards in a day, while Sydney in 155 days has 46 inches. Fifty years' experience in Sydney has never furnished one month entirely without rain; but in dry periods several months sometimes pass consecutively during which the fall is too small for water supply; and of England exactly the same remark has been made.

The prevalent winds in summer are the northeast sea-breeze and light westerly; in winter, dry cold westerly, and wet S. and S.E.

In winter, on the lowlands, frosts are common in the southern and rare in the northern districts.

Trade and Industry.

The great staple produce of New South Wales is wool.

The export of wool the produce of the State during the past twelve years has been as follows:—

Interest is allowed at the rate of 3½ per cent. per annum on deposits up to 200l., on accounts closed during the year, and 4 per cent. on accounts remaining open. When deposits made by any one individual exceed the sum of 200l., no interest is allowed on such excess; but this regulation, as in the case of the Post Office Savings Banks, does not apply to the deposits of Penny Savings Banks, Charitable Institutions, and Friendly Societies.

The Government (Post Office) Savings Banks, established in 1871, had, on 30th June, 1904, 7,475,058l. deposited by 243,794 depositors. Interest is allowed at the rate of 3½ per cent. per annum on all deposits up to 300l.

Means of Communication.

There are 53,892 miles of roads (including 7,683 miles of municipal roads and streets). In addition, there are 3,446 bridges of 20 feet span and over, covering a length of 327,384 feet; 41,286 culverts = 584,839 feet. There are also 120 punts, 2 horse boats, 3 steam launches, 91 flood boats, 111 other boats belonging to the Government used for ferries. There are 3,281 miles of railways, owned and worked by the Government, the total cost of construction having been 43,062,554l. The receipts during the year ended 30th June, 1905, were 3,684,016l., and the working expenses 2,192,147l., the balance therefore available towards meeting the annual charge for interest being 1,491,869l. There are also 81½ miles of private railway, the capital expenditure on which amounted to 553,389l. There are 125½ miles of Government tramways, earning 813,560l., against working expenses amounting to 683,682l. The total capital expenditure on tramways was 3,037,922l.

Of telegraphs there are 14,491 miles open, with 67,038 miles of wire, with 1,005 stations. The cost of construction was 1,323,818l., and the revenue received during 1904, 151,036l.

Of inland rivers the Murray, Darling, Murrumbidgee, and Lachlan are navigable most of the year, and nearly all the coast rivers are navigable, especially the Richmond, the Clarence, the Macleay, the Manning, the Hunter, the Hawkesbury, and the Shoalhaven, while Port Jackson, Port Stephens and Jervis Bay are unrivalled natural harbours. Steamers leave Sydney regularly for nearly all parts of the world, but the direct communication with Europe is chiefly by the vessels of the P. and O. (via Colombo and Brindisi), the Orient-Pacific lines (via Suez and Naples), and by those of the Messageries Maritimes (via Marseilles), Oceanic Company (via San Francisco), Canadian Australian line (via Vancouver), North German Lloyd (via Genoa). Ten mails per month are sent to and received from England.

The rates of postage in and from the State are:

| Letters, Newspapers |

Education.

The education system of New South Wales is under the control of the Minister of Public Instruction, regulated by the Education Act of 1880. Teachers are recognised as Public Servants, and are paid by fixed salaries. The school fee is 3½ per week per child, the limit of fees for one family being 1s., and the fees collected are paid...
into the Treasury as revenue. Free education is granted where inability to pay the prescribed fee is shown. Education is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 14 years.

In 1904 there were 2,870 State schools divided into 3,091 departments in operation, namely 4 high schools, 2 for boys and 2 for girls, 2,503 public and half-time schools, 460 provisional schools, 20 house-to-house schools, and 38 evening public schools. The State has been divided into public school districts, with one Local Board appointed for each district. School buildings are erected wholly at the expense of the Government. Denominational schools have ceased to be supported by the State, but general religious instruction is imparted by the State teachers, and clergymen of the various denominations are entitled to appropriate one hour a day for religious instruction in the tenets of their respective Churches. For the year 1904 the net cost to the State of public instruction was £757,666. In 1904, 240,631 children attended the ordinary State schools, and 777 were inmates of the ragged schools, free kindergarten schools, and the school for the deaf and dumb and the blind, whilst 625 were inmates of the reformatories and industrial schools. In 1904, private schools, including Church schools, showed a total enrolment during December quarter of 57,811, and an average attendance of 46,667.

The University of Sydney was established and endowed by the State in 1852. Its State endowment was originally 5,000L, and from 1890 to 1892 was as high as 13,900L, but it has now been reduced to 10,000L. The endowment is largely added to by annual special grants and by private donations. The State endowment and special grants for 1904 amounted to 13,500L. Three denominational colleges are affiliated to the University, each having a State endowment of 500L per annum. In addition, there is the women's college, also affiliated, having a similar endowment. The University has the power of granting degrees in arts, law, medicine, science, and engineering. Recently, several faculties have been added to its curriculum. The number of students in 1904 was 820. In the metropolis there is a public grammar school, with an enrolment of 660 pupils, and having a State endowment of 1,500L. There is also a technical college, under the Department of Public Instruction, and classes are held in Sydney and in the principal country towns. The fees are within the reach of all, and the college is open to males and females alike. During 1904, 544 classes were held, and 13,254 students attended; the Government advanced the sum of 25,762L during the year. Public libraries and schools of art are established throughout the State. There are also a Royal, a Medical, a Linnaean, a Zoological, a Geographical, and an Art Society, a Government Observatory, Agricultural and Forestry Museum, and a Mining and Geological, also Technological Museums, a Government Agricultural College, Experimental Farms, with many other educational associations. The expenditure for the year ending 31st December, 1904, for the Public Library of New South Wales was 9,543L; for the Australian Museum, 7,331L, and for the National Art Gallery, 3,413L.

The total State expenditure during 1903-4 for educational purposes was 966,180L.

**Defence.**

Batteries with heavy guns have been erected at South, Middle, and George's Heads, Sydney Harbour, also at Newcastle and Botany, and along the coast.

Local Government.

This is regulated mainly by the Municipalities Act of 1897, a consolidating measure, which governs all municipalities with the exception of the city of Sydney. Altogether there are 192 boroughs and municipal districts (including city of Sydney), controlling property of the annual value of £542,060., and having a revenue in 1904-05 of £35,775., exclusive of loans, an expenditure of £1,024,044., and an outstanding debt of £2,941,930.; but against this are accumulated sinking funds of £64,739., and other assets, making a total of £3,873,876.

Manufactories and Works.

In 1904 there were 3,632 Manufactories and Works, employing 68,036 hands, of which 53,457 were males and 14,579 females.

Constitution.

The first Legislative Council dates from 1824; it was greatly enlarged and made chiefly elective in 1842. "Responsible government" was established by the Constitution Act, 18 & 19 Vict., cap. 54 (1855). The Governor is appointed by the Crown; so also is the Legislative Council, which consists of not fewer than 21 persons, of whom not less than four-fifths must be persons not holding office under the Crown, except officers on H.M.'s sea or land forces on full or half pay. The members of the first Legislative Council were appointed for 5 years, but all subsequent appointments have been made for life, subject to certain provisions contained in the Act. The Council at present consists of 61 members, who are not paid, with the exception of the President and Chairman of Committees, and any members who may accept portfolios in a Ministry. All members are privileged to travel free over all Government Railways and Tramways.

The Legislative Assembly, under the "Electoral Act of 1880," consisted of 141 members, representing 74 electoral districts; and provision was made for giving increased representation to the several constituencies according to growth of population. The qualification for election to the Assembly extended to "every male subject of Her Majesty of the full age of 21 years and absolutely free, being a natural-born or naturalised subject," with certain special exceptions.

The electoral franchise was given, subject to certain official and other disqualifications, to "every male subject of Her Majesty of the full age of 21 years and absolutely free, being a natural-born or naturalised subject," if entered on the Roll of Electors, under one or other of the following heads:

1. "Resident Electors.—Six months in district.
2. "Non-Resident Electors.—Every such subject, whether or not so resident as aforesaid, who shall have at the time of making out the said Electoral List, and for the six months then next preceding shall have had within the district a freehold or leasehold estate in possession of the clear value of 10l., or of the annual value of 10l., respectively, or who shall then occupy, and for the said six months have occupied, within the district any house, of the annual value of 10l., or who shall hold, and for the said six months shall have held, a Crown lease or license for pastoral purposes within such district."

A new Act of Parliament, assented to June 13th, 1893, provided for the division of the State into 125 electorates, each represented by only one member. The new Act also abolished the property qualification and plural voting, and established the "one-man-one-vote" system. Every male of the full age of 21 years, being a natural-born or naturalised subject, and who shall have resided in the State for a continuous period of one year, and shall have been resident three months in the electoral district for which he claims an elector's right, is qualified as an elector. As this was found to practically disfranchise a large number of the population, the period was, by an amending Act passed in 1896, reduced to one month, during which period the elector retained his qualification in the electorate from which he has removed. Under this law the elections all take place on one and the same day. The first election under this Act took place on July 17th, 1894; the second on July 24th, 1895; the third on July 27th, 1898; and the fourth on July 3rd, 1901. Under an amending Act, passed in 1896, the franchise has been conferred on members of the police force, who are all in the employment of the State, and not controlled by local bodies.

During 1902 the franchise was extended to women.

The voting at elections is by ballot, as it was also under the old electoral Acts of 1888 and 1881, now repealed.

Early in 1904 the State was divided into 90 electorates, each of which has one member to represent it in the Legislative Assembly. The General Election, held in August, 1904, was the first election held after the new divisions had been made.

The Assembly lasts for three years, unless previously dissolved. Under a law passed in 1889, members receive 300l. per annum each; in addition, Members also travel free over the Government railways and tramways in the State, and are provided with official stamped envelopes for the free transmission of correspondence through the post.
