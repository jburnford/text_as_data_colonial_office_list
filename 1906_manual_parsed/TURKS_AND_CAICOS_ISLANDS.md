TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Turks and Caicos Islands lie between 21° and 22° N. lat., and 71° and 72° 37' W. long. Their area is 169 square miles, about the size of Rutland. The most important island, Grand Turk, is 6½ miles long and 2 miles broad. According to the census of 1901 Grand Turk contains 1,751 inhabitants, being one-third of the total population. Cockburn Harbour in S. Caicos, immediately opposite Grand Turk, is the principal settlement in the Caicos group.

History.

Grand Turk claims, like many other islands, to have been the scene of the first discovery of Columbus, but the group remained uninhabited till the end of the 17th century, when it began to be annually visited by salt rakers from Bermuda. These were expelled by the Spaniards in 1710, but soon returned, and for some 40 years continued this industry with more or less frequent interruption by attacks from the Spaniards. It was not, however, till 1799 that, for the purposes of government, they were included in the Colony of the Bahamas, to which group they geographically belong. In 1848 they were made independent of the Bahamas, and were placed under the Governor of Jamaica, an arrangement which still continues.

Industries.

Salt raking is the only industry of any importance, the quantity annually gathered being about 1,800,000 bushels, equal to 60,000 tons. The export of salt in 1904 was valued at £15,079. Sponges are found in some quantities on the Caicos Bank, but are chiefly collected by Bahamas schooners and carried to Nassau. There are three sponge curing establishments on the Caicos Islands. The export of sponge in 1904 was valued at £1,414. The cultivation of the sisal fibre (or Pitta plant) has been introduced, and has a fair prospect of success. 463,695 lbs. were exported in 1904, valued at £6,887.

Practically the whole of the food and household necessaries are imported. The commercial intercourse is almost wholly with the United States.

The inhabitants are of mixed European and African extraction, the proportion of whites to coloured people being larger than in most of the West Indies. The majority of the people are connected with the Bermudas, from which these islands were first settled. They all speak English. Grand Turk is a port of registry, and had, on the 31st December, 1904, 62 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 4,645 tons. Salt Cay and Cockburn Harbour are ports of entry, possessing good anchorage.

Climate.

The climate is equable and healthy, and rarely unpleasantly hot, owing to the strong and never-failing sea breezes, but there is a scarcity of fresh provisions and good water, owing to the low lying barren nature of the soil.

The mean temperature (day) is 82°, the extreme range being from 65° to 92°. The rainfall during 1904 amounted to 44 inches, the rainy season being from October to February. Hurricanes occasionally visit the groups.

Means of Communication.

A steamer of Messrs. Pickford and Black, running under Government contract, leaves Halifax for Jamaica on the 15th of every month, calling at Grand Turk both going and returning. The length of voyage between England and Turks Islands is about fourteen days via New York, and eighteen days via Halifax or Jamaica.

The steamers of the Imperial Direct West India Mail Service between Bristol and Jamaica call off Grand Turk every two weeks to land mails and passengers. Length of voyage 11 days.

The Clyde Line from New York to St. Domingo call at Grand Turk every two or three weeks, the length of passage being five days.

There are no railways or telegraph lines in the Colony.

The estimated number of letters to the United Kingdom is 3,500, and to all other countries 14,000 per annum.

The rate of letter postage is 1d. per half ounce to all countries included in the penny post arrangement; outside that, 2½d. per half ounce. There is no internal post.

Cable communication with Bermuda and Jamaica was established by the Direct West India Cable Company in January, 1898, the station being fixed at Grand Turk. The rates are per word: To England 3s., to Jamaica 1s., to Halifax 2s.

Education.

There are seven elementary schools supported by Government, with an average attendance in 1904 of 585 children. The schools are entirely unsectarian, and are at present free.

Currency and Banking.

The coins in circulation, all of them being legal tender under Bahama Acts, 2 Vict. cap. 4, and 8 Vict. cap. 49, also Jamaica Law 10 of 1880, consist of British sterling, United States gold and silver, Spanish, Mexican, and Columbian gold doubloons, and Jamaica nickel tokens. There is no limit to the legal tender of silver. There is a local Government paper currency of ten shillings and one pound notes. Commercial accounts are usually kept in dollars, and Government accounts in sterling. A Government savings bank was established on 1st Jan., 1890, and had, on 31st Dec., 1904, 223 depositors, with £1,492/. deposit.

Constitution.

The Legislature consists of a Legislative Board comprising the Commissioner and Judge and not less than two, nor more than four, other persons appointed by the Governor of Jamaica. Taxation and expenditure and all local matters, are regulated by this board. Laws passed by the Legislative Council of Jamaica which are in express terms made applicable to Turks Islands take effect there. The subjects of currency, bills of exchange, patents, and the custody of prisoners and lunatics have been so dealt with.
