ORANGE RIVER COLONY.

Situation, Area, and Population.

The Orange River Colony lies to the north of the Orange River and Cape Colony, and to the south of the Vaal River. On the east it is bounded by Basutoland and Natal. The area is about 50,000 square miles, and the country, which lies at an altitude of 4,000 to 5,000 feet above the sea, consists chiefly of grassy plains; but to the east, on the Basutoland border, it is hilly. The rainfall is moderate, and the country is mainly devoted to stock-farming, though grain is raised in parts. The population in 1904 was 387,315, of whom 142,679 were white.

History and Constitution.

The Orange River was first crossed by a European in 1760, but no attempt was made to settle the country for many years after. Emigrants from the great trek established themselves at Winburg and elsewhere, but the Colonial Government for some time made no attempt to establish any administration. In 1848, however, owing to the disputes between the settlers and the natives, Sir Harry Smith issued a Proclamation declaring the whole territory between the Orange River and Vaal River to be under the sovereignty of the Queen, and a British Resident was appointed at Bloemfontein, with Assistant-Commissioners at Winburg and the Caledon River. The discontented farmers under Pretorius took up arms, but were defeated by Sir Harry Smith at Boomplaats. The British Government, however, before long determined to abandon the territory; and in 1854 Sir George Clerk, the Special Commissioner for "the settling and adjustment of the affairs of the Orange River Sovereignty," signed the Convention of Bloemfontein, by which, much against the will of many of the inhabitants, British sovereignty was withdrawn, and the independence of the country was recognised.

The history of the Orange Free State was in the main peaceable, but a good deal of fighting followed with the Basutos, and in 1866 Moabieh was compelled to cede much of his best cornland. The Basutos appealed to the High Commissioner and were taken under British protection, but by the Treaty of Aliwal North in 1869 the incorporation of the conquered territory into the Orange Free State was recognised.

About the same time the discovery of diamonds at Kimberley and the inrush of diggers led to a dispute between Her Majesty's Government and that of the Orange Free State as to the boundary, which was ultimately settled in 1876 by a Convention signed in London by President Brand providing for a payment by Great Britain of a sum of 90,000l. in consideration of the abandonment of the Free State claim.

In 1889, not long after the death of President Brand, whose wisdom and moderation had won general recognition, the Orange Free State entered into an alliance with the South African Republic. This alliance was renewed in 1897 and was appealed to as binding the Free State to assist the South African Republic in her quarrel with Great Britain in 1899. This course was determined on by a resolution of the Volksraad taken on the 27th of September, 1899, and resulted in the annexation of the country to the British dominions by a

*For an account of the events leading up to the war, and the war itself, see "Transvaal."
Proclamation of Lord Roberts issued on the 28th of May, 1900, the new Colony being called the Orange River Colony, and Lord Roberts being appointed Administrator. Sir Alfred Milner succeeded to the Administration on the departure of Lord Roberts from South Africa at the end of the year 1900, and was afterwards selected for appointment as Governor both of the Transvaal and of the Orange River Colony. Major (now Sir) H. J. Goold-Adams was selected for the post of Lieutenant-Governor. Early in 1905 Lord Milner resigned, and in May of that year his successor, Lord Selborne, arrived in South Africa.

The Government of the Orange Free State consisted of a President, elected every five years, assisted by an Executive Council and a Volksraad, containing 60 members, half of whom retired every two years. The Orange Free State had since 1889 been a member of the Customs Union, to which the Cape and latterly Natal also belonged. In the same year the railway to the Vaal was completed by the Cape Government, which continued to work the line until after the Jameson raid, when the Free State took it over.

By Letters Patent published on the 24th June, 1902, it was declared that there should be a Governor and Commander-in-Chief and also a Lieutenant-Governor in the Colony, and that there should be an Executive Council, to consist of such persons as should be directed by Royal Instructions, and a Legislative Council, to consist of the Lieutenant-Governor together with such persons, not being less than two at any time, as may be directed by Royal Instructions. The Legislative Council is empowered to establish such ordinances, and to constitute such courts and officers, and to make such provisions and regulations for the proceedings in such courts, and for the administration of justice, as may be necessary for the peace, order, and good government of the Colony; but power of disallowance of ordinances and also power of legislation is reserved to the Crown. The South African Constabulary is declared to be under the direct control of the High Commissioner.

The estimates for 1899 approved by the Raad fixed the revenue at 656,914l., of which 323,314l. was from Railways and 121,000l. from Customs. This, with a balance carried forward from the previous year and temporary loans, made a total of 948,523l. The expenditure was estimated at 948,523l., including 290,758l. for new railway work and 108,124l. for paying off debt. The total debt in 1898 was 1,830,000l. The total trade in the same year was 1,923,428l. exports, and 1,190,923l. imports.

The actual revenue of the Colony amounted in the year ending 30th June, 1905, to 786,049l. (excluding railway profits), and the expenditure to 780,635l. (including a contribution to the revenue of the Inter-Colonial Council of 175,000l.). (See under "South Africa" and "Transvaal.") It is remarkable, considering the adverse seasons, the withdrawal of capital for re-building and re-stocking, and other unfavourable circumstances, that the financial position, which depends mainly on the value of imports, is so good.

### Railways

The railway system in the Orange River Colony consists of:

1. A main line connecting the Cape Colony ports of Capetown and Port Elizabeth with Johannesburg, running from Mid Norval's Pont Bridge to Mid Vaal River Bridge, a distance of 334 miles.
2. The following branch lines:—Mid Bethulie Bridge to Springfontein Junction (28 miles); Springfontein to Jagersfontein (49 miles); Bloemfontein to Modderpoort (85 miles); Smaldeel Junction to Winburg (26 miles); Vloehoek to Heilbron (30 miles); and Tempe Junction to Tempe Cantonments (4 miles); as well as the section Vaal River to Vierfontein. To these must be added a line from the Natal border to Bethlehem worked by the Natal Government.

The following lines are under construction:—Jagersfontein to Fauresmith (8 miles); Marseilles to Maseru (16 miles); Modderpoort to Ladybrand (6 miles); Dover to Parys (22 miles); Modderpoort to Bethlehem (113 miles); and Bethlehem to Kroonstad (82 miles).

The last-named line is being built by the Natal Government, and the agreements for the construction of the line from Bethlehem to Modderpoort out of Central South African Railways' new construction funds have just been signed. Negotiations are also proceeding with a view, if possible, to the construction of a line from Bloemfontein to Kimberley. The railways are worked under the name of the Central South African Railways, and administered by the Inter-Colonial Council of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony.*

### Climate

The Orange River Colony can be separated, roughly, into three divisions—viz., the western, the middle, and the eastern.

The western division is the driest, but is the best for grazing of sheep. The soil is fertile, but requires irrigation.

The middle division, through which the railway runs, holds moisture longer than the western division, and will grow certain crops without irrigation. There are large tracts of grass lands good for grazing stock.

The eastern division is the best watered of the three, the climate being moist. This division is the wheat-growing area, and large quantities of wheat and other cereals can be grown. It is fairly well adapted for stock, but the winter is somewhat severe.

The heat, especially in the middle and western divisions, is great during the months of December.*

* See under South Africa.
January, and February, the temperature at Bloemfontein, altitude 4,510 feet above the sea, often rising on individual days to 106° and 108° Fahr. at 12 noon in the shade, the mean maximum being 76°7' and the mean minimum 45°3'.

The eastern division is cooler, and in winter it is no unusual sight to see snow on the mountains. Harrismith is a great summer resort for the people of Durban and Maritzburg (Natal), the temperature there being cool and delightful in summer.

The climate of Bloemfontein is well adapted for those suffering from phthisis, and has long been known as a health resort for this disease.

The rainfall is most abundant in the summer, when the south-east trades are prevalent. The mean annual rainfall for Bloemfontein for 16 years was 24 inches. In the eastern division it would be considerably more.

Dust storms are frequent in spring.

The population of Bloemfontein has increased from 2,077 whites in 1890 to 15,501 whites in 1904. The gross value of the buildings constructed during 1905 was approximately 300,000£. (not including the extension of the Government offices, costing 80,000£.). The rateable value of property has risen as follows:

| Year | Value (£) |
|------|----------|
| 1901 | 709,753   |
| 1902 | 1,045,345 |
| 1903 | 1,531,370 |
| 1904 | 1,841,165 |
| 1905 | 1,980,665 |

After the disastrous flood of the 17th January 1904, it was decided to straighten the course of the Bloemspruit which runs through the town. This has now been completed at an approximate cost of 157,000£. The Sanna's Post Waterworks (28,000,000 gallons) have been supplemented by reservoirs at Magdepoort (220,000,000 gallons) and Moches Dam (460,000,000 gallons) at a cost of 245,000£.; while a sewerage scheme is being carried out at a cost of 96,000£. A system of electric tramways is also being considered.

Currency and Banking.

British sterling and the gold of the late South African Republic are legal tender, and accounts are kept in British sterling.

Under the law of the late Orange Free State the National Bank of the Orange River Colony (in which the Government is represented by 70,000£. out of the total share capital of 100,000£.), and the Bank of Africa were the only ones that were legally entitled to transact business in the Colony, but banking has since been made free for all banks obtaining the permission of the Government to open branches. The banks at present represented are the National Bank, the Standard Bank, the Bank of Africa, the African Banking Corporation and the National Bank of South Africa.

Notes of all the above banks are in circulation in the Colony.

Industries.

The leading, if not exclusive, industry of the country is agriculture, inclusive of stock and sheep-farming. The value of the total mining output increased during the year ending 30th June, 1905, to 993,917£., as against 833,657£. for the previous year. There are several coal mines open, of which the Clydesdale Collieries Company is the most important. The value of the coal mined amounted in the year under review to 55,293£., but the output for the coming year is expected to be at least 500 per cent. better. Three diamond mines are actively at work, and yield a value of about 70,000£. a month. Prospecting or both diamonds and gold is being energetically carried on; hitherto not with very encouraging results in the case of diamonds, but the rand formation has been struck by a drill at 1,200 feet near Villiers. Good building stone is obtainable near to Bloemfontein and at other places in the Colony, especially at Ladybrand. Excellent pottery clay has been found near Bloemfontein, and a small factory has been started by some Italian potters with the aid of a small Government grant. A jam factory has likewise just been opened in the same town.

Land Settlement.

Although the seasons 1903-4 and 1904-5 were bad, the settlers have been enabled to tide them over. The total area of purchased land to June 30th, 1905, amounted to 1,108,521 acres, costing 845,904£. Practically every acre of purchased land, available for allotment to settlers, has been taken up. Up to 30th June, 1905, there were 700 heads of families, of which 598 are British, and 102 Dutch. Land has been reserved for the Imperial South African Association, while arrangements have been made for a limited number of selected reservists from the Royal Garrison Regiment to be placed with certain settlers.

Public Works.

The planning and construction of public buildings has proceeded steadily. The funds available from revenue have been supplemented by a loan of 500,000£. from Inter-Colonial Loan Funds. Ten public offices, thirteen post offices, ten permanent and fifty temporary schools, and various other buildings have been constructed. The extension of the main Government offices at Bloemfontein has been commenced.

Education.

The educational policy of the Government is administered through the Education Department. Hitherto, the schools have been managed, teachers appointed, and all expenditure borne by the Government. However, in terms of an agreement recently come to between the Government and representatives of the Dutch Reformed Church, the lately organised Christian National Schools have been amalgamated with the Government Schools of the Colony.

Under the provisions of the "Public Education Ordinance, 1905," the areas of jurisdiction of the local Education Committees have been enlarged, and the bare majority of the members will be elected by the ratepayers. The powers of these Committees will also be extended in view of the proportion of local financial responsibility imposed upon them under the above-mentioned Ordinance.

At the end of June, 1904, there was an attendance of 12,507 children, which, by the 31st May, 1906, had increased to an approximate total of 14,500, or more than twice the number under the former Government. Education in all schools, with the exception of High schools, is free and open to all children of full European parentage, and the Education Ordinance of 1906 provides for compulsory attendance, subject to certain conditions.

A Normal School in Bloemfontein provides for the training of teachers, and bursaries are given on the results of an entrance examination.

In accordance with an agreement arrived at in June, 1905, between the Government and all the leading denominations in the Colony, religious
instruction of a purely historical character is given for two hours every week, and may be given in the Dutch language. Facilities are also afforded to the ministers of the various denominations to give instruction to the children of their own congregations immediately after school hours, for one hour one day each week, in cases where the parents make a special request for such instruction.
