HONG KONG.

Situation and Area.

Hong Kong is one of a number of Islands situated off the south-eastern coast of China, at the mouth of the Canton River, and lies about 40 miles east of Macao, 91 miles south of Canton, between 22° 9' and 22° 17' N. lat., and 114° 5' and 114° 18' E. long. The island is an irregular ridge, stretching nearly east and west; its broken and abrupt peaks rising to the height of nearly 2,000 feet above the sea level. Its length is about 11 miles, its breadth from 2 to 5 miles, its area rather more than 29 square miles (a third larger than Guernsey). It is separated from the mainland of China by a narrow strait, known as the Ly-ee-moon Pass, which does not exceed half a mile in width. The opposite peninsula of Kowloon (2½ square miles) was ceded to Great
Britain by a Treaty entered into by Lord Elgin in 1861 with the Government of China, and now forms part of the Colony; which also includes Stonecutters' Green, Aplechow, Middle, Round, and other islets.

In 1898 an agreement was concluded with the Chinese Government for the extension of Hong Kong territory by an area adjacent to British Kowloon, in the province of Kwong-tung, including Mirs Bay and Deep Bay, this area to be leased for 99 years; a stipulation was included that within the walled city of Kowloon (which lies outside of British Kowloon) the Chinese officials then stationed there should continue to exercise jurisdiction except so far as might be inconsistent with the military requirements for the defence of Hong Kong, but that within the remainder of the newly-leased territory Great Britain should have sole jurisdiction. In 1899 the Chinese officials ceased to exercise jurisdiction within Kowloon City, which thereafter, by Her late Majesty's Order in Council, was incorporated in the leased territory and became subject to British rule. The area of the mainland leased is over 300 square miles, and a careful survey of the territory was completed in 1904. This new territory has its headquarters at Hough Tai P6 on an arm of Mirs Bay. An Assistant Superintendent of Police, who is also a Magistrate with limited powers, and an Assistant Land Officer, reside there.

General Description.

The waterways of the Colony form one of the most magnificent harbours in the world, having an area of ten square miles. The granite hills which surround it rise between 2,000 and 3,000 feet high, the whole offering a coup d'œil which blends the wild scenery of Scotland with the classic beauty of Italy. The city of Victoria extends for four miles at the base of the hills which protect the south side of the harbour, and contains, with its suburbs, nearly 300,000 inhabitants. Being built on the slope of the hills facing the sea, the general aspect of the town is perhaps more striking and picturesque from the water than that of any other city in the east, whilst many of the streets are shaded with well-grown and handsome trees. On the new Praya West Reclamation, completed in 1903, some new and handsome buildings stand, and others are in course of erection.

The rainfall for 1904 was 80.41 inches as compared with 93.65 inches in 1903, and 97.5 in 1902. The mean 1895—1904 was 77.33. The range of the thermometer in 1904 was from 91.1° in June to 44.8° in December. The rainy season extends from May to October; the wettest month in 1904 was August, with 27.64 inches. The year was singularly free from typhoons.

History.

The Colony, then a desolate island, sparsely inhabited by fishermen, was ceded to Great Britain in January, 1841; the cession was confirmed by the Treaty of Nankin, in August, 1842; and the charter bears date 5th April, 1843. The additions subsequently obtained on the mainland have been noted above.

Hong Kong did not become of much commercial importance until the discovery of gold in Australia, in 1851, and the consequent Chinese emigration. Its trade has gradually increased with the opening up of China to foreign trade.

Large local banking, dock, steamboat, and insurance companies were established between 1865 and 1872, and the trade was greatly increased by the opening of the Suez Canal.

The city is the depot for an incessant flow of Chinese emigration and immigration, the number in 1904 being 225,499 (principally to and from the Straits); emigrants, 76,304; immigrants, 149,195, excluding to and from China ports. A depot was opened in 1904 for coolies emigrating to the Rand mines in the Transvaal.

Industry.

The island produces little or nothing, but its position has made it a centre of trade in many kinds of goods. Amongst the principal are opium, sugar, flour, salt, earthenware, oil, amber, cotton, and cotton goods, sandal-wood, ivory, betel, vegetables, live stock, granite, &c., &c. The transactions of the tea and silk trade are largely controlled by Hong Kong firms. There are a few manufactories, which are rapidly increasing in number and importance, producing rope, sugar, rum, paper, vermilion, sauce, bricks, tiles and cement, bamboo work, and stores of every description for the supply of shipping. There is a considerable boat-building industry among the Chinese.

Shipping.

As Hong Kong is a free port, it is impossible to give a correct return of imports and exports, but the enormous extent of the trade with which it is connected may be approximately estimated from the amount of shipping. It has steadily grown, with one or two slight fluctuations, for over twenty years past.

1. The total tonnage entering and clearing during the year 1904 amounted to 24,754,042 tons, being an increase, compared with 1903, of 714,180 tons, and the highest tonnage yet recorded.

There were 58,093 arrivals of 12,388,892 tons, and 58,099 departures of 12,365,150 tons.

Of British ocean-going tonnage 3,862,802 tons entered, and 3,845,932 tons cleared.

Of British river steamers 2,849,896 tons entered, and 2,847,464 tons cleared.

Of foreign ocean-going tonnage 2,679,908 tons entered, and 2,670,539 tons cleared.

Of foreign river steamers 235,144 tons entered, and 235,227 tons cleared.

Of steam launches trading to ports outside the colony, 52,892 tons entered, and 52,892 tons cleared.

Of junks in foreign trade 1,524,874 tons entered, and 1,547,396 tons cleared.

Of junks in local trade 1,183,376 tons entered, and 1,165,300 tons cleared.

2. Seven thousand, four hundred and thirty-five steamers, 26 sailing vessels, 1,027 steam launches, and 18,100 junks in foreign trade, entered during the year, giving a daily average of 70, as against 68 in 1903.

For European constructed vessels the daily average would be 20.36, as against 19.9 in 1903.

3. For vessels under the British flag, this table shows an increase of 1,741 ships of 2,155,798 tons, an increase of 352 ships of 930,300 tons to ocean-going, and an increase of 1,389 ships of 1,225,498 tons to river trade.

The above increase in ocean-going is principally due to a large influx of colliers and other tramp steamers in ballast, attracted to the Far East by the Russo-Japanese War.

The increase in river trade is due to the fact that 10 new vessels began to ply during the year.
Under foreign flags the table shows a decrease of 1,308 ships of 1,946,897 tons, of which 1,149 ships of 1,910,889 tons are ocean-going; the remainder, 159 ships, measuring 36,008 tons, which shows an increased tonnage, are river steamers.

The decrease in ocean-going is due to the disappearance of all Russians, and almost all Japanese ships from the run since the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War; to a large number of small German and Norwegian vessels being transferred to the Japanese coast trade; and to a considerable decrease in number (but increase in tonnage) of vessels under U.S. colours.

The decrease in river trade is due to the smaller number of individual vessels plying, while the increased tonnage is accounted for by the larger size of those left.

4. The actual number of ships of European construction (exclusive of river steamers and steam launches) entering the port during 1904 was 885, of which 509 were British and 376 foreign. These 885 ships entered 4,007 times, giving a total tonnage entered of 6,543,710 tons. Thus, compared with 1903, 144 more ships entered 12 times less, and gave a total tonnage decreased by 466,471 tons.

Docks.

Hong Kong is well provided with dock accommodation. There are five docks and three slips, which are well equipped with shears, engineer's and carpenter's shops, foundries, and every requirement for making repairs to large ships of war and merchant vessels. The Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock Company was aided by two loans from the British Government in 1864 and 1885, under the Colonial Docks Act. The dock accommodation is being largely increased in order to keep pace with the growing size of ocean steamers.

Currency and Banking.

The currency of Hong Kong consists of the following coins (vide Order in Council, 2nd Feb., 1896):

1. The silver dollar of Mexico.
2. British dollar.
3. The Hong Kong dollar, half dollar, and 20-cent, 10-cent, and 5-cent pieces, issued from the Hong Kong Mint (1866-68).
4. Half-dollars, 20-, 10-, and 5-cent pieces, imported from England, and coined at the Royal Mint and Birmingham Mint.
5. Copper coins representing one-hundredth part of the dollar (called one cent), and one-thousandth part of the dollar (mil or cash), imported from England.

There were issued from the Hong Kong Mint 2,108,064 dollars and 58,587 half-dollars; and 20-, 10-, and 5-cent pieces to the nominal value of $402,671. There have been obtained from England, and put into circulation up to 31st Dec., 1904, subsidiary coins (which now include half-dollars) to the nominal value of $42,518,245.

The coins issued from the Hong Kong Mint are never met with in the Colony now, and of the coins imported from England it is estimated that not more than 10 per cent. remain in the Colony.

A scheme was approved in 1903, for the payment of the higher and non-clerical officers in sterling, to be converted into dollars locally, according to a monthly average rate of exchange. Existing higher officers had the option of adopting the new scale, while those who preferred to retain their dollar salaries continue to draw exchange compensation, i.e., an allowance in dollars sufficient to make up the difference between the exchange value of the dollar and a dollar equal to 3s., with certain privileged rates for drawing leave salary and pension at home.

There are six principal banks (Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China, Mercantile Bank of India, Ltd., China, Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, National Bank of China, the Yokohama Specie Bank, and the International Banking Corporation), having a note circulation of $17,126,244 on 31st July, 1905. There is no savings bank under Government control, but one conducted by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank. The Comptoir National d'Escompte de Paris has an agency in the Colony.

Local weights and measures are the following:

1 tael = 14 oz.; 1 picul = 133½ lbs. (avoirdupois); 1,000 Chinese cash = 1 dollar.

Means of Communication.

There is telegraphic communication with nearly the whole world by a cable to Shanghai (and thence to Japan and Russia) and three cables to Singapore, via (1) Saigon, (2) Saigon, Hué, Haiphong, Hainan, (3) Labuan; and there is very extensive steam communication with Europe, America, and Australia.

In addition to the regular mail lines of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, the Norddeutscher Lloyd and the Messageries Maritimes, which convey the European mails fortnightly, the Pacific Mail Steam Navigation Company have a fortnightly service via Yokohama, Japan, to San Francisco, the Great Northern Steamer Company have a monthly service via Yokohama, Japan, to Seattle, and the Eastern and Australian Steamer Company and the China Navigation Company have a frequent service to the Australian Colonies. The Austrian Lloyd steamers go to and from Europe monthly, and the Canadian Pacific Mail Company have a three-weekly service to Europe via Vancouver and the Canadian Pacific Railway; also the Portland Line of steamers have a monthly service to Portland, Oregon, touching at Japanese ports, and Victoria, British Columbia. All the Nippon Yusen Kaiha vessels to and from Europe and Australia call. There are also The Glen and Blue Funnel Lines, and many small steamers engaged in the China Coast trade which have their base at Hong Kong. Letters from England reach Hong Kong in 28 days.

There is daily steam communication between Hong Kong, Macao, Canton, and the West River. The communication with Japan is three or four times a week. There are no railways (but a cable tramway from the city to the higher levels was opened in 1888, and another is contemplated); an electric tramway on the overhead trolley system from Shaukiwan to Kennedy Town, along the whole extent of the city, was completed and opened in July, 1904. No internal telegraph communication exists except for police and military purposes.* The island possesses few

*There are telegraph lines connected with the Gap Rock and Cape d'Aguilar Lighthouses, in connection with the signalling of ships, &c.
roads available for vehicular traffic except in the town of Victoria. A road has been constructed to complete the circuit of the island. The usual means of conveyance outside Victoria is by boat, chair, and 'ricksha'. There are good roads in Kowloon, and a new road from Kowloon ferry now runs to Tai Po Hú on an arm of Mirs Bay. The rates of postage are as follows:

Letters per ½ oz.
Hong Kong, Canton, and Macao . . . 2 cents
United Kingdom, India, certain Colonies* and British Agencies in China . . . 4 "
Europe, America, and Australasia . . . 10 "
South Africa . . . 20 "

In November, 1902, a Parcels Post Convention was signed between Hong Kong and the U.S.A., which came into force 1st January, 1904. Cheap rate for parcels 35 cents per lb. (limit of weight, 4lbs. 6ozs.). The postal agencies in China at Canton, Swatow, Amoy, Foochow, Ningpo, Hankow, Hoilow, Chafou, and at Liu-Kung-Tau, Wei-hai-Wei, are under the superintendence of the Postmaster-General at Hong Kong. There is a branch office at Shanghai.

Education.

The Government schools include Queen's College, a secondary boys' school, with an average attendance of 1,000 mostly Chinese; the Kowloon British School, a gift to the Colony from a Chinese resident, exclusively for children of both sexes of European-British parentage, with an average attendance of 55; the Victoria British School, recently opened for children of both sexes of European-British parentage, with an attendance of 40; the Belliose Public School, for both sexes, with an average attendance of 85; and 4 Anglo-Chinese District Schools, with an average attendance of 236. Others are being established. All the above schools have staffs wholly or partly composed of European teachers. There are also Vernacular Boys' Schools, under Chinese masters, and 1 Vernacular Girls' School, with a total average attendance of 223. Scholarships have been founded by Government and by private individuals for higher education. There is a Police School and a College of Medicine for Chinese.

Besides Government schools there are a number of denominational schools, under the management of representatives of various religious societies, which receive grants from the Government, and which are subject to Government inspection. The average attendance in these schools was 3,306 in 1904.

Revenue.

About one-third of the revenue is derived from the Opium Monopoly and one-fifth from municipal rates for police, lighting, water and other purposes; 13 per cent. on the annual value in Victoria and the Hill Districts; 12½ per cent. at Yau-ma-ti, Kowloon Point, and Hung-Hom; and rates varying from 7 per cent. to 9 per cent. in the outlying villages, payable by the owners. The annual rates payable on the valuation for 1905-6 are $1,331,895, an increase of $75,110 over those of previous valuation. The remainder is derived from licences, land revenue, stamps, and fees. Land Sales are expected to realize $400,000 in 1906, Stamp Revenue to reach $580,000, and Postal Revenue $410,000. The Revenue has been steadily growing for years, and a total of over $7,300,000 is expected to be raised during 1906.

Defence.

There is an Imperial garrison of about 4,000 men, towards the cost of which the Colony contributes 20 per cent. of the public revenue annually. There is a Volunteer Corps, consisting of two companies of Garrison Artillery and one company of Engineers and a Mounted Troop, with a membership of about 270. The Troop, which numbers about 30, has recently been formed for purposes of scouting and orderly duty in time of war. A Volunteer Reserve Association has also been formed, members of which are required to make themselves proficient in rifle shooting, and undertake to enrol under the Volunteer Ordinance in the event of hostilities. The association has a membership of about 180. The port is the headquarters of the China Squadron (38 vessels in all), which combines with the East Indies and Australian Squadrons to form the Eastern Fleet. There is usually one war vessel present besides the Station Receiving Ship. Land batteries have been erected with a view to protecting the town and anchorage. There is an armed police, 993 strong in 1904, of whom 133 were Europeans, 375 Indians, and 485 Chinese.

Constitution.

The Government is administered under Letters Patent of 19th January, 1888, by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council, composed of six official and two unofficial members, besides the Governor. The Legislative Council is presided over by the Governor, and is composed of seven official and six unofficial members, three of whom are nominated by the Crown on the recommendation of the Governor (two being usually Chinese), one is nominated by the Justices of the Peace from their body, and one by the Chamber of Commerce. The unofficial members vacate their seats after six years from date of appointment. The "Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890," regulates the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in Admiralty cases. The English Common Law forms the basis of the legal system, modified by Colonial Ordinances, of which a revised edition to 1901 has been issued. The law as to civil procedure was codified by Ordinance No. 3 of 1901.
