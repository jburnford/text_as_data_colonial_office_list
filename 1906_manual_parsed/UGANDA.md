UGANDA.

The British Protectorate over Uganda was proclaimed on June 19th, 1894, in succession to a brief administration by the Imperial British East Africa Company. The Protectorate was further extended over Unyoro and Busoga on July 3rd, 1896. By numerous subsequent treaties concluded by various officers in the service of the Protectorate, the British administration has spread still further over countries adjoining the kingdom of Uganda proper, and the boundaries of the Protectorate may now be set forth more or less as follows:

On the east the Uganda Protectorate is bounded by British East Africa as far north as the 6th degree of north latitude, and as far south as the Anglo-Germany boundary; on the south, by the Anglo-Germany boundary and by the 1st degree of south latitude; on the west, by the frontier of
the Congo Free State; and on the north, by an
undetermined line between Lado on the White
Nile and the watershed of Lake Rudolph; on
the north, in fact, it is conterminous with the south-
ward extension of the Egyptian Sudan.

For administrative purposes the Protectorate
is divided into five provinces (Rudolph, Central,
Nile, Western, and Kingdom of Uganda), and
then again into numerous districts. The King or
"Kabaka" of Uganda proper is accorded the title
of "His Highness," and his position and rights
are regulated by treaty.

During the first years of the British Pro-
tectorate an armed force was created from the
remains of the Sudanese army of Emin Pasha.
To these other recruits were added from the
districts of the White Nile, and the force thus
organised, together with irregular bands of friendly
Baganda, was used to repel the hostile attacks of
the King of Unyoro, and later of Mwanga, King
of Uganda. Later on an Indian contingent,
similar to that employed in East Africa and in
British Central Africa, was established. Un-
fortunately discontent arose amongst a section of
the Sudanese force. These Sudanese broke into
open mutiny at the end of 1897, and Mwanga, who
had escaped to German territory, returned to
Uganda and joined the mutineers and Kabarega,
rebel King of Unyoro, in December, 1897. The
Baganda, however, remained loyal, and after a
year's fighting, with some loss in British officers,
the mutiny was thoroughly quelled, and Mwanga
and Kabarega were captured and sent as prisoners
to Kismayu. In 1901 (Mwanga died May 8th,
1903) they were transferred to Seychelles, where
they and a number of followers are maintained
at the expense of the Uganda Government.
Since the early part of 1899 the country has
been perfectly peaceful, and has made considerable
progress in commerce.

Uganda itself is separated by about 800 miles
from the east coast of Africa, but the north-
easternmost extremity of Victoria Nyanza Lake
is not distant more than 580 miles. Over this
stretch of country, all of which lies within the
British East Africa Protectorate, transport was
formerly exceedingly difficult, owing to the paucity
of inhabitants to act as porters, and stretches of
country unhealthy for beasts of burden. Con-
sequently the Imperial Government resolved in
1895 to construct a railway from Mombasa to the
north-east corner of Lake Victoria Nyanza. This
railway, at the end of 1901, had reached and
descended the Kikuyu escarpment, traversed the
Great Rift Valley, ascended the slopes of the Mau
range to within a short distance from the summit,
descended thence the Nyando Valley, and finally
covered the whole 584 miles separating Mombasa
from Port Florence on Victoria Nyanza, which is
the terminus of the railway. The gross expenditure
to 31st March, 1903, was £5,384,370. (about £9,500.
per mile). The traffic earnings (excluding railway
stores) were, in 1901, £80,797., and the working
expenditure £78,891.; and from January, 1902, to
March, 1903, £115,313., and £25,574., respectively;
but £148,148. was incurred in carrying construction
trains and material. Uganda is now in tele-
graphic communication with Mombasa by a land
line, and thence by cable with Great Britain
and other countries. A telegraph line has been
constructed to Butiaba on the Lake Albert
Nyanza, and to Masinde, in Unyoro, and to
Wadelai, which it is proposed to connect with
Nimule, and eventually to meet the Sudan wire
at Gondokoro.

The trade of Uganda is beginning to make a
decided increase, and the railway brings numerous
European and Indian settlers and merchants. The
principal articles of commerce at the present time
are ivory, cattle, wild coffee, india-rubber, cotton,
chillies, fibres, hides and skins, sim-sim and
ground nuts. The country is, however, as a
whole, extremely rich in most African commercial
products, and trade already reaches an annual
value of about £217,112. The local revenue for
1904-5 was £59,707., and the expenditure about
£173,039.

The grant-in-aid for 1903-4 was £130,000.,
and for 1904-5, £139,850.

The estimated population is:—

| Europeans, males | 399 |
| --- | --- |
| ,, females | 85 |
| Asiatics | 500 |
| Africans | 3,500,000 |

Total: 3,500,984
