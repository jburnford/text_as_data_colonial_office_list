FIJI.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of Fiji comprises all islands, rocks, and reefs lying between latitude 15° and 22° S. and between longitude 177° W. and 175° E. It is distant from Sydney about 1,900 miles, and from Auckland 1,200 miles. The Tongan or Friendly Islands lie 180 miles to the south-east, and Samoa 500 miles to the north-east. The French colony of New Caledonia lies to the westward about 700 miles. The number of islands has been variously stated at from 200 to 250; but this includes mere uninhabited rocks and islets.

The dependency of Rotumah consists of all islands, rocks, reefs between 12° and 15° S., and between 175° and 180° E.

The principal inhabited islands are Viti Levu, 4,112 square miles, Vanua Levu, 2,432 square miles, Tavuni, 217 square miles, Kadavu, 124 square miles, Koro, 58 square miles, Gau, 45 square miles, and Ovalau, 43 square miles. The total area of the Colony (including Rotumah, 14 square miles) is 7,435 square miles (about equal to Wales).

Physical Features.

The more important islands are hilly and mountainous, rising more or less abruptly from the shore to a height of about 4,000 or even 4,500 feet. The hills are generally of a grand and picturesque outline, being composed for the most part of old volcanic lavas. Upon the south-eastern or windward sides the islands are covered with dense forests. The lowerlands are more lightly timbered, and apparently have all been under cultivation at a not distant period when the native population was much larger. The soil is almost everywhere deep, easily worked, and especially rich in humic acid. The northern and north-western sides of the larger island, or leeward sides, are characterised by a comparative absence of forest lands. The hills or plains are covered with long reeds or grass, and dotted with clumps of Casuarina and Pandanus.
Iron ore is found in considerable quantities, but is not worked. There are also traces of gold, silver (chloride), antimony, manganese, and other metals.

The country is well watered. Frequent rains keep alive the sources of the thousands of small affluents feeding the main rivers. Of these rivers the Rewa stands first. It is navigable for boats, punts, or flat-bottomed steamers, for 40 or 50 miles from its mouth. Several large streams fall into it, the sources of which lie in the high mountains of the interior 3,000 or 4,000 feet above the level of the sea. Besides these, the Sigatoka, the Nadi, and Ba rivers, with many others, drain the principal watersheds of Viti Levu. In Vanua Levu the rivers are not so large, though they are nearly as numerous. Almost every valley in the group has its stream or brook, from which the native occupants irrigate their plantations of "dalo" (Calocasia esculenta).

Fiji is as rich in harbours and roadsteads as it is in rivers. Each island is surrounded by a barrier reef, and, with few exceptions, is accessible through passages usually found opposite to the most considerable valley or river. Between this river and the shore ships lie safely at anchor, protected by an indestructible natural breakwater.

Rotumah.

The Island of Rotumah, situated in 12° 30' S. lat., 177° 10' E. long., was discovered by the Pandora, in 1793, when searching for the mutineers of the Bounty. Lying to the north-west from two to four miles from the shore, are three small islets, Hattana, Hofiau and Waya. Of these only the last named is inhabited, and it contains but one small village. In 1879 the three principal Rotumah chiefs offered the islands to Great Britain, and they were annexed 13th May, 1881. The population was found at the census of 1891 to number 2,230, of whom two-thirds are Wesleyans, and the remainder Roman Catholics. The principal island is seven miles long by three mile broad, and contains about 9,000 acres. The staple export is copra, of which about 300 tons is shipped annually.

The distance of Rotumah from the seat of government, the infrequency of intercommunication, and the fact that the natives differ entirely from Fijians in language and in polity, necessitate a government on other lines than that of the colony generally. A European commissioner resides on the island, and is, under the governor, the chief executive and judicial authority in Rotumah. The commissioner's court, except in capital cases, takes the place of the supreme court of Fiji. There are two native stipendiary magistrates, who have jurisdiction in minor cases. The island is divided into seven districts, over each of which a chief, appointed by the governor, rules. The framing of local laws is entrusted to the Rotumah Regulation Board (consisting of the resident commissioner, the chiefs, and magistrates). Their enactments are subject to the approval of the legislative council of Fiji. The post of resident commissioner has now been amalgamated with that of provincial medical officer, and a hospital has been established on the island.

Population.

The aboriginal population of Fiji belongs to the darker of the two great Polynesian families, but, living on the confines of the fairer race, its blood has received considerable admixture. It was estimated in 1859 at 200,000; in 1868 at 170,000; and in 1871 at 140,000. By the epidemic of measles which occurred in 1875 it was reduced by more than one-fourth. The population of the colony, as ascertained at the census of 1881, 1891, and 1901 respectively, is shown in the following table:

| Estimated Population at 31st December, 1904. |
|---------------------------------------------|
| Males | Females | Total |
|-------|---------|-------|
| 2,459 | 1,586   | 4,045 |
| 2,623 | 1,615   | 4,238 |
| 1,087 | 791     | 1,878 |
| 7,516 | 4,894   | 12,410 |
| 15,098 | 10,783 | 25,881 |
| 17,105 | 11,969 | 29,074 |
| 15,098 | 10,783 | 25,881 |
| 17,105 | 11,969 | 29,074 |

The enumeration of the Fijian population in 1881 was somewhat incorrect, inasmuch as there was then a tendency on the part of the natives to exaggerate the strength and importance of their various divisions. By the time that the census of 1891 came to be made, that tendency had taken a turn in...
the opposite direction, under the impression that
the assessment of taxes would follow the result of
the enumeration. The birth and death returns
furnished during the ten years, and believed to be
fairly accurate, indicate a decrease of about 4,500 in
the native Fijian population. The births among the
native population in 1904 were 3,396, and the deaths
4,238. The birth rate was 39·52, and the death
rate 48·90 per mil. The death rate among native
children was formerly excessive, but it is satis-
factory to note that among infants under one year,
it has fallen from 72 per cent. in 1893 to 30 per
cent. in 1904.

Indian immigration has almost taken the place
of Polynesian immigration, hence the respective
increase and decrease in the population of Indians
and Polynesians.

It has been found that Indian labourers are both
cheaper and more suitable than Polynesians for
work on sugar plantations. The Indian immi-
grant population is now about 25,600.

**History.**

The islands were discovered by Tasman in 1643,
and visited by Captain Cook in 1769. Captain
Bligh, on his memorable voyage in the launch of
the *Bounty*, sighted part of the group in 1789,
and was chased by a canoe from the island of
Waya, in the Yasawa group. Missionaries settled
in Fiji in 1835, and, after a time, met with great
success.

In 1859 Thakombau, the most powerful chief
of Fiji, offered the sovereignty of the islands to
Great Britain. The offer was declined by the
Duke of Newcastle in 1862. About that time the
demand for cotton, owing to the American civil war,
led to an influx of Europeans into Fiji for the pur-
pose of cotton cultivation. In June, 1871, certain
Englishmen set up a Fijian Government, with the
principal chief, Thakombau, as king. A constitution
was agreed upon, and a Parliament elected. The
Parliament and the Government before long drifted
into mutual hostility, and the Ministry latterly
governed without the aid of the Parliament.

The question of annexing Fiji had been
agitated both in Australia and England since 1869
on many grounds, and in August, 1873, the Earl of
Kimberley commissioned Commodore Goodenough,
commanding the squadron on the station, and
Mr. E. L. Layard, Her Majesty's Consul in Fiji, to
investigate and report on the matter. These Com-
missioners, on the 21st of March, 1874, reported an
offer of the cession of the sovereignty of the islands
from the chiefs, with the assent of the Europeans,
but on certain terms which were not acceptable,
and Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor
of New South Wales, was despatched to Fiji
in September, 1874, to negotiate. This mission
was completely successful, and the sovereignty
of the islands was ceded to Her Majesty by
Thakombau, Maafu, and the other principal chiefs,
in a deed of cession dated the 10th day of October,
1874. A charter was shortly afterwards issued by
Her Majesty, erecting the islands into a separate
colony, and providing for their government.

**Climate.**

The climate of Fiji is cool for the tropics, and
the country is remarkably free from zymotic and
endemic diseases. Dysentery is the only disease to
which Europeans are peculiarly liable. Paludal
fevers have never been met with.

The highest shade temperature at Suva in 1904
was 91°8' in January, and the lowest 59°8' in June.
The total rainfall during the year was, at Suva,
81·09 inches. There is great variety of temperature
and climate to be found in the group. The rainfall
extends over the whole year, but April to October
is the driest period. Between December and April
is the hurricane season.

**Constitution.**

The constitution is regulated by Letters Patent
of 21st March, 1904. The Executive Council
consists of the Governor and four official members.
The Legislative Council consists of the Governor
and ten official, six elected members and two native
members. To the natives a large share of self-
government has been conceded. Their system of
village and district councils has been recognised
and improved, and supplemented by an occasional
meeting of the high chiefs and representatives
from each province, presided over by the Governor.
The regulations recommended by these bodies
have, however, to receive the sanction of the
Legislative Council before acquiring the force
of law.

Levuoka, in the island of Ovalau, with a popula-
tion of 450 souls, was at first selected as the
European capital, but during the year 1882 the
seat of government was transferred to Suva, on
the south coast of the island of Viti Levu, with a
fine harbour. The white population of Suva and
suburbs numbered 1,073 at the census of 1901.
Both Suva and Levuka are ports of registry, and
had, on 31st December, 1904, 10 vessels registered,
of a total tonnage of 567 tons. During the year
1904 seagoing certificates were issued by the
Marine Board to 190 vessels, of a total tonnage of
2,167; of these 74 were owned by Europeans
(tonnage 1,128), and 116 by natives (tonnage 1,039).

A portion of the revenue, varying from 14,000£.
to 16,000£. net, is raised from taxation of the
natives, as follows:

The Colony is divided into seventeen provinces,
each under the control of a European Commissioner
or a Roko Tui (chief native officer). Each province
is sub-divided into districts, of which the head
officers are termed Bulis. Once every year the
provinces are severally assessed by the Legislative
Council for a fixed amount of tax, which was till
lately delivered entirely in the form of produce,
but is now, at the discretion of the Governor, paid
in some cases in money. The produce contributed
consists of sugar-cane, copra, tobacco, yangona
(*Micropiper methysticum*), maize, bêche-de-mer,
and occasionally green fruit and yams.

Sugar-cane is disposed of to the sugar mills under
contracts which are generally entered into for a
term of years. Copra (the principal item in which
native taxes are paid) is sold by public tender
annually, the contractor agreeing to give a fixed
price per ton for all that is received.

Tobacco, maize, and other products are sold by
tender or by public auction, as the quantity from
time to time contributed and the state of the
market will allow or renders expedient.

The Provincial Council, consisting of the Bulis,
presided over by the Roko, distributes the
provincial tax among the different districts, and
there is then a further sub-division among the different villages by district councils, each presided over by its Bulli. The amount and kind of produce paid by each province and district is recorded, and should the total value in any case exceed the amount of assessment the surplus is returned in the form of money. The amount thus returned in 1904 was £11,322.

Local Government.

A municipality was established in 1877 in Levuka, and in 1882 one was established in Suva, on the transfer of the seat of government. These boards are at present regulated by Ordinance No. 16 of 1883. The governing body in each town is elected by the ratepayers. Rates are collected on land and house property. General rates are limited to one shilling in the pound on the assessed value of rateable property; but special rates not exceeding one shilling in the pound are further provided for.

A grant-in-aid not exceeding one-fifth of the sum raised by general rate in the preceding year may be paid from general revenue to any town board.

The revenue and expenditure in 1904 were:

| Revenue | Expenditure |
|---------|-------------|
| £ s. d. | £ s. d.     |
| Suva town board | 2,247 9 4 | 2,808 12 10 |
| Levuka | 1,450 14 9 | 2,041 13 4 |
| Suva school board | 1,099 11 2 | 1,309 1 1 |
| Levuka | 606 4 0 | 693 17 3 |

Total ... ... 5,403 19 3 6,853 4 6

Total receipts of local authorities, 5,403l. 19s. 3d.; total expenditure, 6,853l. 4s. 6d. in addition to the revenue and expenditure of the native local districts above referred to.

Education.

The Public Education Ordinance, 1890, provides for the election of separate school boards within the constituted districts (at present only Suva and Levuka are so constituted). The expenses of the boards are to be paid out of the "School Fund" of each district, consisting (1) Of an annual grant on the average attendance on a scale fixed by the Governor in Council; and (2) Of a contribution from the rating authorities of the amount required for school purposes beyond the Government grant.

Education is free to children within the school districts between six and fourteen years of age. A fee is charged to children not residing within the school district, or who are under or above the school age. The ordinary subjects of an English education are taught, and fees are charged for tuition in special subjects.

There are two common schools under these school boards, one in Suva, with 151 scholars, and one in Levuka, with 97 scholars on the roll.

There is also a Roman Catholic school for Europeans in Levuka (attendance 65), and two in Suva, with an attendance of 118.

The Wesleyan and Roman Catholic missions provide entirely for the education of the natives throughout the group. The former have 1,328 schools, with 2,580 native teachers, and 21,222 scholars.

The latter have 161 schools, with 1,880 scholars.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency, and the only coin in circulation, is British sterling.

The Bank of New Zealand has two branches in Fiji—at Suva and Levuka, and the Bank of New South Wales one branch at Suva.

Provision is made by Ordinance for the establishment of a Government savings bank. There is no Government note issue.

Industries.

The trade and commerce of the Colony depends for its existence on three staple industries, viz., (1) the cultivation, manufacture, and export of sugar; and (2) of copra (the dried kernel of the coconut); and (3) the growth and export of fruit, principally bananas and pineapples.

The principal exports at the date of the annexation of the Colony were copra, cotton (Sea Island), and maize, but the export of maize was soon displaced by that of sugar. Cotton continued to be the third export in point of value until the year 1882, after which it gradually subsided until the year 1888, when only 3½ tons were exported. In the meantime the fruit trade with the neighbouring Australasian colonies had arisen, after the establishment, through Government subsidy, of regular steam communication with Sydney and Auckland.

The export of fruit consists almost entirely of bananas and pineapples, but there is a small export of oranges, limes, lemons, citrons, grenadillas, and perhaps mangoes and guavas, which might well be extended.

The following table will illustrate the course of the trade in the three staple exports of the Colony:

| Year | Sugar | Fruit | Copra |
|------|-------|-------|-------|
|      | Quantity | Value | Quantity | Value |
| 1875 | 96 tons | £3,417 | 97 tons | £3,871 |
| 1880 | 503 tons | £20,920 | 6,216 tons | £7,319 |
| 1890 | 15,291 tons | £244,685 | 67,563 tons | £4,657 |
| 1900 | 32,961 tons | £385,981 | 28,112 tons | £15,605 |
| 1901 | 31,751 tons | £380,155 | 23,715 tons | £10,620 |
| 1902 | 36,995 tons | £406,001 | 25,226 tons | £10,983 |
| 1903 | 40,438 tons | £406,318 | 32,162 tons | £8,529 |
| 1904 | 52,188 tons | £469,391 | 22,102 tons | £7,729 |

The other principal exports in 1904 consisted of:—Bêche-de-mer, 16 tons, valued at £1,384l.; tobacco, 13 tons, valued at £1,477l.; turtle-shell, 14 cwts., valued at £1,344l.; vanilla, 23 cwts., valued at £1,046l.; peanuts, 28 tons, valued at £515l.

Minor exports consist of gum, molasses, wool, yams, tea, cocoanuts.

The growth of rice has been commenced, and the cultivation of sugar cane is being considerably extended.

About 90 per cent. of the trade of the Colony is with the Australian colonies and New Zealand, and the export of sugar to Canada is somewhat rapidly increasing. There is no direct communication with the United Kingdom, and all trade between Fiji and Great Britain consequently passes through the Australian colonies.

Means of Communication.

The number of letters, newspapers, and book packets received and despatched by the Post Office

There is regular steam communication with the following places outside the Colony: Sydney (5 to 8 days), three or four times a month; Auckland (4 days), direct every four weeks, and via Samoa and Tonga every four weeks. Many extra steamers run during the sugar season. In addition to this, Suva is a port of call for the Canadian-Australian Royal Mail Line of Steamers which ply between Vancouver and Sydney via Honolulu, Suva, and Brisbane.

Postage to the United Kingdom, India, the Australian States, and certain Colonies* is 1d. per ½ oz. To other countries in the Postal Union 2½d. per ½ oz.

Internal postal rates: 1d. per ¼ oz.; newspapers ½d. A Parcels Post with the United Kingdom was established in June, 1890. The rate of postage is one shilling for the first 1 lb., and eightpence per lb. thereafter. There is also a parcels post with the Australian States, New Zealand, and Canada. The rate of postage is eightpence for the first 1 lb. and sixpence per lb. thereafter.

The Colony entered the Postal Union on 1st September, 1891.

Letters from England sent via Sydney reach Fiji in about fifty days, letters via San Francisco, or Vancouver, in about 31 days.

There is a telephone from Suva to Lautoka, a distance of 125 miles, which is maintained by the Colonial Government, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and the Union Steamship Company jointly. There is a telegraph line between Suva and Levuka, a distance of 43 miles.

There is no railway in the Colony. Suva is now connected by Pacific Cable with Brisbane, via Norfolk Island, and with Canada, via Fanning Island. Intercommunication within the group is maintained by sailing boats and steam launches, and by an inter-island steamer. A few good roads have been constructed on the larger islands, and more are in process of construction.
