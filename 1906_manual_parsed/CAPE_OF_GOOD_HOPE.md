CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.

Extent and Boundaries.

The Cape of Good Hope, strictly speaking, is a small promontory near the south-west extremity of the continent of Africa. But the extensive Colony of the name is bounded by the Atlantic and the Southern or Indian Oceans on the west and south; it is bounded on the north to the west of longitude 22° by the Orange River, and on the north-east by the Orange River Colony and Natal. The Cape Colony, with the Transkei, contains an area of 276,995 square miles, being over five times that of England. It extends from 26 to 35 deg. S. lat., and from 17 to 30 deg. E. long.

In 1844 Letters Patent were issued annexing Natal to the Cape, but in 1856 it was constituted a separate Colony.

Twelve islands off Angra Pequena, on the coast of Damaraland (Plum-pudding, Roast-beef, Holland's Bird, Mercury, Ichaboe, Seal, Penguin, Halifax, Long, Possession, Albatross, and Mona), with the adjacent rocks, were annexed in 1867, and added to the Cape Colony in 1874.

In 1876, three large tracts of Kaffraria—namely, Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve, and Noman's Land, were brought under the more direct control of Government, and on the 12th of June, 1876, Letters Patent were issued authorising the Governor to annex these territories to the Cape of Good Hope, on condition of the Cape Parliament passing an Act to provide for their government. Such an Act was passed as No. 38 of 1877, but the territories were not actually incorporated until the 1st of October, 1879.

On the 12th March, 1878, the Port of Walfish Bay, situated a few miles north of the tropic of Capricorn, was proclaimed British territory. It was annexed to the Colony by proclamation dated 7th August, 1884.

On the 15th October, 1880, the Province of Griqualand West was incorporated with the Cape Colony.

Under Proclamation No. 13 of the 26th January, 1882, were issued certain laws and regulations for the government of the territories known respectively as Tembuland, Emigrant Tambookieland, Bomvanaland, and Gcalekaland, of which, by royal warrant dated the 14th November, 1881, the officer administering the government of the Cape of Good Hope was appointed Governor. By proclamation No. 140 of 26th August, 1885, issued under Act 3 of 1885, these territories were annexed to the Cape Colony. A similar warrant was passed on the 27th July, 1881, in respect to the St. John's River Territory, which was annexed to the Colony by Proclamation No. 215 of the 15th September, 1884.

The Xesibe country ("Mount Ayllif") was annexed to the Colony by Letters Patent of the 23rd August and Proclamation of 25th October, 1886, and the Rode Valley, Pondoland, by Letters Patent of 29th July, 1887, and Proclamation of October, 1887 (Act No. 45 of 1887). Under Act No. 5 of 1894 the whole of Pondoland was annexed, Basutoland, now an independent Colony, formed part of the Cape from 1871 to 1884.

On the 16th of November, 1895, British Bechuanaland was incorporated with the Cape under Law No. 41 of 1895.

History.

On 14th September, 1486, Bartholomew de Diaz, a Portuguese commander, landed in Algoa Bay. Vasco de Gama doubled the Cape 11 years later,
from which time it appears to have been resorted to by European navigators of all nations, but chiefly by Portuguese, Dutch, and English. British ships visited the Cape in 1591, and about 1602 the Dutch made it a place of call. In 1620 two English East India commanders, by a proclamation dated from Saldanha Bay, took possession of the Cape in the name of Great Britain; but no settlement was formed. In 1648 a Dutch East India man, the Haarlem, was wrecked in Table Bay, the crew remaining there some time. In 1652 J. A. Van Riebeek, duly commissioned by the "Chamber of Seventeen" at Amsterdam, landed at Table Bay accompanied by 100 persons, and took possession of what is now the site of Cape Town on behalf of the Dutch East India Company. In 1671 the first formal purchase of land was made from the Hottentots, and another purchase took place the following year. At the time of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the European population received a slight addition of French Protestants, but their descendants have not maintained any distinctive position in the country. The rule of the Dutch East India Company proved very distasteful to the burghers, who were continually prompted to move further and further from the seaboard and original seat of colonisation. Following these migratory colonists, a magistracy was established at Swellendam in 1745, and another at Graaff Reinet in 1786, and in 1788 the Great Fish River was proclaimed the boundary of the Colony. In 1795, Holland having yielded to the French Revolutionary Government, an English force proceeded to the Cape of Good Hope to secure it against the French for the Prince of Orange, but the Governor refused to obey the mandate of the Prince, and the British force thereupon proceeded to take possession, upon which a capitulation was arranged, and the administration of the Government was assumed by General Craig. An Act of Parliament (37 Geo. III., c. II.) was passed to regulate the trade with the new possession. By the Peace of Amiens the Cape of Good Hope was restored to the Batavian Republic, and evacuated in 1803, but it was again captured by a British Force in 1806, and at the General Peace of 1814 it was ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown. During the interval between the Peace of Amiens and the recapture by the British in 1806, the Colony had made rapid progress, owing to the abolition of the rule of the Dutch East India Company, and the wise regulations of government which had been substituted. An important event in the history of the Cape was the expulsion in 1809 of the Kaffirs from the Zuurveldt, a district west of the Great Fish River. In 1817 that district was visited by the then Governor, who saw the importance of its colonisation as a barrier against the Kaffir power, and in 1820 Parliament voted a sum of £50,000 to promote emigration to the Cape, and 4,000 British immigrants were brought to the Colony and settled in the eastern districts. In December, 1834, began the first of what are called the Kaffir wars, when the Gaika tribe, 20,000 strong, overran the whole south-eastern portion of the Colony, but were defeated, and their lands up to the Kei River proclaimed British territory, but Lord Glenelg, then Secretary of State, refused to ratify the annexation. In 1846 the second Kaffir war broke out, but was speedily suppressed, and the colonial border was extended to the Kei River, as proposed by Sir Benjamin D'Urban. On Christmas Day, 1850, began the third Kaffir war, which lasted nearly three years, and in its earlier stages was aggravated by a simultaneous rebellion of the Kat River Hottentots.

In 1836 began what is called the trekking of a part of the Dutch or Boer population. This remarkable movement, which resulted in the colonisation of Natal, the Free State, and the Transvaal, may be ascribed to several causes, of which the chief were: (1.) General dislike of the policy of Great Britain in relation to slavery and the Native question. (2.) Particular resentment against the policy of Lord Glenelg in reversing the policy of Sir Benjamin D'Urban in relation to the first Kaffir war. (3.) Resentment against the mode in which compensation had been made to them for the loss of their slaves under the Imperial Act abolishing slavery, namely, by orders for payment payable in London, which they could only dispose of on the spot at an enormous discount.

The years 1849 and 1850 were years of continued excitement, owing to the proposals of the Government at home to send convicts to the Cape. In view of the agitation, carried almost to the point of active resistance, the project was abandoned. In 1856 the German Legion, which had been formed during the Crimean war, was brought to the Cape, and the men, numbering 2,300, disposed in selected spots on the frontier for defensive purposes. The same year (1856) was remarkable for the prevalence in Native Kaffraria of a cattle-killing delusion, preached by a young prophetess, which resulted in wide-spread starvation. The political changes which have occurred in the last 20 years are briefly described under the title Constitution. One of the most important events in the recent economical and social history of the Cape has been the discovery of diamonds beyond the Orange River, which is described under the title of Diamonds.

Climate.

The climate of the Cape is very favourable to Europeans. The air is dry and bracing, the heat seldom oppressive, and the winter weather mild and delightful; snow or ice are unknown except in the more elevated localities. The mean temperature at Royal Observatory, near Cape Town, is—maximum 70°9, minimum 53°4, and average rainfall for the last 15 years 26°66 inches. Aliwal N. (4,330 ft. above sea) shows 74°0 and 44°1 max. and min. resp., rainfall average for 15 years 23°31 inches.

In the Eastern and Midland divisions the chief rainfall is during the summer months (November to April), in the Western districts during the winter months.

The Cape offers many localities presenting the requisites of altitude and extreme dryness for the modern treatment of consumptive patients.

Cape Government Railways.

The railways of the Cape Colony were originally commenced by private enterprise at Cape Town, and when, in 1873, the lines were taken over by the Government, only 63 miles were open. New construction was then undertaken in the shape of three separate systems, starting from the principal seaports of the Colony, viz., Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and East London.

In 1885, 1,569 miles had been opened for traffic, and for a period of some three years there was a suspension of further work, though the necessity of making progress towards the establishing of through communication within the Colony, and the securing of the trade of the inland States to the north of the Colony was constantly kept in view.
Consequently, on the discovery of the Gold Fields in the Transvaal abnormal development in railway construction ensued, and the same is now, and has been, observable in respect to the rapid extension of the railways in Rhodesia.

In December, 1904, the Cape Government railways consisted of 2,664 miles of line, divided into three systems, known as Western, Midland and Eastern.

(1.) The Western System, starting from Cape Town, extends to Vryburg, a distance of 774 miles.

The following branch lines form part of the Western System:—Wynberg and Simon's Town (20 miles), serving the populous suburbs of Cape Town and watering places in its vicinity; Malmesbury, Eende Kuil line (110 miles), which leaves the Main Line at Kraaifontein Junction. From Kalabas Kraal on this line there is a 2 feet gauge line to Hopefield via Darling, a distance of about 47 miles. These two branches serve a very important grain-producing centre. On the main line there are alternative routes between Durban Road and Mulder's Vlei, one of which (the branch, 26 miles) serves the Stellenbosch district. At Eerste River on the Stellenbosch line there is a branch to Sir Lowry's Pass and Caledon (66 miles), which serves a rich agricultural district.

Another branch leaves the Main Line at Paarl and runs through a fertile district to French Hoek (via Simondium) a distance of 17 miles.

The new Cape Central Railway (about 147 miles), a private line constructed under a Government subsidy, runs from Worcester to Swellendam and Riversdale, and serves several productive agricultural districts.

Parliament authorised by Act 38 of 1902 the expenditure of an amount of £114,000 as a subsidy at the rate of £2,000 per mile for 57 miles to any company or person obtaining Legislative authority to construct a line of railway from Riversdale to Mossel Bay. The construction of this line is being carried on by the New Cape Central Railway Company, Limited, and it is expected that it will be opened for traffic at an early date.

The Cape Flats and Suburban Railway Syndicate constructed a short line of railway from Maitland, where it joins the main line of the Cape Government railways, to Ottery Road on the Cape Flats, a distance of 7 miles. This line was opened for traffic on the 1st February, 1904, and until the 31st May, 1904, was worked by the Cape Government Railways on behalf of the syndicate; but since the latter date the line is being worked by the Government at its own risk for a period of 2 years. Parliament authorised by Act 14 of 1904 the extension of the Cape Flats line to Diep River, a distance of about 3½ miles from the present terminus at Ottery Road, but work has not yet been commenced on this extension.

A short line, four miles in length, was built by the Milnerton Estates Company, Limited, from Craig's Crossing, which is situated between Woodstock and Salt River stations, to the Milnerton estates. This branch is worked by the Government on behalf of the Milnerton Estates Company.

The Cape Government railways end at Wynburg, where the lines of the Rhodesia Railways, Limited, commence. The length of line between Vryburg and Bulawayo (Bulawayo exclusive), 588 miles, is worked by the Cape Government Railway Department for the owning company at actual cost, and from Bulawayo northwards the lines are worked by the Beira and Mashonaland Railways.

Railway extension in Rhodesia has been progressing rapidly within the last few years; from Bulawayo there is now through communication to Gwelo, Salisbury, Beira, and the Victoria Falls (282 miles from Bulawayo and 1,644 miles from Cape Town).

Parliament authorised by Act 38 of 1902 the construction of the following lines, further to open up the Western districts of the Colony:

- A 2 feet gauge line from Hopefield towards Vredenburg for a distance of 14 miles at a cost of £25,000.
- A 2 feet gauge line from Ceres Road station to Ceres (10½ miles) at a cost of £44,167.
- A 2 feet gauge line from Victoria West Road (Hutchinson) station to Carnarvon (77½ miles) at a cost of £184,916.
- A 3 feet 6 inch gauge line from De Aar, via Britstown, to Prieska (111 miles) at a cost of £427,350.

Construction on the Hopefield-Vredenburg and Ceres Road-Ceres line has not yet been commenced.

The Carnarvon line is being built as a 3 feet 6 inch gauge line, in terms of Acts 29 of 1904 and 44 of 1905. The line was opened for traffic as far as Pampoepoort (48 miles) on the 1st May, 1905, and construction work on the section between Pampoepoort and Victoria West is proceeding.

The De Aar-Prieska Line was formerly opened for traffic on the 1st April, 1905, as far as Omdraais Vlei (73 miles), and on the 9th June, 1905, the section from Omdraais Vlei to within a mile of Prieska was opened, under construction, for the conveyance of goods and passenger traffic.

By Act No. 29 of 1904 Parliament authorised the construction of a line of railway from a point of junction with the Cape Government railways at or about Fourteen Streams to the border of the Transvaal, a distance of about four miles. This line forms a connection with a new line which is being built from Klerksdorp to the Transvaal border, and will thus make the route from the Cape to Johannesburg shorter and more direct. The total length of the line from Fourteen Streams to Klerksdorp is about 144 miles. Construction work is progressing favourably, 36 miles of rails having been laid from the Fourteen Streams end and 26 miles from the Klerksdorp end.

Per Act No. 44 of 1905, provision was made for the expropriation, reconstruction and equipment of the line of railway, 3½ miles in length, commonly known as the Sea Point Railway, which was authorised by Act No. 23 of 1889 to be constructed by the Metropolitan and Suburban Railway Company, Limited. In terms of the Act of 1905 the Municipal Council of Green and Sea Point has entered into an agreement with the Government guaranteeing and securing the repayment to the Government, for a period of ten years from the date on which the railway is opened for traffic, of any loss in working, interest on capital, etc.

The Government has taken possession of this line and the work of re-construction has been commenced.

Act 44 of 1905 also authorises the construction of a line of railway from a point at or near Somerset West or Strand Halt to Somerset West Strand, a distance of about 2½ miles, at a cost of £14,276., and the Municipal Council of Somerset West Strand has entered into obligation in regard to the making good of any loss which may be incurred in working the line similar to those which have been entered into by the Green and Sea Point Municipality.
Work on this line has been commenced.

Provision was also made in Act 44 of 1905 for £84,150 for the construction of a line of railway from Mafeking to Ottoshoop in the Transvaal, a distance of 22 miles, in order to cater for the trade of the Western Transvaal. In accordance with the terms of this Act negotiations are being conducted with the Government of the Transvaal with the view of entering into a convention providing for the construction, equipment, working and maintenance of the portion of the line which shall lie within the Transvaal Colony.

(2.) The Midland system starts from Port Elizabeth and joins the Western system at De Aar (339 miles). From Naauwpoort Junction (270 miles) the trunk line to the Orange River Colony and the Transvaal is continued.

The lines through the Orange River Colony (then Orange Free State) were built by the Cape Government Railways under convention with the Orange Free State, in terms of which the Cape constructed and worked the lines and the Orange Free State drew a moiety of the profits. On the 1st January, 1897, the Orange Free State Government took over these lines from the Cape and established its own railway department for the working of the lines in that territory.

In addition to the trunk line of the Midland system there is a line branching off at Zwart-kops, which touches Uitenhage and Graaff-Reinet and re-joins the main line at Rosmead Junction, after running a distance of 276 miles. This line passes through agricultural and fruit-growing country. From Klipplaat (123 miles from Port Elizabeth) on the Uitenhage-Graaff-Reinet line there is a branch to Oudtshoorn of 154 miles, through some of the most productive districts in the Colony.

Another branch line belonging to the Midland system is that from Alice Dale to Graham's Town (35 miles). This line is continued to Port Alfred (a seaside resort for the surrounding districts) by a railway owned by the Kowie Railway Company, Limited. This private branch is 43 miles in length, and was constructed under subsidy from the Government.

A junction line, 83 miles long, with the Eastern system (No. 3) at present exists from Rosmead Junction (243 miles from Port Elizabeth) to Stormberg Junction (326 miles from Port Elizabeth and 221 from East London); this line forms part of the Midland system. From a point—Bamboo Junction—on this line there is a branch about 16 miles in length, which serves the Cape Collieries and other companies' coal mines with railway communication. By Act 38 of 1902 the Government authorised the expenditure of the sum of £30,000 for the purpose of extending this line from its present terminus to Romansfontein, a distance of eight miles, but, up to the present (August, 1905), construction work on this Branch has not been commenced.

Another junction line further south, through agricultural and stock-producing districts having a large native population, was undertaken some years ago by a private corporation, under a contract with the Government, providing for the payment of a subsidy, but, after several vicissitudes, arrangements were made for the line to be built as a Government line. The line runs from Somerset East to Cookhouse (on the main line of the Midland system), and on, via Fort Beaufort, to King William's Town (on the Eastern system), thus forming another connection between the Midland and Eastern systems, and considerably shortening the journey by rail between Port Elizabeth and East London. The total length of this line is 152 miles and the last section was opened for traffic on the 17th October, 1904.

In Act 29 of 1904 provision was made by Parliament for the construction of a line from the seaport of Mossel Bay, lying between Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, to George (33 miles) at a cost not exceeding £353,231. Fifteen miles of rails at the Mossel Bay end have already been laid in connection with a line Mossel Bay to Oudtshoorn, which was being built under subsidy but which has since been taken over by the Government, but it is proposed to construct this line only as far as George in the meantime, Oudtshoorn being already connected by rail from the Port Elizabeth end.

In 1898 Parliament authorised the construction of a narrow-gauge line from a point at or near Port Elizabeth to Avontuur, a distance of 179 miles. This line and the Hopefield line on the Western system are a new departure in Cape Government railway construction and working, as they are light railways of 2 feet gauge instead of the standard gauge of 3 feet 6 inches. The experiment will be watched with much interest. The section of the line Humewood Road to Kabeljaws (55 miles) has been completed for the running of construction trains, conveying goods and passengers, and goods traffic is being conveyed between Kabeljaws and Humansdorp (71 miles).

Per Act 16 of 1904 Parliament authorised the construction by the South-Western Railway Company, Limited, of a 2 feet gauge line from Knysna to a point near Yzernek in the district of Knysna, a distance of about 16½ miles. In terms of this Act the Company is being granted a subsidy by the Government calculated at the rate of £80 per mile.

Construction work has been commenced on this line.

(3) The Eastern system starting from East London was originally constructed to Aliwal North (280 miles) lying on the south bank of the Orange River, the boundary between the Cape Colony and the Orange River Colony.

In 1891 a junction with the trunk lines through the Orange Free State towards the Transvaal was effected by a connecting line from a point 33 miles south of Aliwal North to Springfontein, in the Orange Free State (314 miles from East London).

As before stated, through communication between the Eastern, Midland and Western districts exists, and a junction line further south has been constructed from Cookhouse to King William's Town (152 miles), thus forming another connection between the Midland and Eastern systems.

There is a branch line from Blaney to King William's Town (10 miles), an old-established centre, and formerly a military station of some magnitude, and a branch line (66 miles) connects Sterkstroom with the Indwe Coal Mines.

There is also a light line of standard gauge between Bowker's Park and Tarkastad, a distance of 22 miles.

Surveys have been made through the fertile and generally densely populated native districts of the Transkei and East Griqualand, with a view to future railway connection with the sister colony of Natal.

Parliament authorised by Act 38 of 1902 the construction of the following lines, which will further open up the eastern districts of the Colony:

A 3 feet 6 inch gauge line from a point at or near Amabele loop to Butterworth, towards Umtata, a distance of 78 miles, at a cost of £619,045.
A 3 feet 6 inch gauge line from Indwe to Maclear, towards Kokstad, for a distance of 107 miles, at a cost of £96,901.

A 2 feet gauge line from Aliwal North to Gairtney (47 miles), towards Barkly East, at a cost of £48,849.

Construction on the Amabele-Butterworth and Indwe-Maclear railways is proceeding favourably. The former was opened for traffic to Inciba (East Kei, 45 miles) on the 15th April, 1905, and the latter was opened as far as Elliott (50 miles) on the 18th May, 1905.

The Aliwal North-Gairtney line is being built as a 3 feet 6 inch gauge line as far as the funds voted by Parliament will allow, in accordance with Act 29 of 1904, and on the 19th June, 1905, it was opened as far as Lady Grey (40 miles) for the conveyance of goods by construction trains.

Parliament, per Act 48 of 1905, authorised the construction by a company styled "The St. Johns-Kokstad Railway Company, Limited," of a line of railway of the standard gauge from a point adjacent to the Umzimvubu River at the port of St. Johns to Kokstad. This line, which is 142 miles in length, is subsidized by the Government, the subsidy authorised being calculated at the rate of £1,500 per mile.

Parliament, per Act No. 49 of 1905, also authorised the construction by a company styled "The St. Johns-Umtata Railway Company, Limited," of a line of railway 76 miles in length from a point upon the proposed St. Johns-Kokstad Railway (authorised by Act 48 of 1905) at Isenuka to Umtata. The line authorised is of the standard gauge, and a subsidy will be paid by the Government in respect thereof, calculated at the rate of £1,500 per mile. These two lines, when completed, will open up the native districts of Pondoland and the Transkei.

On the 31st December, 1904, the mileage of the Cape Government Railways open for traffic was 2,664, and the length authorised and under construction on that date was 606 miles. The gross receipts for the twelve months ended December 31st, 1904, were £4,144,319, compared with £5,329,868 for the year 1903; the working expenses were £3,719,822, compared with £4,522,590 for the year 1903, resulting in a return of £1,118,897 per cent. on capital expended as compared with £1,48,947 per cent. for the previous year.

Through railway communication now exists between all the Government lines of the Cape Colony to Bulawayo, Wanki, Victoria Falls and Salisbury in Rhodesia; to Beira in Portuguese East Africa; to Bloemfontein, Johannesburg, Pretoria and Pietersburg on the Central South African Railways; and, via Germiston (Transvaal), to Durban and other important centres in Natal, and Delagoa Bay in the Portuguese territory.

The existing colonial lines, in common with all South African lines (save the private line, 92 miles in length, owned and worked by the Copper Mining Company in Namaqualand, isolated from any Government line, which has a gauge of 2 feet 6 inches, and the 2 feet gauge lines referred to herein), are constructed on a gauge of 3 feet 6 inches. The lines are well and substantially laid, and both the rate of speed and their general comfort and equipment are admittedly creditable. Especial attention is devoted to the peculiar requirements of long journeys and the variations of climate experienced. Corridor saloons, carefully constructed with a view to comfort and stability, are provided on the through trains. They are fitted with lavatory accommodation and electric light, while the provision of bedding at reasonable charges adds materially to the comfort of the passengers.

At the present time (August, 1905) the following trains are run from Cape Town for the conveyance of passengers to the Transvaal and Orange River Colony:

First class, train de luxe only, with dining car, on Fridays. First and second class only, with dining car, on Mondays and Wednesdays. First, second and third class, without dining car, daily.

For the convenience of passengers arriving by the mail steamer from England who wish to proceed to their destination immediately on arrival of the steamer at Cape Town, a train (the "Royal Mail"), with first class accommodation only, leaves the docks every Tuesday morning, or on arrival of the steamer, conveying passengers and mails for the Midland and Eastern systems of the Colony and for stations in the Orange River Colony and Transvaal.

Oversea passengers intending to take advantage of this train require to notify their intention to do so to the Union-Castle Mail Steamship Company prior to the steamer leaving Madeira. Friends of passengers who meet them on arrival of the steamer at Cape Town, and who wish to accompany them to their destination, may travel by the "Royal Mail," provided they give 24 hours' notice to the station master at Cape Town of their intention to make use of the train. There is a dining car on this train, and passengers are supplied with meals on board at a fixed tariff and with refreshments at moderate charges.

There is a daily train conveying passengers to all systems on the Cape Government Railways.

There is also a train de luxe (the property of the Rhodesia Railways) which conveys first and second class passengers to Bulawayo, leaving Cape Town on Wednesdays, and returning to Cape Town on Tuesdays, thus enabling passengers for the outward mail-boat, leaving Table Bay on Wednesdays to spend a day in Cape Town prior to their departure.

Since the 1st of August, 1903, prior to which the catering on the Cape Government Railways was put up for tender, the supplying of refreshments to passengers at various stations along the line, and also the catering on the trains, have been performed by the department, and, judging from the many complimentary letters which have been received, and the absence of serious complaint, the departmental catering has been a success.

Owing, however, to the decision of Parliament that the department should not enter into competition with licensed victuallers, and to the closing of the refreshment bars at Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and East London, a loss has, up to the present, been incurred in the working of this department.

On all through trains the services of efficient conductors are provided, the men being selected for approved qualities. Their duties are especially to attend to the requirements of passengers, and the system has been found to work most satisfactorily.

The character of the country traversed near the coast is greatly diversified on each system, though when the higher altitudes are reached the general characteristics are usually similar. On the Western and Midland systems the scenery is perhaps the more imposing, while on the former line the vast stretches of the dry Karroo region, apparently barren and parched throughout a great portion of the year, are not without a certain charm of their own.
After rains the great latent fertility of the Karroo region is apparent, for, within a marvellously short space of time, the whole face of the country becomes carpeted with flowers of brilliant hue, which, with the bright crispness of the atmosphere, add greatly to the enjoyment of the traveller.

The Eastern line through much of its length traverses an open grassy country, presenting many interesting features.

The Government issues a tariff book, corrected quarterly by the railway authorities, containing full information upon all matters likely to be of interest or service to the public, such as fares, rates, distances, etc.

Harbours.

Harbour works on an extensive scale have been constructed at Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and East London, under the direction of local boards, composed of elective and nominee members.

The expenditure upon construction of works at Table Bay to the 31st December, 1904, has been £3,931,191, and the annual charges for interest and maintenance, including working, are respectively about £103,410 and £47,602.

The shipping accommodation consists of an outer harbour, formed in part by the breakwater, and a south arm running parallel with it, enclosing an area of 64 acres, which, with the inner basin, makes a total area of 72½ acres, with a depth ranging from 24 to 36 feet at low water.

Many of the quays are equipped with the most modern appliances for handling cargo, such as electric cranes and capstans; and commodious warehouses are erected in various parts of the Dock. The normal capacity of these works is 8,000 tons per diem.

Further shipping accommodation is being provided by the construction of a quay wall over 3,000 feet long; and the foreshore between the root of the South Arm and the Central Jetty is being reclaimed, upon which it is proposed to erect warehouses, etc.

The Breakwater is completed to a length of 3,640 feet, and is to be extended by 1,000 feet.

The graving dock is 500 feet on the keel blocks, with a depth of 24½ feet over the cill at entrance at H.W.O.S.T.

The patent slip is capable of taking up vessels of 1,000 tons.

The administration of the harbour of Port Elizabeth is in the hands of a Board of seven Commissioners, two elected by residents paying 10/- a year wharfage, one nominated by the Chamber of Commerce, three by the Government, and the Mayor being a member ex-officio.

The whole of the landing and shipping operations are carried out by the Board departmentally.

The works at Port Elizabeth consist of two jetties, 1,160 feet long, which cost £260,000, and a third jetty, which is now being extended to 1,460 feet in length. When completed, the cost of this last-mentioned jetty will be £185,000.

In addition to the above, there is an explosives jetty, 1,380 feet from the shore, with an aerial ropeway communication. This ropeway is capable of landing 150 tons per day.

There is also a slipway capable of accommodating vessels of 400 tons dead weight.

The Board has an electrical plant, with an output of 236 kilowatts, put down for lighting and power purposes.

The Board's hydraulic plant consists of three pumping engines of 200 horse-power, each working 25 wharf cranes, 6 capstans, 4 wool hoists, and a pump for street watering. The number of cranes is now being increased to 31.

The total storage area of the Board's warehouses is about 35,000 square yards.

At East London, at the mouth of the Buffalo River, successful harbour works have been carried out, overcoming the obstruction of sand-bars, which previously to a great extent closed the mouth of the river. The entrance to the river is now protected and sheltered by a solid south breakwater and improved by means of two training walls. The depth of water about the entrance is maintained by three steam pump-hopper dredgers of the latest type. A least depth of water over the bar of about 19 feet at low water ordinary spring tides is available throughout the year. The width between training walls at entrance to river is 250 feet. Steamers of over 8,000 tons gross register now enter the river and discharge cargo alongside wharves. The harbour is well equipped with steam and hydraulic cranes, with a lifting capacity from 2½ up to 50 tons, and possesses a patent slip capable of accommodating vessels up to 1,000 tons dead weight. A new quay on the most up-to-date lines is being constructed on the west bank of the river, and will provide, when finished, the most convenient quay in Africa. The whole of the arrangements on this side are in accordance with the best European models, and cargoes will be landed and despatched with exceptional rapidity—goods being either loaded direct from the ship's hold on to railway trucks or deposited into very spacious sheds. The discharging appliances on this quay will be operated by electricity, and will be of the most modern design. To the 31st December, 1903, there had been spent on works and interest on loans, £1,859,902.

Diamonds.

The diamond fields of South Africa are situated in the territory known as Griqualand West, which became British territory by cession from the Griqua people in 1871, and remained a separate Colony until October, 1880, when it was annexed to the Cape Colony.

The first diamond was found by accident in 1867, and passed through many hands before its value was suspected. Even when it was admitted to be a diamond doubts were thrown on its origin. Nothing like an organised or systematic examination of the country was made for a long time.

A few diamonds, however, continued to be found, and in the year 1870 an exploring party, chiefly composed of officers of the 20th Regiment, then stationed at Natal, and another of Cape Colonists from King William's Town, proceeded to dig and wash the alluvial drift along the banks of the Vaal River. They soon found diamonds, and their success brought numerous other parties from all parts of the neighbouring Colonies and Republics. Operations were at this time confined to the river banks, which for many miles were covered with mining camps.

In 1871, however, the discovery was made that diamonds existed not only in the drift of the old river-bed near the present course of the Vaal, but in the loose red surface-sand covering the flat grassy country between that river and the Modder, a smaller stream which ultimately joins the Vaal. A vigorous, if not systematic, search soon resulted in the opening of the mines now being worked at and close to Kimberley, and the river banks were soon almost deserted for the more
profitable Dry Diggings, where diamonds were found in unexampled profusion.

The River Diggings extend along the Vaal River, principally on the right bank from above Hebron to its junction with the Hart at Delport's Hope. The Dry Mines at present worked are at Kimberley, De Beers, Du Toit's Pan, Bultfontein, Premier Mine (Wesselton), Kamfer's Dam, Otto's Kopje, the Leicester Mine, Smith's Prospect Mine, Otto's Prospect Mine. The alluvial diggings at present worked commence at Fourteen Streams, extending principally on the north bank of Vaal River to Delport's Hope, in the Division of Barkly West; and opposite Hebron, and on the south bank, lie the Wedburg Kopje and the Robinson Diggings, in the Division of Kimberley; also on the south bank, below the village of Barkly and in the Division of Barkly West, lie the Waldeck Plant Diggings, Niekerk Rush and Vaal River Estates.

In October, 1899, an Act was promulgated (No. 11 of 1899) to consolidate and amend the laws relating to the prospecting and mining for precious stones in the Colony.

The following tables give the total quantity and value of the production and export of diamonds during the past five years:

| Production |
|------------|
| 1900. | 1901. | 1902. | 1903. | 1904. |
| Carats. | Carats. | Carats. | Carats. | Carats. |

Other Minerals, &c.

Cape coal from various mines situated in the Stormbergens is extensively used upon the Cape Government railways, with good results, both as regards the working of the lines and the development of an industry, the importance of which to the Colony cannot be overrated.

In the neighbourhood of the Indwe, trending in a north-east direction, are considerable tracts of Crown land as yet untested, but reported by mining and geological experts to be in all probability the seat of valuable deposits of coal. It has been suggested that these beds may be connected with those found on the north-west border of Natal.

Mining operations on a large scale are carried on in the division of Namaqualand, where extensive copper deposits exist. Much activity has recently been displayed in this direction owing to the increased demand for copper in manufactures.

The output from the mines during 1903 was 64,555 tons of ore, and in 1904, 84,199 tons.

During the year 1897 a series of thorough comparative tests was made by the Railway Department of all coals (Welsh, Cape Colonial, Orange Free State and Transvaal) used by the Cape Locomotive Department. Of the mines which supplied the different samples of coal thus tested, twelve were situated in Cape Colony. The trials were carried out on the Eastern System of Railways between East London and Queenstown.

The results obtained showed that the value of a given quantity of the best Cape coal, for use in locomotive or stationary engines, was, roughly speaking, about two-thirds that of an equal quantity of imported ocean Merthyr coal. Among the best Colonial coals for making steam are those from the following mines: Contat's, Penshaw, Indwe, Cape Collieries, and "Wallsend." The Indwe coal possesses the advantage, as regards its use in locomotives, of containing little or no sulphur. The Cyphergat and the Molteno coals are highly bituminous, and the latter has a deservedly high reputation as house coal, but is not so suitable for locomotives as coal of a semi-anthracite nature, like "Wallsend."

The Indwe mine, which is situated in the division of Wodehouse, is connected with the Government railways by a line joining the Eastern system at Sterkstroom. All the other mines in the Colony are served by the Eastern system. The total output from the Colonial mines during the year 1904 is returned at 172,785 tons. The coal areas in the Colony are of considerable extent, and there is reason to hope that, with increased facilities in mining and transport, the output will improve in quantity and quality.

The laws regulating the working of baser minerals are Acts Nos. 9 of 1877 and 15 of 1883, under which regulations are published by G.N. 633 of 1900.

Precious Minerals.

Gold.

The Millwood Gold Fields, in the Division of Knysna, are the only proclaimed gold fields in the Colony, and the total registered output to the 31st August, 1905, is 3,862 ozs. 1 dwt. 14 grs.

In January, 1899, an Act (No. 31 of 1898) was promulgated to consolidate and amend the laws relating to the prospecting and mining for precious minerals in the Cape Colony, subsequently amended by Act 45 of 1905.

Geological Survey.

A geological survey of the Colony was begun in 1896. The area mapped extends from the west coast south of Zout River, Van Rhyn's Dorp, to a line drawn between Storms River and Willowmore. A map of part of this area was published with the Report for 1897, and the rest will appear after the survey of the south-western quarter of the Colony is completed. Considerable areas have been mapped outside the south-western districts, in the divisions of Hope Town, Prieska, Kentani, Barkly East, Herschel, Xalanga, Wodehouse, Elliot, Aliwal North, Queenstown, Glen Grey, Uitenhage, Humansdorp, Alexandria, and Matatiele, and maps of some of these divisions have been published in the Reports for 1901, 1902, 1903 and 1904.

Industries.

The chief industries are the production of wool, wine, wheat, barley, oats, tobacco, lucerne and maize, and the breeding of horses, mules, cattle, goats, sheep and ostriches. The chief exports are diamonds, wool, copper ore, ostrich feathers, mohair, hides and skins. The chief imports are textiles, leather, sugar, coffee, wheat, flour, oils, tobacco, wine, whisky, timber, hardware and machinery.

The quantity of wine produced in the Colony during 1904 amounted to 5,686,672 gallons, spirits to 1,534,069½ gallons, and vinegar to 113,862½ gallons, practically all consumed locally.

Ostrich breeding is carried on largely as heretofore, but farmers are now devoting more attention to the quality of the feathers in their breeding birds than in former years.

In 1860 the export of ostrich feathers was 2,287 lbs.; ten years later it was 28,768 lbs., while in 1904 it amounted to 470,381 lbs., valued at 1,058,988£.

The exports of mohair at corresponding dates were respectively:—385 lbs., 403,153 lbs., and 14,038,780 lbs., valued at 613,358£. The export of wool has risen from 23,172,786 lbs. in 1860, to 48,822,562 lbs. in 1871, and stood at 64,372,270 lbs. in 1904, valued at 1,794,333£.

The export of wool and mohair for 1904 shows a marked decrease on that of 1902. This is due to the drought which for the last few years has prevailed in the greater portion of the Colony. The high price of slaughter stock has induced the farmers to turn their attention more to cross-breeding for the production of mutton, and this also has had some influence in the decreased export of wool.

The Agricultural Department, which was established in 1887, has, by the consent of Parliament, been placed under a separate Minister. Amongst the more important works which are being carried out are the reconstitution of phylloxerised vineyards by means of the French-American resistant stocks, and the encouragement of mule-breeding by the importation by the Government of Spanish jackasses. Large areas of the Colony are peculiarly adapted for the breeding of mules as the nature of the veldt renders any other feeding unnecessary. The industry has been largely taken up in these areas and many farmers are importing jackasses for this purpose. In horse-breeding also there has been renewed activity, the practice of former years, viz., crossing the Colonial mares with English thoroughbred stallions, having been largely reverted to, and, on account of the large importation of racing stock, there is no lack of suitable sires in the country.

The Minister for Agriculture, through the Surveyor General, administers all matters connected with the Land Laws of the Colony, Mining Laws, Geological Exploration and Survey; and, through the Director of Agriculture, all matters connected with the Game Laws, stock-breeding, diseases of animals, and plants, viticulture, horticulture, and all other subjects allied to agriculture. A general Scab Act, passed during the session of 1894, came into force in November, 1895, and repealed the then existing permissive Acts. An amending Act was passed during the session of 1899.

The Minister for Agriculture also administers, through the Chief Clerk, the Crown Forests of the Colony, Fisheries, and the Government Guano Islands.

Lands.

Those desiring to acquire Crown Lands in the Cape Colony must now either compete at public auction at the sales of surveyed lands held under Act 15 of 1887 from time to time as occasion seems to demand in the various districts of the Colony, or they must apply for certain specified areas or farms which have been set aside for selection under Act 37 of 1882 or Act 40 of 1895.

Both these Acts were designed to enable sons of the soil without means, such as the sons of farmers, to obtain land without necessitating the investment of capital, and they require the applicant to select and name the piece of ground he requires; and if his request be entertained, a licence for five years is issued at a rental calculated at 5 per cent. on the capitalised assessed value of the land. Upon the termination of the licence and fulfilment of the conditions respecting occupation and (in the case of Act 37 of 1882) cultivation, the licensee is entitled to a title deed under Act 37 of 1882 on quit-rent tenure under Act 40 of 1895, on payment of the purchase price in instalments extending over 15 years, the balance of unpaid instalments and the survey expenses being secured by a mortgage in favour of the Government.

Act 37 of 1882 deals with small holdings, not larger than 250 morgen, and is suitable for districts in the vicinity of markets where la petite culture may be carried on profitably, but Act 40 of 1895 is rather applicable to cattle or sheep runs of 3,000 to 6,000 morgen in extent, and is most suitable for pastoral districts.

Under Act 15 of 1887, farms in extent varying from the cattle ranch to the market garden or town building lot are surveyed by the Government, and advertised for sale from time to time to the highest bidder at an upset price. The price is assessed at the current market value in the district, and is of course subject to enhancement by competition, but the terms of payment are very easy, one-fifth of the price at which the land is sold being payable within the first 12 months—viz., one-tenth within 6 months and one-tenth within 12 months, and the remainder being secured by a first mortgage at 4 per cent. The balance of the purchase price may, if the purchaser desires it, be paid at once, or in portions of not less than £50 at a time. In case.
however, the purchase price is less than £25; the whole amount must be paid in cash at once, or in equal instalments extending over 3 years, and bearing interest at 4 per cent. per annum from the date of sale.

Forests.

The total area under forest in the Cape Colony is approximately 518,000 acres. The attention of the Government has been given to the economical and systematic working of the Crown Forests. The Colony is divided into four Conservancies, each controlled by a Conservator of Forests, stationed at Cape Town, King William's Town, Knysna and Umtata respectively, who are directly responsible to the Chief Conservator of Forests for the Colony. The present annual importation of timber into the Colony is about 5,000,000 cubic feet, mostly pine, derived from Europe and America, the balance being hardwood from Australia. There is at present a large importation of hardwood sleepers.

The Fishery and Game Laws are also administered by the department, and in connection with the former a properly-equipped steam trawler, the Pieter Faure, was imported in 1897 with a view to opening up the Fishing Industry of the Colony. The work has been extended to Saldanha Bay, Mossel Bay, the L'Agulhas Bank, and portions of the south-east coast, and has been of a most satisfactory nature, the trials made having proved that large quantities of fish are easily procurable by trawling. Private enterprise has now followed the prospecting work of the Government, and a trawler company is sending fish to Cape Town from the L'Agulhas Bank near Mossel Bay. Two trawlers from Grimsby are landing weekly about 20 tons of fish, including numerous soles from the trawling ground discovered near Cape L'Agulhas; several trawlers working from Durban, East London, and Port Elizabeth, are working the new trawling area found near Bird Islands. The trout acclimatisation work is still being carried on with a most gratifying measure of success, and some of the rivers have now been opened for public fishing.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is British sterling, and this is also the money of account.

Since the beginning of 1892, the banks having their head offices outside the Colony are only allowed to issue notes supplied to them by the Government, which holds securities deposited by the institution for the total supply of such notes given to the banks. The notes are legal tender and guaranteed by the Government, the banks having to redeem the notes in gold on demand at their chief places of business.

Banks having their head office in the Colony, and having been registered on the 1st January, 1891, can continue to issue their own notes, which are neither guaranteed nor legal tender.

There are 6 banks with 154 branches:—The Standard Bank of South Africa, Limited (97 branches), the Bank of Africa, Limited (25 branches), the African Banking Corporation, Limited (22 branches), the Stellenbosch District Bank, Limited, the National Bank of South Africa, Limited (10 branches), and the Netherlands Bank of South Africa.

The total amount of notes in circulation on the 30th of June, 1905, was 1,159,171l.; legal tender, 1,148,460l.; other, 6,711l.

Education.

Under the Education Act, No. 13 of 1865, and the Higher Education Act, No. 24 of 1874, the Department administers Parliamentary grants to colleges, and to the following classes of schools, viz.:—Undenominational public, district boarding, evening, private farm, poor, mission, aborigines, institutions, art schools, training schools for teachers, and industrial schools for poor whites, for the following purposes, viz.: part payment of salaries, purchase of buildings, furniture, apparatus, and books; training of teachers; support of indigent boarders.

Schools are managed and teachers appointed, subject to the control of the department, by local committees or managers nominated by the voluntary promoters and supporters of the school, or by divisional or municipal councils acting as such managers.

The Government grants are, generally speaking, given to supplement local contributions of at least equal amount. There is no school tax, the necessary grants being provided from the general revenue. The department further undertakes the periodical inspection of schools, collects and publishes educational statistics, and issues certificates of professional competency to teachers.

The School Board Act, No. 35 of 1902, provides for the division of the country into school districts under the control of School Boards elected by the local ratepayers, charged with the supervision of all public and poor schools and empowered to levy, through divisional or municipal councils, a rate for school purposes. The establishment of School Boards will be completed during the year 1905-6.

The Government expenditure on education in 1904-1905 was 446,262l. 11s. 4d. On the 30th of June, 1905, there were in operation five colleges and 2,930 schools of various classes.

The University.

Under Act No. 16 of 1873 was established the University of the Cape of Good Hope, whose power to confer the degrees of B.A., M.A., LL.B., LL.D., M.B., and M.D. has been recognised by Letters Patent dated 8th August, 1877. Chancellor: H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, K.G., K.T., K.P.

Under Act No. 6 of 1896, the University is empowered to confer the following additional degrees:—Lit.D., B.Sc., M.Sc., D.Sc., Bachelor of Music, Master of Music, Doctor of Music.

The University is aided by a Government grant, and its revenue is supplemented by endowment, etc. The Council consists of 33 members.

In 1904 the number of students who matriculated was 564, 95 passed the intermediate examination, and 69 took direct degrees.

In connection with the University, school examinations are held annually, 22,681 candidates have passed the elementary, and 9,225 the higher examination during the years 1875-1904.

Sea and Land Communications.

The packets of the Union-Castle Mail Steamship Company, under contract with the Colonial Government, leave England weekly on Saturdays, and the Cape (Table Bay) on Wednesdays, the passage to be effected in 16 days 15 hours, and in 17 days 9 hours when the steamer is required to touch at St. Helena and Ascension. The distance by sea from England to the Cape varies from...
5,866 to 6,146 miles, according to the course followed. The mail packets call at Madeira on the outward and homeward voyages. The St. Helena-Ascension service is performed by the intermediate steamers of the company, under agreement with the Imperial Post Office.

A mail train leaves Cape Town three times weekly at 8.15 p.m. for Mafeking, and one at 9 p.m. daily, for the Orange River Colony, Transvaal, and Natal, and is extended twice a week to Rhodesia.

In addition to this, a weekly fast mail train leaves Cape Town for Rhodesia on Wednesdays at 11.20 a.m., arriving at Bulawayo on Saturdays at 8.20 a.m. and Victoria Falls 3.15 p.m. Sundays.

On Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, at 10.40 a.m., a limited mail train leaves Cape Town for the Orange River Colony and the Transvaal, reaching Johannesburg in 46 hours 40 minutes.

In the opposite direction, a limited mail train is run from the foregoing, reaching Cape Town at 2.5 p.m. on Wednesdays to connect with the outgoing steamer.

The mail steamers leave Table Bay weekly for Natal, calling at Port Elizabeth and East London, to land and embark passengers, while a weekly service to Port Elizabeth, East London, and Durban, and a fortnightly service to Mossel Bay, is also maintained by the intermediate steamers of the Union-Castle Company. The passage to Port Elizabeth takes two days, to East London three, and to Natal four to five.

A frequent but somewhat irregular service from Cape Town to the Australasian Colonies is maintained by the steamers of the Shaw, Savill, and Albion Company, the New Zealand Shipping Company, the Aberdeen Line, Lund's Blue Anchor Line, the White Star Line, and the German-Australian Steamship Company.

Communication is effected between Cape Town and the chief inland towns daily; with Natal daily, via the Transvaal; with the Orange River Colony daily; with Rhodesia (Mashonaland, &c.) twice a week; and with the Transvaal daily by rail through the Orange River Colony. The latter is the direct route to the Transvaal, and the journey from Cape Town is performed in little more than two days.

Transit between England and Johannesburg and Pretoria by this route is, therefore, about 19 days.

Overland communication is effected by rail between Cape Town and Delagoa Bay daily, through the Orange River Colony and the Transvaal. The journey is performed in four days.

The number of Colonial post offices is 1,013, and of money order offices, 347. The expenditure on the postal service amounted to £36,901, in 1904, the revenue was £40,676, and the commission on money orders, £28,012.

Post Office savings banks were established in 1884. On 31st December, 1904, there was a sum of £2,886,860 deposited to the credit of 98,856 depositors. The interest allowed is 3 per cent. on deposits and 3½ per cent. on certificates. Number of branches, 347.

The telegraph system is well developed, there being now 30,725 miles of telegraph wire, and 4,606 miles of telephone wire open, erected by the Government at a cost of £11,853, the gross earnings in 1904 being £213,673, and the expenditure £282,582. Number of telegraph offices, 547.

The Colony is in telegraphic communication with Europe, via Loanda and Bathurst, and via St. Helena, Ascension, and St. Vincent, by the Western route, and via Natal, by the Zanzibar and Aden cable, and with Australia, via Durban, Mauritius and Cocos.

The weights and measures in use are British; besides which there are the morgen=2½ acres, the Cape foot=1'03 feet, and the Cape ton =2,000 lbs.

Population and Chief Towns.

At the census of 1904 the total population of the Colony was found to be 2,409,804, comprising 1,218,940 males, and 1,190,864 females. The population according to race was: Europeans, 579,741; Malays, 15,682; Hottentots, 91,200; Fingoes, 310,720; Kaffirs, 1,114,067; and other coloured persons, 298,334.

Cape Town, which had in 1891 a population of 51,251, had at the census a population of 77,668, and with its suburbs, connected by rail and tramway, 169,641, as compared with 78,866 in 1891. The Cape division, which includes Cape Town, had, in 1865, a population of 50,064; in 1875, 57,319; in 1891, 97,283; and, in 1904, 213,167, of which 120,475 were European or white.

The population of the other principal towns was: Kimberley, 34,331; Port Elizabeth, 32,959; Beaconfield, 9,378; Grahamstown, 13,887; Paarl, 11,293; King William's Town, 9,506; East London, 25,220; Graaff Reinet, 10,083; Worcester, 7,885; Uitenhage, 12,193; Cradock, 7,762; Oudtshoorn, 8,849; Queenstown, 9,616; Stellenbosch, 4,969; and Somerset East, 5,216.

The following is a brief abstract of the 1904 census returns:

The number of persons of European descent has been estimated as follows:—Dutch and French origin, 230,000; English, Scotch, Irish, etc., 130,000; other Europeans, 16,000.

The European, or white, then, represents one-quarter, and the coloured races three-quarters of the total population of the whole Colony, whereof one-fifth is urban. The proportion of females is now 97·70 to every 100 males of the total population, and the average number of persons to the square mile was 8·70. The number of inhabited dwellings was 450,999, of which 434 were not intended for dwelling-houses, though used as such.

Birthplaces.—2,274,130 persons had Africa for a birthplace, 118,377 Europe, 10,387 Asia, 3,011 America, 3,654 Australasia, 118 were born at sea, and the birthplaces of 127 were unknown or unspecified. 98·38 per cent. of the population are British subjects by birth.

Religions.—Protestants numbered 1,306,453; Catholics, 38,118; Jews, 19,537; Mohammedans, 22,623; other sects, 4,297; no religion, 1,016,255; unspecified, 3,286; and 235 persons objected to state their religion. Protestants may be divided as follows:—Dutch Reformed Church, 399,487; Gereformeerde Kerk, 6,269; English Church, 281,433; Presbyterians, 88,660; Congregationalists, 112,202; Methodists, 290,264; Lutherans, 80,902; Baptists, 14,105; other Protestants, 32,191.

Sickness and Infirmities.—13,844 persons (8,185 males and 5,659 females) were returned as disabled by sickness or accident; and 15,077 (9,528 males and 5,549 females) as afflicted by infirmities, 2,802 being blind, 1,016 deaf and dumb, 829 idiotic, 2,190 lunatic, 579 epileptic, 1,198 paralytic, 1,230 leprous, 5,233 maimed, lamed and deformed.

The population of Bechuanaland, as ascertained at the census of 1904, was: Europeans, 9,368; Malays, 28; Hottentots, 3,331; Fingoes, 1,266; Kaffirs and Bechuanaas, 64,204; mixed and others, 6,276.

The population of Pondoland at the Census of 1904 was 1,113 Europeans, 3 Malays, 130 Hottentots, 13,067 Fingoes, 187,442 Kaffirs and Bechuanaas, and 1,002 mixed and others.

In the Colony proper the European birth rate in 1904 was computed to be 31·81 per 1,000, the Coloured rate at 30·77. The death rate amongst Europeans was 12·61 per 1,000, and the Coloured rate 25·42, during the same year.

Constitution.

The Government of the Cape from 1806 to 1835 was administered by a Governor, aided by a few Executive Officers; but in that year an Executive Council and a Legislative Council, appointed by the Crown, comprising certain office-holders and some unofficial members, were created.

By Letters Patent, dated 23rd May, 1850, the Governor and Council were empowered to enact Ordinances for the establishment of a Representative Government; three years later, that form of Government was brought into force. By an Act of the Colonial Legislature passed in the session of 1872, the introduction of the system of Responsible Government, that is the conduct of the Executive Government by the advice of Ministers responsible to the Local Parliament, was pronounced advisable, and the Royal Assent to the measure was given by an Order in Council dated the 9th August, 1872. The first Ministry under Responsible Government was formed in November, 1872.

There is a Legislative Council of 26 elected Members, presided over, ex officio, by the Chief Justice, and a House of Assembly of 107 elected Members, representing the country districts and towns of the Colony, including the Transkeian territories. The Colonial Ministers are the Prime Minister, the Colonial Secretary, the Treasurer, the Attorney-General, the Commissioner of Public Works, and the Secretary for Agriculture, all of whom are Members of the Legislature and also have seats in the Executive Council, of which the Governor is President. The session lasts usually from March to June.

Act No. 18 of 1874 provided for the division of the Colony into seven electoral provinces, each electing three members for the Legislative Council for seven years. Under the Griqualand West Annexation Act, 39 of 1877, a member is added to the Council for that Province, and one has been since added for Bechuanaland (Act No. 41 of 1895). Under the Additional Parliamentary Representation Act of 1904 an additional member is added to the Council for the Western, South-Eastern and Eastern Electoral Provinces respectively, who are thus now entitled to return 4 members each, and 12 new members were added to the House of Assembly. The qualification for Members is possession of immovable property of 2,000L., or movable property worth 4,000L. With the exception of paid office-holders (other than the Ministers), and others specified in the Order in Council, any person may be elected a Member of Assembly. For the purpose of the House of Assembly elections the Colony is divided into 46 electoral divisions.
Members of both Houses are elected by the same voters, who are qualified (see Ballot and Franchise Act of 1892) by possession of property worth £5l. or receipt of salary or wages of not less than £6l. per annum; but no one can be newly registered as a voter unless he can sign his name and write his address and occupation. The number of registered electors in 1903 was 135,168. The Registration Act, No. 41 of 1887, makes a better provision for the machinery of registration and for the exclusion of unqualified persons, especially those whose only qualification is a share in tribal occupancy, and further provision in the direction of improved machinery is made in the Parliamentary Representation Act, No. 19 of 1898, the Registration of Parliamentary Voters Amendment Act No. 48 of 1899, and in the Parliamentary Indemnity Act, No. 5 of 1902.

Elections are now conducted under the Ballot Act, as amended by Act No. 48 of 1899.

Members of either House are paid one guinea per day, with 15s. per day extra for not more than 90 days if residing over 15 miles from Capetown. Speeches may be made either in English or in Dutch (Law No. 1 of 1882).

By an Act, No. 5 of 1875, the Ecclesiastical Endowments provided by the Civil List Ordinance of 1852 were abolished prospectively, the life interests of incumbents being respected.

The Supreme Court, as consolidated by Act 35 of 1896, consists of one Chief Justice and eight Puisne Judges; three of whom are assigned to the Court of the Eastern Districts, and three to the High Court of Griqualand. Within the jurisdiction of the Court of the Eastern Districts fall the territories known as Transkei, Griqualand, Pondoland and Tembuland.

The Judges of the "Supreme Court" hold sessions in Cape Town, and Circuit Courts in the Western Districts; the Judges of "The Eastern Districts Court," hold sessions in Grahamstown, and Circuit Courts in the principal towns of the Eastern Districts, and Transkei, and the Judges of the High Court hold sessions at Kimberley.

The Roman-Dutch Law prevails in the Colony, as modified by Colonial Legislation. A "Native Territories Penal Code" came into operation for the Transkei, Griqualand East, Tembuland, and Port St. John's on 1st January, 1887.

By Act No. 3 of 1890, the Supreme Court has been constituted a Court of Appeal under the Africa Order in Council of 1889, and a similar arrangement exists for Rhodesia.

Local Government.

Divisional Councils were first established in the year 1855; they then exercised authority over branch roads only, and performed certain functions in connection with district schools, pounds and Crown lands. They have now been relieved of all duties in regard to schools and lands, but with these exceptions their powers and functions have been gradually increased and amplified. The councils are elected triennially, and consist of eight elective members, exclusive of the Civil Commissioner, who is usually also Resident Magistrate, as chairman, excepting in the Cape Division, which returns ten members. The electors are the registered parliamentary voters, and the qualifications of members are registration as voters and registered ownership of immovable property in the division valued at not less than £50l. The maintenance of all roads now rests with the councils, and they also have important duties to discharge in regard to disputed land boundaries and beacons; can nominate Field Cornets; may borrow money on the security of rates for the prosecution of local public works; may promote the establishment of a Divisional Police Force on payment to Government of one-third of the cost of such force; and return three members annually to the District Licensing Court. The revenue of these councils is derived from toll fees, pound sales, and road rates. They were 77 in number in 1905, and their receipts during the year 1903 for those then existing amounted to £210,355. Payments for the same period amounted to £236,524l. The accounts are subject to audit by two auditors elected triennially by the registered voters of the division, and also to a final audit by the Controller and Auditor-General of the Colony.

Municipalities were first established by an Ordinance in 1836. In 1882 an Act was passed consolidating and amending all laws then existing in regard to these boards. Every municipality is governed by a council, composed of a mayor or chairman, and councillors, numbering not less than 6 nor more than 24, a certain number of whom are elected annually by the ratepayers. Certain municipalities are under special Acts, but all Town Councils or municipalities under the General Municipal Act, 1882, have power to levy annually a landlord's or owner's rate, assessed upon the value of rateable property, and a tenant's rate assessed upon the annual value of such property; no rate to exceed 2d. in the £ on the value, or 8d. in the £ on the annual value.

All mayors or chairmen are members of District Licensing Courts. There were 118 municipalities in the Colony, the receipts from all sources during the year 1903 for the municipalities then in existence amounted to £2,097,240l., which includes £949,689l. loans raised. Payments during the same period amounted to £2,028,055l. The Controller and Auditor-General has no general control over municipal accounts.

Village management boards, of which there are 78 in the Colony, exist chiefly in hamlets which are not entrusted with full municipal privileges. The Act of 1881, under which these boards were established, may be proclaimed to be in force upon petition of the inhabitants. There are 3 or 5 members elected annually by the voters registered for Parliamentary purposes, resident within the area defined by proclamation. These boards have no power to levy rates; this is done for them by the divisional council at their request, to an amount not exceeding 3d. in the £ within the limits of the village boards' jurisdiction. The powers and duties of these boards are of the same nature as, although in most respects more restricted than, those of municipalities. Their revenues amounted in 1902-3 to £9,091l., including balances.

Defence.

There is an extensive Admiralty establishment and several forts at Simon's Bay, and to defend this Naval station an Imperial garrison is stationed at Cape Town and Wynberg. The defence of the Colony from native attacks, however, devolves since 1871 upon Colonial forces. These now consist of the Cape Mounted Riflemen (709 strong) and the Cape Mounted Police (1,609 strong), liable in an emergency, which are permanently embodied and paid. There are also 60 Volunteer Corps, and
Cadet Corps, of all arms, numbering 9,113 men (with 18 guns), maintained by a capitation grant. Table Bay has been strongly fortified at the joint expense of the War Office and the Colonial Government.

**Dependent Territories.**

**Basutoland,** which formed a portion of the Cape Colony from August, 1871, down to 1884, is now an independent territory, administered by a Resident Commissioner under the instructions of His Majesty's High Commissioner in South Africa. Accounts of Basutoland, as well as of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, which is in nearly the same political position, will be found under the heading of South Africa.

**The Northern Border.**—Early in 1878, while the war with the Amaxosa was being carried on, a number of Koranas, Griquas, Kaffirs, and others living along the Orange River, took up arms against the Colony, their object being simply plunder. It was difficult to move a military force to such a remote quarter, and it was more than a year before the insurrection could be suppressed. A magistrate, with a body of police, was then stationed at Upington, on the northern bank of the Orange. Since this date there have been no further disturbances. The northern border establishment was broken up, and the Special Commissioner recalled, on 30th June, 1888. The territory now forms the "Gordonia" district of British Bechuanaland, now annexed to Cape Colony (see below).

**Fingoland,** Idutywa Reserve, and Noman's Land, as explained in Par. 1 of this Article, were annexed to the Cape in October, 1879.

In 1877 the Gcalekas, a tribe residing beyond the Kei, under Kreli, one of the leaders of the great Kaffir war of 1850-53, defied the authority of the British Government and invaded what is now British territory. They were, however, defeated by the Colonial forces under the immediate leadership of Col. C. D. Griffith, C.M.G., then Commandant of the Frontier Armed and Mounted Police. Their territory was overrun, and Kreli deposed, and his country taken as British in October, 1877.

In 1875-76 the Tembus, of Tembuland proper, gave themselves over to the Government, and in 1878 the Bomvanas did the same.

While giving effect to the desire of these tribes to come under the Cape Government, it was also arranged to include in the same scheme of incorporation Gcalekaland and a settlement of native British subjects called the Emigrant Tembus.

They are governed by officials paid by the Cape Government, and under its supervision.

The above-named territories, viz., Tembuland, Emigrant Tembuland, Bomvanaland, and Gcalekaland, were formally proclaimed British territory in November, 1881, and in 1885 they were annexed to the Cape Colony.

In 1885, the Chief Kreli requested to be placed on the same footing as the others, and was located in Bomvanaland, on a tract of land purchased from the Chief of the Bomvansa. Palir, chief of the Ametaheri, who had previously been living in practical independence in Lower Tembuland, formally tendered his submission to Colonial rule in 1886, and he and his people were registered in the same manner as the Tembus.

The PondoMisi tribe, under the chiefs Um dishwa and Umhlonho, and some of the most powerful clans, allied with the Tembu tribe, took up arms against the Colony at the outbreak of the Basuto Rebellion. The Tembus proper aided the Colony. The insurrection was suppressed, and a re-settlement of the lands previously occupied by the insurgents effected, by which greater security in the future is promised.

The Cape Colony customs dues are levied at St. John's River mouth, under a Proclamation dated 2nd August, 1881. The port was annexed to the Colony in 1884.

Under a Proclamation of Sir Bartle Frere, dated the 4th September, 1878, Umqikela, for breach of treaty arrangements, ceased to be recognised as paramount chief of the Pondos, and the sovereignty of the port and estuary of St. John's River was vested in Her Majesty's Government. A Resident was appointed to represent the Government with Umqikela, who remained Chief of East Pondoland. Umqikela died in October, 1887; and in February, 1888, his son Sigcau was elected to succeed him. A Resident Commissioner in Pondoland was appointed on 6th July, 1888.

In March, 1894, in consequence of the failure of Sigcau and Nqwiliso to put a stop to the cruelties and misrule prevailing in Pondoland, they were required to submit to Colonial rule, and magistrates were placed in the country. By Act of the Cape Parliament, No. 5 of 1894, the whole country was annexed to the Colony.

**West Pondoland** was, until the date of annexation, under the Chief Nqwiliso. A small strip of his territory at the mouth of the St. John's River was acquired by the Cape Government for £1,000.

The district of Mount Ayliff, or the Xesibe country, after having long been administered as a dependency of Griqualand East, was formally annexed to the Colony in October, 1886, and the Rode Valley in October, 1887.

The whole of these territories are now subject to Colonial rule, and had a revenue of £171,152, in 1903-4. All of this is included in the ordinary Colonial revenue.

They are now re-grouped under one Chief Magistrate, Col. W. E. Stanford, C.M.G., C.B., who also holds office as Secretary to the Native Affairs Department, being stationed at Cape Town, and is assisted locally by Assistant Chief Magistrates at Umtata and Kokstad respectively.

Griqualand East has nine subordinate magistrates. Its population at the Census of 1904 was Europeans, 5,901; Bantu, 212,069; mixed, 4,662.

Tembuland, comprising Tembuland proper, Bomvanaland, Emigrant Tembuland, and East and West Pondoland, has fourteen subordinate magistrates. It has a population of—Europeans, 8,056; Bantu, 221,313; mixed, 1,327.

Transkei, comprising Fingoland, the Idutywa Reserve, Gcalekaland, has six subordinate magistrates. It has a population of—Europeans, 1,707; Bantu, 175,682; mixed, 197.

**British Bechuanaland.**—On the 30th of September, 1885, the territories south of the Molopo river and of the Ramathlakama spruit were declared to be British territory under the name of British Bechuanaland, and a commission was issued to the Governor of the Cape to be its Governor, with power to legislate by proclamation. The territory was annexed to the Cape Colony on the 16th of November, 1895.
