NEW ZEALAND.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of New Zealand consists of three principal islands, called respectively the North, the Middle, and Stewart Islands. There are several small islets (mostly uninhabited) dependent on the colony: the chief of these are the Chatham Isles, 536 miles eastward of Lyttelton, in 43° 45' S. lat., 176° 177° W. long. (Chatham and Pitt are the principal islets); and the Auckland Isles. The main group lies between 33° and 53° S. lat., and 162° E. long. and 173° W. long. The three principal islands extend in length 1,100 miles, but their breadth is extremely variable, ranging from 46 miles to 250 miles, the average being about 140 miles. The area of the North Island is 44,468 square miles, of the Middle Island, 68,525 square miles, of Stewart Island, 665 square miles, and small outlying groups of islands, 1,093 square miles, a total area of 104,751 square miles (twice the size of England).

In April, 1842, by Royal Letters Patent, and again by the Act 26 & 27 Vict., cap. 23, all islands between 162° E. and 173° W. longitude, and 33° and 53° S. latitude, are annexed to New Zealand.

By letters patent, dated 18th January, 1887, the group called the Kermadec Islands, situated about 614 miles N.E. of the Bay of Islands, were annexed to New Zealand. These are a chain of widely separated islets, lying between 29° and 32° S. lat., and 177° and 180° W. long. The principal are Raoul or Sunday, and Macauay, the next in size being Curtis and Esperance. Raoul comprises 12 square miles, is covered with forest, and rises to a height of 1,720 feet.

The Protectorate over the Cook Islands was administered through the Governor of New Zealand until 1900; in October of that year the group was annexed to Her Majesty's Dominions, and resolutions were passed by the New Zealand Parliament for the extension of the boundary of the Colony to include the group as well as Savage Island and other small islands. By proclamation finally fixing the date from which the boundaries of the Colony are deemed to be extended, from the 11th June, 1901, the following islands are included:—Raratonga, Mangaias, Atiu, Aitutaki, Mitiaro, Mauke, Hervey (Manuae), Palmerston (Avaramu), Savage (Niue), Pukapuka (Danger), Rakanga, Manahiki, Penrhyn (Tongareva), and Suvarrow. An account of the Cook Islands is given below.

Climate.

The climate is temperate and very healthy, the death rate being less than 10 per 1,000. The temperature is more equable than in the British Isles. While the summers are as cool as those of England, the winters are as warm as those of Italy. The mean annual temperature at Auckland (59°) is nearly the same as at Rome; at Wellington (56°) nearly the same as at Milan; at Dunedin (51°) nearly the same as at London. The extreme range of temperature at Wellington is 50°, from 82° in summer, to 32° in winter. The rainfall varies from a mean for the year of 25 inches on the east coast, to 112 inches on the west coast of the Middle Island, and from 37 inches on the east coast, to 59 inches on the west coast of the North Island.

The average birth rate for the years 1895–1904 was 26·13 per 1,000 living, and the average death rate for the same period 9·79. The birth rate in 1904 was 26·94 per 1,000; the death rate in that year was 9·57.
History.

New Zealand was discovered in 1642 by the Dutch navigator, Tasman, who, however, did not land upon its shores. In 1769 it was visited by Captain Cook, who in that year, and during subsequent voyages, explored its coasts. The country subsequently became a resort for whalers and traders, chiefly from Australia, as well as a field for the labours of the Missionary Societies from 1814. In 1840 the native chiefs ceded the sovereignty of New Zealand to the British Crown by the Treaty of Waitangi, concluded by the British Consul, Captain Hobson, and the islands became a British colony.

The aborigines, called Maoris, are a remarkable people—a branch of the Polynesian race. According to their own traditions, their forefathers came about 600 years, or twenty generations ago, from Hawaiki, which was probably Hawaii in the Sandwich Islands, or Savaii, in the Navigator, or Samoan group. They are divided into about twenty different clans, analogous to those of the Highlands of Scotland. There have been two Maori wars; the first lasted from 1845 until 1848; the second lasted from 1860, with little intermission, until 1870. But fully half the clans have always been friendly to the English; and many of them fought on the side of the Colonial Government against their own countrymen. Permanent tranquillity was established in 1871 throughout the country. An agitation amongst certain tribes in 1881, which threatened for a time to create a disturbance, was promptly quelled by the Colonial Government. At the census taken in 1901, the Maoris (including half-castes) amounted to 43,143, all of whom dwelt in the North Island, with the exception of some 2,232 scattered over the other islands.

Constitution.

The country was at first a dependency of New South Wales, but was separated by letters patent in 1842. Its settlement was largely effected by the New Zealand Company, with a royal charter, which was surrendered in 1860.

Down to 1847 the Executive and Legislative Councils were both nominated by the Governor, and constitutional form of Government was established by the Imperial Statute 15 & 16 Vict., cap. 72. By that Act the Colony was divided into six provinces, subsequently increased to nine—viz., Auckland, Taranaki, Wellington, Nelson, Canterbury, Otago, Hawke’s Bay, Westland, and Marlborough—each governed by a Superintendent and Provincial Council, elected by the inhabitants under a franchise which practically amounted to household suffrage.

By an Act of the General Assembly, 39 Vict., No. XXI., passed in 1876, the provincial system of government was abolished. The powers previously exercised by superintendents and provincial officers are now exercised by the Governor or by local boards. The provincial system being abolished, provision was made for the division of the Colony into counties and boroughs, and the necessary machinery for their self-government was provided.

A Central Legislature, called the General Assembly, was also established by the Imperial Statute of 1852, consisting of the Governor, a Legislative Council, and House of Representatives. The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council, composed of the Responsible Ministers of the Colony for the time being, according to the usual practice of Parliamentary Government. The Legislative Councillors are appointed by the Governor, and up to 1891 held their seats for life. Under the Act passed in that year, future appointments are tenable for seven years only. The members of the House of Representatives are chosen by electors possessing a liberal franchise. Every male elector is qualified to become a member. The House of Representatives now consists of 80, including 4 Maori members, elected by the natives. The session is usually from June to October.

Payment of Members of the Legislative Council is at the rate of 200l. a year, payable monthly. Members of the House of Representatives receive 25l. a month, amounting to 300l. per annum.

The Electoral Act, 1893, extended to women (of both races) the right to register as electors, and to vote at the elections for members of the House of Representatives.

The franchise for European representation is as follows:—Every adult person, if resident one year in the Colony and three months in one electoral district, can be registered as an elector.

The property qualification was abolished by “The Electoral Act Amendment Act, 1896,” and residence alone now entitles a man or woman to have his or her name placed upon an electoral roll.

For Maori representation every adult Maori resident in the district can vote, and no registration is required. There are four Maori electoral districts.

For local bodies the qualification is a property or residential one. Women can vote as well as men.

The control of native affairs, and the entire responsibility of dealing with questions of native government were transferred in 1863 from the Imperial to the Colonial Government. In 1865 the seat of Government was removed from Auckland to Wellington, on account of the central position of the latter city.

Local Government.

For the purposes of local government the Colony is divided into 100 municipalities and 94 counties; the latter being subdivided into 216 road districts and 34 town districts. For the year ended 31st March, 1904, the total receipts of the various local authorities amounted to 2,557,130l., and their expenditure to 2,502,830l. Their outstanding loans of the same date amounted to 4,321,584l. For the year ended 31st December, 1903, the receipts, expenditure and debt of Harbour Boards amounted to 671,004l., 663,103l., and 4,308,851l. respectively, and of the Christchurch Drainage Board to 21,142l., 24,420l., and 218,600l. respectively. The Dunedin Drainage and Sewerage Board receipts, 48,709l.; expenditure, 36,206l.; debt, 44,375l.

Education.

A Government system of primary education was established by Law No. 21 of 1877. The central administration is vested in a Minister of Education, and the local control is in the hands of Education Boards, and of School Committees with functions subordinate to those of the Boards. Number of schools on 31st December, 1904, 1,785; number of scholars on roll, 135,475 (including 2,298 Maoris or half-castes living as Maoris). The schools are free and non-sectarian, and education is compulsory. The University of New Zealand examines and confers degrees and gives scholarships. It has a statutory endowment of 3,000l. a year. There are four colleges for University teaching, at Dunedin, Christchurch, Wellington, and Auckland. All have landed endowments,
and the two last-named have statutory sub-
sidies of £4,000 each year. There are twenty-
seven bodies, endowed with land or funds arising
from public sources, for the purpose of carrying
on secondary education. The number of pupils
on the rolls at the schools governed by these
bodies for the fourth quarter of 1904 was 4,038.

A comprehensive statute dealing with the
carrying on of manual and technical instruction
was passed in 1900. During 1903 the Govern-
ment distributed 24,209l. in aid of various technical
schools and classes. The examination of the
Science and Art Department (South Kensington),
and the City and Guilds of London Institute are
made use of, and 363 passes in various subjects,
theoretical and practical, were obtained in 1903.
There are eight fully equipped schools of art. In
connection with the Otago University there is a
fully equipped School of Mines; and there are
also two Government Schools of Mines at centres
where mining work is actively engaged in. In
connection with the Canterbury College there is
an endowed School of Engineering and Technical
Science. The Canterbury Agricultural College
possesses extensive buildings, has a large endow-
ment of land and an experimental farm of very
complete character.

There are also (1904) 100 schools for natives,
maintained at the cost of the Government and
under the direct control of the Minister, and five
denominational boarding schools. The number
at the boarding schools was 262, of whom 91
were supported by Government; and at the
other schools 3,754.

Of the 1,918 children belonging to the ten
authorised industrial schools, 603 were in resi-
dence and 548 were boarded out with foster-
parents. The rest were at service, with friends,
etc., under licence.

The number of pupils in the Deaf Mute Institu-
tion was 65; the greatest part of the cost is
defrayed by the Government.

To the School for the Blind, under the manage-
ment of a local society, the Government contri-
butes a subsidy to the extent, approximately, of
24s. for each 20s. subscribed, and pays 25l. a year
for each pupil whom it sends to the school.
There were 24 such pupils at the end of 1904.

Population.

The population of New Zealand on 31st March,
1901, was found by the census to be 772,719
persons, excluding the Maoris, who numbered
43,143. The estimated population on 31st Dec.,
1904, was 867,539 exclusive of Maoris (43,143),
and Cook and other Pacific Islands (12,292).

The population of the chief towns on the 28th
March, 1886; 5th April, 1891; 12th April, 1896;
and 31st March, 1901, was as follows:

| Year | Wellington | Dunedin | Auckland | Christchurch |
|------|------------|---------|----------|--------------|
| 1886 | 25,945     | 23,243  | 33,161   | 15,265       |
| 1891 | 37,441     | 22,815  | 31,424   | 10,904       |
| 1896 | 37,441     | 22,815  | 31,424   | 10,904       |
| 1901 | 37,441     | 22,815  | 31,424   | 10,904       |

Industry.

All the productions of the temperate climates
of Europe and Asia can be cultivated with great
success in New Zealand. There are extensive
coal mines and rich gold fields. The gold entered
for exportation from the Colony up to 31st
December, 1904, was valued at 65,136,648l.; and
the annual production is about two millions
sterling. The wool exported in 1904 amounted
to 144,647,376 lbs., valued at 4,673,826l. In 1895
it amounted to 1,772,344 lbs., valued at 93,104l.
The trade in frozen meat, which began in 1882
with an export of 15,244 cwt., valued at 19,339l.,
had developed an export for 1889 of 656,822 cwt.,
valued at 783,374l., in 1893 to 903,836 cwt.,
valued at 1,083,167l., and in 1898, 1,551,773
cwt., valued at 1,698,750l., in 1901, 1,857,547
cwt., valued at 2,253,262l., in 1902, 2,138,567
cwt., valued at 2,718,763l., in 1903, 2,378,660 cwt.,
valued at 3,197,043l., in 1904, 1,912,979 cwt.,
valued at 2,793,599l. The live stock in New Zea-
land, as returned in 1904, were: horses, 314,322,
against 99,859 in 1874; cattle, 1,738,860, against
494,917 in 1874; sheep, 18,280,806, against
11,704,853 in 1874. The number of acres
under cultivation in October, 1904, was 1,494,722,
exclusive of 12,310,039 acres in sown grasses,
258,015 acres were in wheat, having an estimated
yield of 9,123,673 bushels; 342,189 acres were
in oats, estimated yield 14,563,611 bushels.

Auckland, Dunedin, Invercargill, Lyttelton,
Napier, Nelson, and Wellington are ports of
registry, and had, on 31st Dec., 1904, 579 vessels
registered, of 109,859 (net) tons in the aggregate.

The imports consist chiefly of textiles, hardware
and machinery, sugar, tea, alcohol, books, and
stationery; and they are obtained almost entirely
from England, Australia, the United States, and
China.

Banking and Currency.

The following banks have branches in the
Colony:—Bank of New Zealand, National Bank
of New Zealand (Limited), Union Bank of
Australia (Limited), Bank of New South Wales,
and Bank of Australasia. The total amount of
their deposits in New Zealand on 31st Dec., 1904,
was 18,548,739l., and of their note circulation
1,451,813l. There is also a Post Office Savings Bank
established in the Colony, having now 510 branches;
the amount deposited therein on 31st December,
1904, was 7,761,382l. The private savings banks
number five, and the total amount to credit of
depositors at the end of 1904 was 1,077,925l.

The currency and legal tender is exclusively
British sterling.

Government Insurance Department.

This department was constituted on the initia-
tive of Sir J. Vogel, by legislative enactments
passed in 1869 and 1870, and commenced to
transact business in March of the latter year. Its
constitution was subsequently modified by Acts
passed in 1874, 1884, 1886, 1888, 1890, 1891, 1893,
1894 and 1899. By the Act of 1886 an official
board to control and manage the investment of a
portion of the department's funds in mortgages
on land is now constituted. This board consists
of the Colonial Treasurer, the Solicitor-General,
the Surveyor-General, the Commissioner of
Taxes, the Public Trustee, and the Govern-
ment Insurance Commissioner. The Act of
1894 empowers loans on mortgage not exceed-
ing 10,000l. to any one person or company.
All policies are guaranteed by the State.

(April, 1905.)
By an Act passed in 1899 a separate branch of the department was constituted for the purpose of transacting Personal Accident Insurance and Employers' Liability Insurance.

The conditions under which policies are issued are very liberal, whilst the premium rates are extremely low. Insurances are effected on individual first-class lives to the amount of £4,000, and in the case of the Accident Branch to the amount of £1,000. All profits belong absolutely and entirely to the policy holders themselves.

A reference to the table hereunder will show the scale of premiums charged for the principal classes of business transacted, the amount of profits which have been divided amongst the policy holders, and the rapid growth of the office.

The last valuation was made upon the basis of Hm 3½ per cent.

### Public Works.

As in most of the Colonies, all the more important public works of New Zealand are in the hands of the Government and other public bodies, comparatively few having been undertaken by companies. The initiation of public works in New Zealand is coëval with the founding of the Colony. In the early days they simply kept pace with the spread of settlement, but in 1870 a great impetus was given to the progress of the country by the inauguration of the "Public Works Policy," which provided for carrying out works in advance of settlement, and for immigration.

The first public works initiated were roads, many thousands of miles having been constructed in all directions. Some of the main roads through sparsely settled districts were made, and are still maintained by the Government, but the ordinary main roads are under the control of the counties, and the district roads under local boards. Nearly all the larger rivers on the main roads in both islands are bridged. A few, however, have ferries worked by the current.

At the end of the last financial year, 31st March, 1905, there were 2,374 miles of Government and 113 miles of private railways in operation in New Zealand, and 173 miles of Government under construction.

The expenditure on the 2,374 miles of Government railways has been £21,701,572., or an average of £9,141. a mile; this includes all charges connected with the construction and equipment of the lines.

The revenue from the Government railways for the year 1904-1905 was £2,209,231., and the working expenses £1,492,900. The balance of £716,331. is equal to a return of 3½ 6s. percent. on the capital invested. The gauge throughout is 3ft. 6in.

Of telegraphs there are now 7,944 miles of land lines and 23,704 miles of wire, constructed at a cost of £1,132,990. There are five submarine cables connecting the two islands of New Zealand, two, Wakapauka-La Perouse, connecting the Colony with Australia.

The Pacific cable, which was opened for traffic to Australia and Fiji in April, 1902, was completed to Bamfield, Vancouver Island, on the 31st October following, and opened for international traffic on the 8th December.

The Pacific cable traffic is transmitted across the Atlantic by the Anglo-American and Commercial Telegraph companies. Following the opening of the Pacific cable a much faster cable service between the Colony and America and Europe has resulted, and the time has also improved on the Eastern Extension Company's lines. Messages via the Pacific from London frequently reach the colony within thirty minutes, and the average time of transmission may be put down at about ninety minutes, which should be regarded as a really good service.

The Pacific traffic is steadily growing, and since the completion of the cable the colony's telegraph business by both routes has increased by about 50 per cent.

On the opening of the Pacific cable for through traffic the ordinary rate to Great Britain was reduced from 3s. 4d. to 3s. a word, a previous reduction from 5s. 2d. to 3s. 4d. having been made by the Eastern Company as from the 1st June, 1902; Government messages from 2s. 4d. to 1s. 6½d., and Press from 1s. 2d. to 1s. a word. The following reduced rates were also brought
into operation: to Vancouver and San Francisco, 2s. 4d. per word; to New York, 2s. 8d. per word; a reduction of 2s. 6d. and 1s. 8d. per word on the rates formerly charged via Eastern. Corresponding reductions came into force for America generally.

The average number of messages transmitted to and from New Zealand prior to the opening of the Pacific cable was about 425 per day. The present average is nearly 600 a day by both routes.

To the advent of the Pacific cable is to be credited the general reduction of rates and the improvement in the cable services generally. The reduced rates based on the present traffic, it is estimated, mean a saving of over 50,000l. a year to business firms and other users of the cables between New Zealand and other parts of the world.

In the year ending 31st March, 1905, excluding the value of Government messages, the revenue was 250,063l. (including telephone exchange and other telegraph receipts); number of messages 5,159,745 (of which number 4,900,495 were private or press messages). The principal towns have telephone exchanges. In March, 1905, there were 28 exchanges and 57 sub-exchanges in operation.

Tramways have been established in all the principal towns in New Zealand, and Dunedin has, in addition, two cable lines leading to high-lying suburbs, and Wellington an incline line. The ordinary tramways are in some cases worked by steam motors, but horse-power is more generally employed. The cable tramways are practically on the same system as those in San Francisco.

Auckland, Dunedin, Christchurch, and Wellington have electric tramway systems on the overhead principle.

The Government has expended about 700,000l. on the construction of reservoirs, water-races, and sludge-channels on the gold-fields.

All the cities and principal towns are supplied with water at the cost of the corporations; Auckland, Napier, and Lyttelton have pumping schemes, but the others are supplied by gravitation.

All the principal towns in the Colony have gasworks, some of them belonging to private companies, but the majority to the corporations. The native coal from Greytown is stated to be one of the best in the world for making gas. In Wellington the streets are illuminated by the electric light, as also are the parliamentary buildings and many private houses and business establishments.

The coasts of the Colony are well marked with lighthouses and beacons, and all the ports are provided with wharves and jetties in proportion to the trade. Important works to afford shelter and increase the depth of water have been executed or are in course of construction at Dunedin, Oamaru, Timaru, Lyttelton, Greymouth, Westport, New Plymouth, and Napier. There are graving docks at Port Chalmers, Lyttelton, and Auckland. At Wellington there is a patent slip capable of taking up a two thousand ton ship.

The Public Works of the Colony, including both railways and roads, are now principally carried out on what is known as the co-operative system,—that is, the Government provides all materials and lets the work of construction to parties of artisans and labourers at rates fixed by the officers of the Government, and calculated so that an average workman will be able to earn the current rate of wages ruling in his trade in the district where the work is situated. The ruling rates of wages are from 9s. to 12s. per day for artisans, and from 7s. to 10s. for labourers. Eight hours constitutes a working day.

Mail Communication.

There is regular mail communication with England by direct steamers and via San Francisco, Vancouver, Brindisi, Naples, and Marseilles, and with all Australian ports, the South Sea Islands, United States, Canada, Uruguay, and Brazil.

Postages Rates.

The postage on letters inland, and to such other places as will accept matter at the reduced rate is 1d. for each ½ ounce. The reduction applies in any case to the countries within the Empire which have joined the penny post arrangement,* and to a number of foreign countries which have agreed to deliver letters from New Zealand prepaid at 1d. without surcharge, although not applying the rate reciprocally. Letters from New Zealand for the Commonwealth of Australia, prepaid 1d. for each ½ ounce, are now delivered by the Commonwealth without surcharge. The

Schaw, and other Imperial officers, for fortifying the ports of Auckland, Wellington, Lyttelton, and Dunedin, by strong batteries and a complete system of submarine mines have been carried into execution, with such adjuncts and alterations as have become necessary and advisable from time to time.

A permanent force of Artillery and Submarine miners is maintained; and a large force of volunteers and rifle clubs has also been organised.

DEPENDENCIES OF NEW ZEALAND.†

Cook Islands.

The Cook Islands were declared to be under British protection in October, 1888, by Captain Bourke, of H.M.S. "Hyacinth," and the Hervey Islands, Manuae, Te Au-o-Tu and Takutea, by Commander Nicolls, of H.M.S. "Cormorant," in June, 1889.

Until 1901 British authority was represented by a Resident who was paid by the Government of New Zealand, and reported direct to the Governor of that Colony. The first British Resident, Mr. F. J. Moas, who was appointed in 1890, succeeded in 1891 in arranging for the establishment of an Elective Federal Parliament to make laws for the whole group. Each island, however, continued to enjoy self-government in such purely local affairs as it could properly manage for itself. The Federal Executive Council or Government was composed of the Ariki, or Kings and Queens, who are also the principal landowners. The chief of these, Queen Makea, Ariki of Avarua, was the nominal head of the Government. A Supreme Court was established, and a law was passed regulating the sale of intoxicants, and imposing a general ad valorem duty of 10 per cent. on imports. All laws and administrative acts were subject to the approval of the Resident, who was also a Deputy and Judicial Commissioner for the Western Pacific, and Chief Justice of the High Court of the Cook Islands.

† A full account of these Dependencies will be found in the "New Zealand Official Year Book," to which the Editors desire to express their acknowledgements.

The Islands became part of the Colony of New Zealand from the 11th June, 1901. The Act of that year placed all the annexed islands under one administration. By the amending Act of 1903, Niue was placed under a separate administration.

Resident Commissioner, Col. W. E. Gudgeon, C.M.G.

Rarotonga.

Distant from Auckland, 1,638 miles; circumference, 20 miles; height, 2,100 ft.; area, 26 square miles; population, 1,910.

Rarotonga is the most fertile and valuable of the Cook group, and it has the largest population. The island has been exceptionally favoured by nature, not only with delightful scenic attractions, but also with a remarkably rich and productive soil.

The aborigines are very closely akin to the Maoris of New Zealand.

The seat and centre of the government of the Cook Islands—the double township of Avarua and Avatiu—is situated on the north or lee side of the island of Rarotonga, opposite two small openings in the coral reef. The former has the advantage of a boat harbour, where small craft can be moored in safety when the wind is not blowing in from the sea. The residence of the Commissioner and the establishment of the ex-queen are situated here.

The dwellings of the natives are built of coral concrete, as are also the Government offices.

Goods received from the Cook and other annexed islands are now treated as New Zealand produce, and not as imports. The total in 1904 was valued at £5,617, and the principal articles of produce as follows: lime-juice, 948l.; raw coffee, 394l.; copra, 3,775l.; fruit, 35,639l.; cocoanuts, 229l.; hats, 4,239l.

The exports from New Zealand to the Cook and other islands in 1904 amounted to £8,644l.

Revenue and expenditure of the Cook and Northern Islands.

Mangaia.

Distant from Rarotonga, 116 miles; circumference, 30 miles; height, 656 ft.; area, 30 square miles; population, 1,507.

Physical Features.

Mangaia is the most southerly island of the Cook group, and is second in importance to Rarotonga only on account of its difficult and dangerous coast.

Cocoanuts, bananas, oranges, limes, citrons and other fruits grow plentifully. The annual export of copra is large, as is also that of perishable fruits. The natives have cultivated much of the land, and owing to their industry the productions of the island have a favourable name. The coffee is the best produced in the Cook group, not from any superiority of soil or climate, but because of the care exercised in picking and drying the berries.

Resident Agent, J. T. Large.

* Figures for 1901-2 are for nine months only.
ATIU.

Distant from Rarotonga, 116 miles; circumference, 20 miles; height, 374 ft.; area, 32 square miles; population, 918.

The Island.

Atiu resembles Mangaia in formation, being a raised mass of coral with high jagged cliffs facing the sea.

On the highest point of the central ridge coconuts, bananas, oranges, and coffee grow with the utmost luxuriance; and the kumara, most valuable and uncertain of South Sea vegetables, yields large crops. The coconut-palm grows well everywhere, but especially so on the coral rock formation, though only a few hundred trees are to be found there. Coffee and oranges grow vigorously, but very few trees are to be seen.

Mauke, Mitiaro, and Takutea belong to the Atiuans.

Acting Resident Agent, A. von Nagel.

MAUKE.

Distant from Rarotonga, 150 miles; circumference, 10 miles; height, about 60 ft.; area, 5½ square miles; population, 338.

Mauke is a low circular island about two miles across, lying to the north-east of Rarotonga. Like Mangaia and Atiu, it is surrounded by an unbroken fringing reef. It is marvellously fertile, and in value and quantity the produce exported is greater than that of Atiu.

MITIARO.

Distant from Rarotonga, 140 miles; circumference, 5 miles; height, about 50 ft.; area, 4 square miles; population, 218.

This island is a good instance of an elevated coral reef, thinly coated with sand and gravel of the same material. The surface is not more than six feet above high-water mark.

Copra is the only article of regular export, but in the centre of the island there is a fertile patch whereon oranges and bananas are grown with moderate success.

TAKUTEA.

Distant from Rarotonga, 125 miles; area, 2 square miles.

This island is uninhabited, but belongs to the tribes of Atiu, who visit it for a few weeks in each year to make copra. It is a coral island, moderately fertile, and will be utilised as a Government plantation.

AITUTAKI.

Distance from Rarotonga, 140 miles; circumference, 14½ miles; height, 366 ft.; area, 7 square miles; population, 907.

The name includes the island anciently known as "Arahura," and some seven or eight smaller islands on the vast barrier reef. Some of these are volcanic, and would seem to have been small peaks on the lip of an extinct volcano, now submerged.

The island itself is pear-shaped, about four miles by two; its highest part being 366 feet high.

Some of the best oranges in the New Zealand market, known as "Tahiti," are from Aitutaki, while the best pineapples in the Eastern Pacific are from the same place. The remaining articles of export are copra, and lime-juice of very good quality.

The Aitutakians are naturally a hardy race, and industrious when away from their own homes. They are said to be the best sailors in the Cook group, and their services are much in demand for working the cargo on vessels at Tahiti. They make fans and mats, and are expert at plaiting various fibres for hatmaking.

Resident Agent, J. C. Cameron.

MANUAE AND TE AU-O-TU.

Distant from Rarotonga, 120 miles; area of Manuae, 1½ square miles; population 10.

These two small islands are better known as the Hervey Group. They are situated about midway between Atiu and Aitutaki, and are owned by the people of the latter place.

The islands have been leased to a European firm, with the result that the export of copra has risen from 36 tons in 1898 to 64 tons in 1901. During the same period the Cook Island Trading Company has planted 30,000 young palms, and Manuae now bids fair to be the leading copra island of the Cook group within the next ten or twelve years.

OTHER ISLANDS.

NIUE.

Distant from Rarotonga, 580 miles; circumference, 40 miles; height, 200 ft.; area, 100 square miles; population, 4,100.

Niue, or Savage Island, is a long, low island, fringed with a misty cloud of fine spray. The shores being too deep and steep to support a barrier reef, the coast-line is deprived of its protection. It is fertile, but fresh water is very scarce.

Much of the land is encumbered with a dense scrub of guava bush.

The orange, the cocoanut, and other tropical products grow well, and the lemon flourishes on the rocky shores.

The natives of Niue are somewhat different in character from other Polynesians. They are very industrious, and the men are often engaged at Tonga and elsewhere as labourers. The girls and women plait hats, which are exported to New Zealand and Australia. They are keen traders, but are much averse to strangers obtaining a foothold in the island itself.

The exports for 1903 amounted to 7,652l., and the imports to 8,001l. The revenue for 1903-4 (including balance from previous year) was 2,965l., and the expenditure 1,245l. Total balance to credit on 31st March, 1904, 2,117l.

Resident Commissioner, C. F. Maxwell.

PALMERSTON ATOLL.

Distant from Rarotonga, 273 miles; area, 1 square mile; population, 118.

The Palmerstons are situated upon an irregular ring of coral reef, measuring outside about four miles and a half by two miles and a half, just awash with the tide. The narrow ring is about half a mile in width, and it supports eight little islets, nearly all covered with cocoanut palms. The largest of these is little more than half a mile in length and about a quarter of a mile wide. Under its grove of palms is the settlement of the entire population of the group. The lagoon and reef abound with fish, and turtles are caught in plenty.

Copra is the only article of export.

Resident Agent, J. Marsters.
Penrhyn.

Distant 735 miles from Rarotonga; area, 3 square miles; population 433.

This atoll is known to the Polynesians as Tongareva or Ma-ngaro-ngaro and is valuable only by reason of the existence of pearlshell beds in the extensive lagoon. The extent and value of these shell-beds is only imperfectly known, for the native population is small, and they do no more work than will provide them with food and clothing. It is estimated that about 50 tons is annually exported, and that the value ranges from 100L to 200L per ton.

The cocoanut crop is considerable. Fresh water is very scarce.

Resident Agent, Captain M. J. Nagle.

Suwarrow.

Distant from Rarotonga, 530 miles; area, ½ square mile; population 30.

Suwarrow is an atoll with a splendid lagoon, which produces a very good class of pearlshell. The present yield of shell is nearly 50 tons per annum.

Manihiki and Rakahanga.

Distant from Rarotonga, 650 and 670 miles respectively; area, each 2 square miles; population, Manihiki, 552; Rakahanga, 340.

Manihiki, or Humphrey, is nearly circular. Bêche-de-mer is obtained from the lagoon. The island occasionally suffers from drought.

Rakahanga, or Rierson, is also an atoll.

The former has until lately produced a limited amount of pearlshell, but about the end of 1900 it was found that the beds were exhausted by over-fishing. The lagoon was therefore closed.

The only industry is now that of copra-making.

Resident Agent, H. Williams.

Pukapuka, or Danger Island, and Nassau.

Pukapuka is a small solitary atoll about three miles in diameter, which produces pearlshell. It is about 700 miles from Rarotonga, and has an area of two square miles. The population is 492 persons.

Nassau is also a small island within the extended boundaries. It is said to be uninhabited.

Education.

The education of the children living in the Cook group is in the hands of the London Missionary Society, which provides some 1,800 children in the Cook and Northern Islands with a sound and useful education. At Tereora, in Rarotonga, the Mission supplies an English education for the children of those leading men that are willing to pay a small fee per annum. At the present time there are 40 children at Tereora under a qualified teacher, and in aid of this establishment a subsidy of 4L per head is paid by the Islands Government.

To sum up the educational work now being done by the London Mission Society: 1,575 children are being taught to read and write Maori, 250 are receiving an elementary English Education, and 40 are receiving a fifth standard education. To the above must be added the good work done by the Sisters of St. Joseph, who have established themselves in Rarotonga, and have some 50 pupils.

Trade.

Oranges and bananas have heretofore been the chief exports, and the latter are being extensively planted. The fruit trade is developing satisfactorily, but it is on the export of copra that dependence must chiefly be placed.

The following statement will show the present and estimated possible yield of copra for each island:

| Island     | Present Production | Estimated Production |
|------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Rarotonga  | 150                | 2,000                |

| Pukapuka   | 100                | 200                  |

Laws.

The following are shortly the provisions of "The Cook and other Islands Government Act, 1901," which now regulates the laws in force and hereafter to be made within the Cook and other Islands included in the Colony of New Zealand, by virtue of the Order in Council of the 13th May, 1901:

Subject to the provisions of the Act, local laws and usages are to continue until other provision is made. Power is given to the Governor in Council to direct that any of the laws in force in the said Islands may be modified or repealed.

Section 3 of the Amendment Act passed in 1902 allows the Governor, by Order in Council, to direct that any of the laws in force in New Zealand, other than the laws relating to the sale of alcoholic liquors, shall have operation in the said Islands, either in whole or with such modifications as may be necessary to adapt them to the conditions and circumstances of the said Islands and the inhabitants thereof.

Section 4 provides that the Courts of Justice in the said Islands, and the Judge and officers thereof, shall continue until other provision is made, and the jurisdiction of the High Court is extended to all the Islands, Niue, however, being excepted by the Amendment Act of 1903, which placed it under a separate administration. Appeals from the decisions of the High Court are allowed to the Supreme Court of New Zealand, and thence to the Court of Appeal, subject to regulations.

Section 6 gives power to the Governor, by Order in Council, to establish a tribunal, or appoint an officer, or officers, to ascertain and determine the title to lands within the said Islands, distinguishing titles acquired by Native customs and usage, from titles otherwise lawfully acquired. Provision may be made for the issue of instruments of title.

Section 7 states that the Federal Parliament and the Native Councils existing at the commencement of the Act may continue, but shall thereafter be called the "Federal Council" and
"Island Councils" respectively. Enactments made by them are to be called "Federal Ordinances" and "Local Ordinances."

Section 8 defines the powers of the Councils as follows: The Federal Council shall have power to make Federal Ordinances for the government of all the Islands. Each of the Island Councils shall have power to make local Ordinances for the government of the inhabitants within its jurisdiction, it is provided that such Federal and local Ordinances shall be transmitted by the Resident Commissioner to the Governor, and shall have no force or effect until assented to in the name of His Majesty.

Section 10 deals with duties of Customs and makes the New Zealand tariff applicable to the Islands, and under the Amendment Acts of 1902 and 1903 the Governor in Council is empowered to modify the tariff as affecting any of the Islands. No drawback is to be paid in New Zealand on goods shipped to the Islands. Goods the produce or manufacture of New Zealand, or on which duty has already been paid in New Zealand, are to be admitted free to the said Islands, and, similarly, all goods the produce or manufacture of the said Islands are to be admitted free to New Zealand.

The laws are enforced through the High Court, which has jurisdiction throughout the whole of the Islands (excepting Niue); and, in the Cook group, until last year, there were also what were known as the Arikis' Courts. These have now been abolished in those islands to which a European Resident Agent has been appointed, and that officer exercises the jurisdiction and power of the Arikis' Court or a judge thereof. These local Courts deal with all minor offences, and appeals are allowed from them to the High Court. The High Court has exclusive jurisdiction in all cases of murder, or of assault with intent to commit murder, and in all cases of manslaughter; in all criminal charges against foreign residents; and in all cases between foreign residents, or between foreign residents and Maoris in which the plaintiff may, with the consent of the Chief Judge, begin an action in the Court, or may, with the same consent, seek redress for any wrong alleged to have been done by any local Government in any island. The Chief Judge has power to send any case of a criminal charge against a foreign resident for trial before a Court constituted under the provisions of the Pacific Order in Council. The headquarters of the High Court are at Rarotonga, where it sits once a week, but visits are periodically made to the other islands within its jurisdiction.
