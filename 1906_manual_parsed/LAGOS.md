LAGOS.

[Steps are being taken to amalgamate Lagos and Southern Nigeria.]

Situation and Area.

The Colony of Lagos is situated on the Bight of Benin, and consists of the coast line from the boundary of Dahomey on the west, to the S. Nigerian boundary, one mile south-east of the village of Omoloma, on the confines of the Shekiri Country, on the Mahin Beach on the east; and includes Badagry, Lagos Island (the capital of the Colony), Ebute Metta, Iddo Island, Ikorodu, Ejirin, and Epe, with Palma, Leckie, and Ode.

Ikorodu is the latest acquisition to the Colony (ceded August, 1894), and the Jebu strip on the north bank of the lagoon now extends from Orichi on the Oguri River, in a direct line half a mile to the north of the village of Majoda, situated on the road between Epe and Jebu Ode, and from thence proceeding due east to the Oshun River. By this acquisition the Colony commands all the main routes to the interior.

The Protectorate before 1900 comprised the kingdoms of Pokra, Okeodan, Ilaro, Ado, and Igbesa, with the Awori country, Jebu Remo (1894), Mahin, Itebu, Ayesah, and Ibu, up to the town of Ogbo on the east, where it adjoins the territory of the Niger Coast Protectorate.

By an Order in Council issued at the end of 1899 the Protectorate was extended to the boundaries of Northern and Southern Nigeria. It includes the whole of the Yoruba country.

The boundary with Dahomey is at the coast at 2° 46' 55" E. long., and was delimited in 1896 by an Anglo-French Commission as far as the 9th parallel.

For administrative purposes the country is divided into the central, the western, the north-western, the eastern, and the north-eastern districts, with District Commissioners stationed respectively at Lagos, Badagry, Shagamu, and Epe. The police magistrate of Lagos is District Commissioner of the central district. The Shagamu and Ikorodu districts are administered as one, and the Epe and Lekki as one, the respective district headquarters being Shagamu and Epe. In the Hinterland resident officers are stationed at Ibadan, Shaki, Meko, Ijebu-Ode, Ilesha, and Ode-Ondo. There is also a Commissioner for the railway, who resides in the town of Abeokuta.

Lagos Island has an area of 3½ square miles, and the whole Colony about 3,420 square miles, and the Colony and Protectorate about 24,500 square miles.

The port is 4,279 miles from Liverpool, 1,203 miles from Freetown, 315 miles from Cape Coast, and 232 miles from Brass. At this part of the West Coast a series of low islands runs along the coast, separating the mainland from the sea, and forming numerous lagoons and creeks. Along these lagoons steamers ply, without entering the ocean, as far as Porto Novo on the west and Siluko on the Ofus Wena River, the boundary with Southern Nigeria on the east; and the only opening for many miles to the sea is at Lagos. Vessels drawing more than 10ft.6in. cannot safely get through the bar; passengers are transferred into tenders by means of surf boats, and the vessels proceed with most of their cargoes to Forcados, a distance of 200 miles, and there tranship into tenders.

History.

The King of Lagos (Kosoko), having refused to co-operate in putting down the slave trade, was expelled by a British force in 1851, and his cousin Akitoye placed on the throne, by whom a treaty was concluded under which he bound himself to put down the slave trade. A Consul was appointed, but the treaty was not fully adhered to by Akitoye's son and successor, King Docemo, who was induced on the 6th of August, 1861, to cede his possessions to the British Crown in consideration of a pension of £1,000. a year, which he continued to draw until his death in 1885.

The territories were erected into a separate Government by Letters Patent dated the 13th of March, 1863.

By the charter of the 19th of February, 1866, Lagos became a part of the Government of the West Africa Settlements, having a separate Legislative Council, but being subject to the Governor-in-Chief at Sierra Leone.

By the charter of the 24th July, 1874, Lagos became an integral part of the Gold Coast Colony.

By further Letters Patent dated 13th January, 1886, the whole of these territories were separated from the Gold Coast Colony, and erected into a separate Colony.

The original British settlements were Lagos Island and Iddo Island. In 1862, Palma and Leckie became British, and in 1863 Badagry was ceded by its chiefs. In 1879 the kingdom of Kotoum, lying to the south and east of the Denham waters, was, at the request of the king and chiefs, included in the protectorate, and in 1883 the kingdom of Appa, lying east of Kotoum, was also brought under British jurisdiction. On the east also the protectorate was, in 1886, extended as far as the Benin River, by the inclusion of part of the kingdom of Mahin, and of the Ogbo and Jakri territories.

* For Governors before 1871, see Edition for 1903.
In 1890, Kotonu was exchanged with the French Government for the kingdom of Pokra, lying between Porto Novo and Badagry.

In 1891 the kingdoms of Igbesa, Addo and Ilaro were included in the protectorate, and in 1894 Jebu Remo was similarly dealt with, Mahin, Itetu, Ibu, and Ayessan being proclaimed protectorates in 1896.

An expedition was sent against the Jebus in May, 1892, which resulted in the military occupation and eventual inclusion into the Colony of a portion of their country, and in the opening of a most important trade route to the interior.

Agreements have been concluded with the Egba native Government, and with the chiefs of the Ibadan, Oyo, and Ife provinces, vesting in His Majesty the King power and jurisdiction therein in all murder and manslaughter cases, and in all cases in which one or both of the parties is not a subject thereof respectively.

The amalgamation of the Colony of Lagos and the Protectorates of Southern Nigeria is under consideration, and the present Governor of Lagos is also High Commissioner in Southern Nigeria.

**Constitution.**

The Government is conducted by a Governor, assisted by an Executive and a Legislative Council. The latter includes five nominated unofficial members. The law consists entirely of local ordinances and Orders in Council, with such English Acts as are of general application.

The Colony was associated with Gambia, Sierra Leone, and the Gold Coast Colony in contributing towards the salary of the Bishop of Sierra Leone, but it now forms part of the Diocese of Western Equatorial Africa.

**Industry.**

There are no manufactures except the weaving of native cloths and mats, boat and canoe building, and brickmaking. A saw mill has been established, and native builders, carpenters, and blacksmiths do fair work.

Fishing is extensively pursued in the island waters, the fish being dried and sent into the interior.

Cotton planting has been commenced under the auspices of the Government, and the prospects are encouraging.

The British Cotton Growing Association have now, by arrangement with the Colonial Office, taken over the management of the industry, and very considerable tracts of land at Ilugan, near Ibadan, and between Aro and Abeokuta, have been drained, cleaned and planted.

An export trade in corn (maize) has recently sprung up, and is steadily growing.

A small sugar mill has also been erected at Agbowa, in the Colony, and there seems a possibility that the sugar-cane may be extensively grown in the near future.

Lagos was formerly one of the chief entrepôts for the export of slaves. It possesses a good harbour, which forms the only safe port along 1,000 miles of coast. It has unrivalled water communication with the interior by means of a network of lagoons and creeks. A very extensive trade has therefore grown up, amounting, in 1902, to over two millions. There is a large transit trade with Porto Novo and the leeward coast, as well as with the interior. The principal exports are palm oil and kernels, cotton goods, rubber, and mahogany. The chief imports are cotton goods, spirits, tobacco, and hardware, nearly the whole trade being with England and Germany, some exports going, however, to Brazil and France. The quantities and values of the principal exports during 1904 were—

| Item                  | Quantity       | Value   |
|-----------------------|----------------|---------|
| Cocoa                 | 821,732 lbs.   | £13,892 |
| Corn                  | 4,669 tons     | £16,115 |
| Cotton ginned         | 816 tons       | £12,330 |
| Cotton goods          |                | £16,352 |
| Mahogany              |                | £25,851 |
| Palm kernels          | 69,288 tons    | £680,441|
| Palm oil              | 3,196,442 gals | £219,114|
| Rubber                | 265,458 lbs.   | £22,961 |
| Specie               |                | £148,145|

**Chief Towns.**

Lagos Town, including Ebute Metta, has now about 42,000 inhabitants, and is the largest town on the whole West African coast. Epe is probably the largest town in the Colony outside Lagos, population about 16,000. The next largest towns are Badagry, with a population of 4,022, Leckie, and Ikorodu. In the interior Abeokuta and Ibadan are believed to contain about 150,000 and 200,000 inhabitants, respectively.

**Currency and Banking.**

By Ordinance No. 2 of 1880, the legal tender currency, and that generally in use, is British sterling, with gold dust and nuggets, and some Spanish, American, and French gold coins; but by Ordinance 7 of 1894 gold dust and nuggets were demonetised. Cowries (£1,000 = 3d.) are still occasionally employed for small transactions. Accounts are usually kept in sterling, but occasionally still in gallons of palm oil, or in cowries by the smaller native traders. A Government savings bank was established on the 1st of January, 1887, under the management of the Colonial Treasurer, and on 31st December, 1904, held deposits amounting to £22,474/. 8s. 8½d.

During 1891 a branch of the African Banking Company was established at Lagos, which has since been merged in a company named the Bank of British West Africa.

**Means of Communication.**

A railway has been constructed from Iddo Island (between Lagos and the mainland) to Ibadan, a distance of 123½ miles, and was opened to the public in March, 1901. The terminus is on Iddo Island, where a fine station has been erected, and is connected by bridges with the mainland and with Lagos. The line is 125 miles in length, and, excluding the bridges at Lagos, cost about £6,000 a mile. Carter bridge extends from Lagos to Iddo Island, and is 2,500 feet long, carried on steel screw piles some 100 feet long. The Denton railway and road bridges cross from Iddo Island to the mainland, and are 900 feet long. A branch line, about two miles in length, has been opened between Aro Junction (60 miles from Lagos) and Abeokuta. The extension of the line to Oshogbo has been sanctioned and will be proceeded with very shortly. A steam tramway connects Lagos Town with Iddo railway station. Lagos Island is now in telegraphic communication with the Congo, South Africa, Bonny and Brass, the Gold Coast, and Europe, and via Accra, with the Gaboon, Loanda, Kotonu, and Porto Novo, and there is also a land line connecting it with the Port of Torcados in S. Nigeria and with Jebba and Lokoja on the Niger. There is a weekly mail service to and
from these places, and communication about once a month with Hamburg. With Brazil and the United States there is communication by sailing vessels. The internal communication is chiefly by water, along the network of lagoons. There is telephonic communication between the various Government offices and principal commercial houses.

A system of Government inspection and examination has been introduced under the supervision of an Education Board and a Local Inspector of Schools, under which grants were made during 1903-4 to the schools of the various Christian denominations, amounting in all to 2,000l.; about 4,000 school children are on the school rolls. Fees are charged, and education is not compulsory. The Mohammedans, who are much on the increase, maintain their own schools, where Arabic is taught, and three Government schools, in which elementary English instruction is given, have been established for this section of the population.

Climate and Inhabitants.

In 1904 the monthly average shade temperature varied from 68°, the January minimum, to 92°, the March maximum. The rainfall for the year was 76·59 inches.

The native inhabitants are mainly of the negro race; about one-fourth of them speak English. There are about 300 persons of European birth in the Colony.

Defence.

The Lagos battalion of the West African Frontier Force consists of 17 European officers, 4 native officers, and 520 rank and file; they are armed with Martini-Enfield rifles. There is a civil police numbering 492, armed with Martini-Enfield carbines. There is also a detective branch numbering 15.
