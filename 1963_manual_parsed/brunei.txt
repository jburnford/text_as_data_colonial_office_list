Geographical Features

Brunei has a coastline of about 100 miles and
is split into two and surrounded on the landward
sides by Sarawak. In the west the valleys of the
Belait and the Tutong rivers, representing more
than half the area of the country, consist of
extensive swamps gradually changing through a
series of ridge and swamp formations into low
hills at the sources of the rivers. The Labi
hills in the extreme west cover an area of some
300 square miles and at no point exceed 1,300 feet
in height. In the east the Brunei district is
characterized by a number of steep rocky hills
of no great height rising from alluvial flats,
while Temburong, except near the coast, is hilly,
becoming mountainous as one approaches
Bukit Pagon, a spur from the main Bornean
range.

Climate

There are no well-defined seasons, but the rain-
fall tends to be heaviest from October to the middle
of January. The annual rainfall varies from
100 inches at the coast to over 200 inches in
certain parts of the interior. The temperature
rarely exceeds 90°; the usual daily range is
between 76° and 86°.

History

The Sultanate of Brunei was formerly a great
and powerful State and in the early years of the
sixteenth century the authority of its rulers
appears to have extended, not only over the
whole of the island of Borneo, but over the
Sulu Islands and some parts of the Philippines.
Towards the end of the sixteenth century its
power began to decline, the outlying territories
gradually fell away and by the beginning of the
nineteenth century the kingdom of Brunei had
dwindled so as to include only what is now
Sarawak and part of North Borneo.

At this period the town itself seems to have
degenerated to the condition of a slave market
for the sale of captives of Illanun and Sulu
pirates. Anarchy was rife in the outlying districts
and in 1841 Sarawak proper was ceded to Mr.
(later Sir James) Brooke in return for his services
in quelling an insurrection at Kuching and he
was declared Rajah of Sarawak. In 1846 the
island of Labuan was ceded to Great Britain as a
base for anti-piracy measures and in 1877 the
whole of the northern portion of Borneo was ceded to form the nucleus of what was to become British North Borneo. At various later dates further cessions were made to the Rajah of Sarawak and to the British North Borneo Company till the territories of the State were eventually reduced to their present circumscribed limits.

In 1847 the Sultan entered into a Treaty with Great Britain for the furtherance of commercial relations and the mutual suppression of piracy. An additional clause provided for extraterritorial jurisdiction over British subjects in Brunei, which provision was modified by an Agreement of 1856.

By a further Treaty made in 1888 Brunei was placed under the protection of Great Britain and the Sultan agreed that the foreign relations of the State should be conducted by Her Majesty's Government. Provision was also made for the setting up of Consular Courts with jurisdiction over British subjects and foreign subjects enjoying British protection. In 1905-06 a supplementary Agreement was entered into whereby the Sultan undertook to accept a British officer, to be styled Resident, who should be the agent and representative of the British Government under the High Commissioner for the Malay States (at that time the Governor of the Straits Settlements). The Governor of Sarawak was High Commissioner for Brunei from 1948 until 1959.

Constitution

On the 29th September 1959 His Highness the Sultan of Brunei promulgated the first written constitution for his State, which provides for a Privy Council, an Executive Council and a Legislative Council. The Executive and Legislative Councils replace the Brunei State Council. The post of British Resident has been abolished and there is instead a Mentri Besar (Chief Minister) appointed by the Sultan and responsible to His Highness for the exercise of executive authority in the State. The Executive Council is presided over by the Sultan and consists of seven ex officio Members, the High Commissioner and seven Unofficial Members. The Legislative Council is presided over by the Mentri Besar and comprises eight ex officio Members, six Official Members appointed by His Highness, sixteen Elected Members and three Members nominated by the Sultan.

Also on 29th September 1959 a new Agreement was concluded between Her Majesty The Queen and His Highness the Sultan replacing the 1905-06 Agreement, under which Her Majesty's Government continues to be responsible for defence and external affairs of the State. This provides for the appointment of a High Commissioner to advise the Sultan on such matters. The arrangement whereby the Governor of Sarawak was also High Commissioner for Brunei has ended. There is a separate post of High Commissioner for Brunei the holder of which resides in Brunei and is directly responsible to Her Majesty's Government.

December Revolt

In December 1962 an attempt was made to overthrow the Government by armed force. A. M. Azahari, leader of the Party Raayat, announced from Manila that he had been appointed by the Sultan of Brunei as Prime Minister of the combined territories of Brunei, North Borneo and Sarawak.

The Sultan denied Azahari's claims and, in accordance with the provisions of the 1959 Agreement, called upon Britain to assist him in restoring law and order in Brunei. This request was immediately met and, with the aid of British security forces, rebel resistance in major centres and in the oilfield areas was overcome within a few days.

Following the declaration of a state of emergency in December, the Legislative and Executive Councils were dissolved and the functions of Government were temporarily assumed by an Emergency Council consisting of the Sultan, four ex-officio members, the High Commissioner and ten unofficial members.

Federation of Malaysia

On 1st August 1962 the British and Malayan Governments announced their decision in principle that, subject to the necessary legislation and the working out of necessary safeguards for North Borneo and Sarawak, the proposed Federation of Malaysia would be established by the 31st August 1963.

The British and Malayan Governments informed the Sultan of Brunei of the agreement they had reached and made it clear that they would welcome the inclusion of the State of Brunei in the new Federation.

Land Policy

In the State a transfer charge, lease or sub-lease of land to a person who is not a natural born subject of the Sultan, or who has not resided in the State for periods amounting in the aggregate to not less than seven years during the ten years immediately preceding the date on which such instrument is delivered to the Land Officer, shall be subject to, and shall not be valid or registered without, the approval of the Sultan in Council.

Taxation

At present there is no Income Tax upon persons other than Companies. Companies are taxed at the rate of 30% upon their chargeable income. Import, export and excise duties are charged. A royalty is paid by the Brunei Shell Petroleum Company, based upon the amount of oil produced. A variety of licences are issued, mostly of a municipal nature.

Currency

The State is a party to the Malayan Currency Agreement and currency issued by the Malaya and British Borneo Currency Board is the only legal tender.

The standard coin is the Malayan silver dollar with a par of 2s. 4d., at which it is linked to sterling. Subsidiary coins are those of value of 50 cents, 20 cents, 10 cents and 5 cents. There is also copper coin of 1 cent. Currency notes are issued in different denominations from 50 cents upwards.

Development Plans

A sum of $100 million was set aside by the State Council in 1954 for a development programme estimated to take five years. By the end of 1959 total expenditure had reached $95,065,137.

Further Development expenditure of $12,729,908 (1960) and $7,974,981 (1961) was incurred.

A National Development Plan for the period 1962-66 is now being implemented.

Education

The number and type of institutions providing educational facilities are:

(a) 56 Malay vernacular schools, with a total enrolment of 11,454: 6,983 boys and 4,471 girls. These schools are fully maintained by Government. The Malay language is the medium of instruction and English is taught as a second language in the Fourth Year in some schools.

(b) Chinese schools, with an enrolment of 6,675: 3,705 boys and 2,970 girls. These schools receive 50% of their recurrent costs from Government and building grants, the rest of their recurrent income is derived from school fees and subscriptions from the Chinese community in the area in which the school is situated. The Brunei Shell Petroleum Company, Limited, gives financial aid to the two Chinese schools in the Oilfields area. The medium of instruction in all Chinese schools is Mandarin. Malay is taught as a subject in all Chinese schools. English is taught as a subject from the First Year.

(c) Schools in which the medium of instruction is English—

(i) Government schools:—Three secondary, one for Boys, one for Girls and one co-educational. All have preparatory departments.

(ii) Seven mission schools:—Three Anglican (Diocese of Borneo), and four Roman Catholic. The mission schools are maintained by school fees and Mission funds. Those situated in the Oilfields area receive financial aid from the Oil Company. One mission school provides secondary education.

Enrolments are:—

| Boys | Girls |
|------|-------|
| Government Secondary Schools (including Prep. Departments) | 993 | 414 |
| Mission Schools | 1,493 | 1,174 |

(d) One Trades School (Technical) is maintained by the Brunei Shell Petroleum Company Limited, Government contributing 19% of the operating cost to finance an apprenticeship scheme. The total enrolment during 1961 was 95 which includes locally born students being taught in the vernacular. The practical instruction given includes:—Fitting, Motor and Diesel Mechanics, Welding and Blacksmithing. On the theoretical side are included: Theory of Mechanics, Workshop practice, Electricity, Mathematics and Machine Drawing.

(e) There is one Teacher Training Centre which has an enrolment of 101 students. The medium of instruction is Malay and English is taught as a subject.

Recurrent expenditure on Education in 1961 was $6,057,330 compared with $36,059 in 1940. Capital expenditure for 1961 was $595,164.

Health

The population of the State of Brunei is comparatively healthy for a Far Eastern country. This is attributable to the relative prosperity of the State due to its oil revenue, and the fact that its small geographical area facilitates the provision of medical services and makes possible the control of diseases such as yaws, malaria and tuberculosis. Yaws has been eliminated by the widespread use of penicillin, the residual insecticide house spraying which is carried out annually has reduced the number of cases of malaria to less than fifty in a year and there are signs that the campaign against tuberculosis, which was started in 1958, will within a few years bring this disease under control.

The health of the school children is quite good, but there is evidence that amongst pre-school children considerable malnutrition exists, deficiencies of protein and vitamin A being particularly noticeable. A school feeding scheme using fortified flavoured skimmed milk has been in progress for nearly three years.

In 1961 the birth-rate was 51·8 per 1,000, the death rate 7·19 per 1,000 and the infant mortality rate had dropped to 47·7 per 1,000 live births. The maternal and child welfare staff have to contend with much prejudice against new methods of midwifery and child care and a reluctance on the part of the local people to relinquish the old customs that are associated with these matters. An effort is being made this year to provide additional protein and vitamin A for children of the 1–6 year age group.

The Health Department has been expanding its work in connexion with environmental sanitation and municipal and port health activities and the registration and compilation of statistics.

There are two Government Hospitals in the State, one of 187 beds in Brunei Town and one of 75 beds in Kuala Belait. They are both overworked, and provide facilities for the diagnosis and treatment of medical, surgical and obstetric cases. The rural population is served by district dispensaries three of which now have beds for short-stay patients and travelling dispensaries by road and river.

There is an expanding dental service, which provides for the treatment of adults, with laboratories for prosthetic work, there is also a school dental service staffed by two New Zealand Sisters and locally recruited dental nurses who have been trained in the Federation of Malaya.

The Brunei Shell Petroleum Company provide a hospital of 120 beds, with out-patient and consultant services for their employees on the Oilfield at Seria.

Some statistics for 1961 were:

Hospital In-patients | ... | 6,718
Hospital Out-patients | ... | 243,705
Travelling dispensary attendances | ... | 22,063
During 1961 the Medical Department budget amounted to $3,497,976.

Communications

Malayan Airways maintain a daily service to and from Singapore using Viscount and Dakota aircraft, and Borneo Airways maintain local services to centres in Borneo using Dakota and Twin Pioneer aircraft. The airfield at Brunei Town is 6,300 feet long.

The Brunei Shell Petroleum Company have a private grass airfield 6,000 feet long at Anduki. This is used by their Prince aircraft to provide communication to the Malayan Airways service at Brunei Town or Labuan. There is also a light railway about eight miles long from the oilfield to Badas, the source of water for the oilfield, Kuala Belait and Seria.

There are 284 miles of roads of which 136 are bitumen surfaced; earth roads and bridle paths approximately 148 miles.

The main ports are Brunei Town and Kuala Belait. The bulk of general cargo for Brunei is transhipped from Singapore and Labuan and conveyed to the two main ports by coasting vessels operated by the Straits Steamship Company and the Sarawak Steamship Company. Weekly visits are made to the Port of Brunei Town direct from Singapore by the former Company's vessels of up to 800 net registered tons.

Tramp vessels, mainly under Panamanian registration and operated from Hong Kong, visit the port as required with small amounts of general cargo. The Brunei Shell Petroleum Company also maintains a considerable fleet of vessels and these ply mainly between Brunei Town, Labuan and Kuala Belait. In addition, numerous native-owned motor launches, tongkangs and outboard motor boats carry on a coastal trade around Brunei and adjacent Colonies' ports. The State runs a motor launch service three times a week to Labuan, carrying mail and passengers.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is engaged in agriculture. The Government service and oil mining are the largest employers of labour.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are padi, rubber and sago and the main product crude oil from the Seria field, which produced 4,511,000 tons in 1960.

In 1961 the livestock population was: cattle (including buffaloes) 17,000 head, pigs 9,460, poultry 289,000 and goats 2,100.
