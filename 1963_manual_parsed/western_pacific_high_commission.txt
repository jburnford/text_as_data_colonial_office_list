WESTERN PACIFIC HIGH COMMISSION

(Administrative headquarters: Honiara, British Solomon Islands.)

The office of High Commissioner for the Western Pacific was created by the Western Pacific Order in Council of 1877. The High Commissioner's jurisdiction extends over all islands in the Western Pacific not administered by Australia, New Zealand, Fiji or any other civilized power. By the Pacific Order in Council of 1893 the High Commissioner's jurisdiction is extended to foreigners and (in most cases) to natives residing in British settlements or protectorates within the limits of the Order. Under the New Hebrides Order in Council, 1922, the High Commissioner's jurisdiction also extends to the New Hebrides and the Banks and Torres Islands. The expenses of the High Commission are met by the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony and the British Solomon Islands Protectorate; but a contribution is paid from United Kingdom Funds in respect of expenses of the British Service in the New Hebrides.

The High Commissioner's Court consists of the High Commissioner, the Judicial Commissioners and the Deputy Commissioners; and in it is vested all Her Majesty's civil and criminal jurisdiction exercisable in the Western Pacific Islands. The Chief Justice of Fiji, and every other judge for the time being of the Supreme Court of Fiji, is by virtue of his office a Judicial Commissioner. Deputy Commissioners are appointed by the High Commissioner on behalf of Her Majesty. A Judicial Commissioner's Court has powers similar to those of the superior courts of England; and the Deputy Commissioners have civil jurisdiction in common law, equity and bankruptcy, with a limited jurisdiction in probate, and have a criminal jurisdiction in respect of offences not punishable with seven years' penal servitude or upwards. Appeals lie to the Fiji Court of Appeal in cases where the jurisdiction of the High Commissioners' Court has been exercised by a Judicial Commissioner. In addition to other means of preserving order the High Commissioner has certain special powers for the deportation of persons who endanger the peace of the islands.

The Western Pacific (Courts) Order in Council, 1961, was made on the 2nd of August 1961 and brought into operation by proclamation in British Solomon Islands Protectorate on 9th April 1962, in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony and the Central and Southern Line Islands on 18th April 1962, and in the New Hebrides, in relation to, and to the extent of Her Majesty's jurisdiction therein, on 18th April 1962. It provides for the continuation and reconstitution of the High Commissioner's Court as the High Court of the Western Pacific, with posts for a Chief Justice and other Judges in substitution for the present posts of Judicial Commissioners. The Order in Council provides, however, for the continued exercise of the summary jurisdiction of the Deputy Commissioners until other provisions have been made for the constitution of magistrates' courts with civil and summary criminal jurisdiction.

By Orders in Council of 1952 the High Commissioner's responsibilities in respect of the Kingdom of Tonga and the Island of Pitcairn were transferred to the Governor of Fiji with effect from the 1st April 1952.

The groups at present under the High Commissioner are:

- The Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony (including the Phoenix and Northern Line Islands groups).
- The British Solomon Islands Protectorate.
- The New Hebrides.
- The Central and Southern Line Islands.

Particulars of these are given below.

The posts of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific and the Governor of Fiji, which for many years had been held conjointly, were separated on the retirement of Sir Brian Freeston in 1952; and arrangements were made to transfer the Headquarters of the Western Pacific from Suva, where they had been since the creation of the post of High Commissioner (except in 1880–82 when Sir Arthur Gordon combined the posts of Governor of New Zealand and High Commissioner for the Western Pacific) to Honiara in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. The High Commissioner established his headquarters at Honiara on 1st January 1953 and took over responsibility for the direct administration of the Protectorate from the Acting Resident Commissioner on the same date.

BRITISH SOLOMON ISLANDS PROTECTORATE

Area

The Protectorate is enclosed within an area of approximately 249,000 square nautical miles, of which about 11,500 square miles are land.

Population

The results of the sample census taken in November 1959 are now available:

| Europeans | : | : | 850 |
| Polynesians | : | : | 5,000 |
| Chinese | : | : | 400 |
| Melanesians | : | : | 123,000 |
| Others | : | : | 750 |

Grand Total 130,000

Principal Town

Honiara, the capital, is on the island of Guadalcanal and has a native population of 2,805. Europeans number approximately 360, Chinese approximately 260.

Geographical Features

The Protectorate consists of a double row of mountainous islands situated between the parallels of 5° and 12° 30' S., and the meridians of 155° and 170° E. and includes the islands of Guadalcanal, Malaita, San Cristobal, New Georgia, Santa Ysabel, Choiseul, Mono (or Treasury), Shortlands, Vella Lavella, Ranongga, Simbo, Gizo, Rendova, Kolombangara, Russell, Florida, Rennell, and numerous small islands (Lord Howe Group or Ontong Java, the Santa Cruz Islands, Vanikoro, Tikopia, Mitre Island and the Duff and Reef Groups, etc.).

Climate

This is not regarded as unhealthy. The introduction of modern anti-malarial drugs has considerably reduced the dangers of this disease. The seasons are generally well defined by trade winds. The south-east season lasts from April until November when the minimum temperatures are recorded. The highest mean and maximum temperatures and the highest rainfall are, as a rule, recorded in the north-west season from November to April.

History

The Solomon Islands were discovered in 1568 by Alvaro de Mendana, while on a voyage of discovery from Peru. Tasman discovered the Ontong Java group in 1643, and in 1767 Captain Carteret re-discovered the Santa Cruz group and the north-west coastline of the island of Malaita. From this time many Europeans visited the group and British ships of war paid periodical visits.

Between 1860 and 1893 the number of resident white traders gradually increased, until at the time of the proclamation in 1893 of the British protectorate over the southern Solomon Islands (Guadalcanal, Savo, Malaita, San Cristobal, the New Georgia group and its dependencies) the number of white residents approached 50. In 1898 and 1899 the islands of the Santa Cruz group, including Utupua, Tikopia, Vanikoro, the remote islands of Cherry and Mitre, Sikaiana, and the islands of Rennell and Bellona were added to the Protectorate. In 1900 the northern islands (Santa Ysabel, Choiseul, the islands of the Shortland group and the atoll group of Ontong Java) were transferred under convention from Germany to Great Britain.

In 1942 Japanese troops invaded the islands. Most of the non-native population had been evacuated to Australia but the Resident Commissioner and a number of his officers remained to continue the Administration as far as possible. The Japanese occupied the central Solomons and were driven back by the Allies only after violent air, sea and land battles in 1942 and 1943; they were not completely dislodged from the north-western extremity of the Protectorate until the surrender of Japan. The effect upon the population of contact with the very large numbers of Allied servicemen in occupation of the islands and based there for operations further afield, was great and disruption of native life was inevitable.

An outstanding feature of the war and the enemy invasion of the territory was the great loyalty of the native people to their British connexion and to the Allied cause generally.

Constitution

On 18th October 1960 a new Constitution for the Protectorate, embodied in the British Solomon Islands (Constitution) Order in Council, 1960, was brought into operation and provided for the establishment of a Legislative Council and an Executive Council.

The Legislative Council is ordinarily presided over by the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific as President, and consists of three ex officio members, not more than eight Official members and not more than ten Unofficial members. Of the Unofficial members six are at present Solomon Islanders. The Legislative Council therefore, has an official majority. The Official and Unofficial Members are all appointed by the High Commissioner at his discretion.

The Executive Council consists of three ex officio members, who are the Chief Secretary,
the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary, and one Official and four Unofficial members appointed by the High Commissioner.

Legislation is ordinarily made by the High Commissioner with the advice and consent of the Legislative Council.

Land Policy

A Land and Titles Ordinance has been enacted and will be brought into force early in 1963. It continues to restrict the alienation to non-natives of land held under systems of native customary tenure and permits the owners of such land, if they so wish, to obtain registered title to their land. The Ordinance provides for vacant land, after adjudication if vacancy is contested, to be acquired and vested in a Land Trust Board. Under the Ordinance a certain number of Solomon Islanders must be members of this Board.

Taxation

Income Tax is levied at the rate of 9d. increased by .012d. for every £ of chargeable income up to £5,000, and 5s. 9d. on every £ of chargeable income over £5,000. When the chargeable income of any person other than a company exceeds £2,000 a surtax is levied at the rate of 1s. 3d. per £ on incomes between £2,000 and £3,000, 2s. 6d. per £ on incomes between £3,000 and £5,000 and on a sliding scale rising to 10s. 0d. per £ on chargeable incomes in excess of £30,000. Companies pay 1s. 6d. in the £ on chargeable income, except for shipping companies and insurance companies, which pay 4½d. and 9d. in the £ respectively.

Natives pay tax at rates varying from 5s. to £5 per annum, according to the areas in which they reside.

Customs duties represent the chief source of revenue from indirect taxation.

Public Finance

| Year | Revenue (£A) | Expenditure (£A) |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1957 | 1,189,194   | 1,159,348       |
| 1958 | 1,355,489   | 1,373,774       |
| 1959 | 1,504,828   | 1,489,313       |
| 1960 | 1,606,793   | 1,618,778       |
| 1961 | 1,716,795   | 1,702,665       |

In 1961 £A506,000 (est.) of ordinary revenue was derived from Customs duty and £A67,000 (est.) from direct taxation. In the same year, the main heads of ordinary expenditure were:

- Works (Extraordinary): £A208,500*
- Marine Department: £A192,000*
- Medical Department: £A139,080*
- Development: £A394,000*

* Estimated.

There is no Public Debt in the Protectorate. Provision is made for a grant by Her Majesty's Government in aid of the Administration, which in 1961 was £A470,880.

Currency

The currency is Australian. This is interchangeable with sterling at £Stg.1 = £A1 5s. 0d.

Development Plans

In the period 1955–60 a development plan was implemented involving expenditure of the order of £A1,770,000.

The new Protectorate Development Plan covering the years 1960–31st March 1964 is designed to broaden the basis of the economy and to provide basic services adequate to the needs of the Protectorate. Total expenditure to the order of £A2,183,243 has been planned, allocated as follows:

- Natural Resources: 36%
- Communications: 25%
- Social Services: 26%
- Miscellaneous: 13%

Particular emphasis is being placed on the establishment of cocoa as an export crop and some 3,000 acres have been planted.

Among proposed sources of finance for the 1960–64 Development Plan are £A1,012,674 from the Protectorate territorial allocation of Colonial Development and Welfare funds, £A121,000 from the Japanese Reparations Account and £A200,373 from Protectorate funds.

Education

Education at the primary level is mainly in the hands of the Missions. Government subsidies are paid to Missions complying with certain qualifications; the subsidy to Mission schools in 1961 was £A13,334. In 1961 there were five Government primary schools and one secondary boarding school. There were approximately 400 pupils in these schools. In addition there were 301 registered Mission and Local Authority schools with about 13,054 pupils. Two-year courses for teachers and carpenters began in January 1959 at the British Solomons Training College. All of the teacher trainees at the College have so far been trained as Primary Junior teachers, Standards I–IV. The intake of teacher trainees was increased in 1960 from 20 to 24: the four additional places were intended for teachers to be trained for local Council schools. Fourteen carpenters were on the first carpentry course and a similar number were on the second course due to end in November 1962. Some of these will work for Government, others for Missions, and others for private enterprise.

Expenditure on education during 1961 was:

- By missions (estimated): £A116,084
- By Government (from Protectorate funds): £A26,807
- From Colonial Development and Welfare Funds: £A39,193

Libraries and Museums

There is a small museum in Honiara. A library is maintained by an independent club of subscribers.

Health

The principal endemic diseases are malaria, tuberculosis, hookworm and leprosy.

Apart from the Central Hospital in Honiara, which has accommodation for 140 patients, and the Government Leprosarium at Tetere (100 patients), district hospitals are situated at Auki, Gizo and Kira Kiria, and rural hospitals at Malu'u and Tetaba, Santa Ysabel. There are also 67 health clinics and 22 maternity and child health centres.

The various Mission authorities also contribute largely to health matters in the Protectorate, there being two Mission Hospitals, each in charge of a Medical Officer, situated at Munda and Fanabu.
An anti-Yaws campaign was carried out in 1958 by the Medical Department with the assistance of W.H.O. and UNICEF. In 1961 the surveillance phase of the campaign continued and out of nearly 40,000 persons re-examined only 151 infectious cases were found, the majority in well defined local areas on the island of Malaita.

A sister tutor is running courses at the Central Hospital to train Solomon Island nurses, under the auspices of the World Health Organisation.

A pilot project for a malaria eradication scheme has been carried out on the island of Ontong Java (Lord Howe) and results to date indicate that a lowering of the transmission rate had been achieved. An eradication pilot project began in October 1961 with the arrival of the W.H.O. project leader. Intensive training of local staff as technicians and squad leaders took place at the same time as a geographical reconnaissance of the selected areas, the islands of Guadalcanal and New Georgia. In the last quarter of 1962, spraying operations will begin on Guadalcanal.

The expenditure of the Medical Department in 1961 was £A145,670.

Communications

The airfields used by commercial aircraft are at Henderson Field, Guadalcanal, at Yandina Airstrip in the Russell Islands, and at Munda in New Georgia. Trans-Australian Airways operate a weekly service via Port Moresby and Lae from Sydney.

An air service linking the Protectorate with the New Hebrides and Fiji was inaugurated in November 1961 and from March 1963 this service would operate once weekly in each direction. An internal air service was expected to begin operating, under private enterprise, in January 1963. The first airfield built specially for this service has been constructed at Auki, Malaita.

Wireless communication with Tarawa, Vila, Sydney and Suva, Fiji, is maintained by the Government station, Honiara, for the transmission and reception of overseas telegrams. In addition there is a limited wireless telephone schedule between Honiara and Sydney four times weekly.

There are 36 miles of motorable road with a rolled coral surface, extending east and west of Honiara on Guadalcanal and 9 miles of motorable road, which are being extended, on Malaita.

Messrs. Burns Philp and Company, Ltd., operate a freight and passenger service to the Protectorate via the New Hebrides from Sydney at intervals of approximately six weeks; the Australia-New Guinea Line operates a similar service direct from Australian ports. The Australian West Pacific Line and the China Navigation Company operate a freighter service between Hong Kong and Sydney calling at Honiara monthly on the southward journey only. The Rotterdam Lloyd Line and the Bank Line also operate regular monthly services from the United Kingdom and the Continent. Bank Line vessels also call at intervals of six weeks to load copra. Fuel products are shipped in small tankers from New Guinea.

The chief ports in the Protectorate are Honiara, Yandina and Gizo. The Protectorate Government owns and operates 15 small vessels for inter-island communications and administrative and medical touring, and one small fishing vessel. There is a considerable number of privately owned vessels in the Protectorate.

Broadcasting

A one-hour daily broadcast on 1,030 k/cs. was inaugurated in 1952 and in 1955 a simultaneous shortwave transmission on low power (100 watt) was begun on 5,960 k/cs.

A Colonial Development and Welfare Scheme for the expansion of broadcasting was approved in 1957. Studio and transmitter buildings have been constructed and new equipment, including a 660 watt medium wave and a 5 kW. shortwave transmitter, has been installed. The Solomon Islands Broadcasting Service (callsign VQO and VQO.2) transmits daily from 0800 to 1115 hours GMT on weekdays and from 0900 to 1115 hours GMT on Saturdays and Sundays. There is a half-hour broadcast for schools each Monday morning.

Principal Occupations

Most of the indigenous population is engaged in agriculture, either in village gardens or in the copra industry. They are under no economic necessity to work for wages. In 1961 the total number employed was estimated at 8,500 of whom 3,011 were employed on agricultural estates.

A Labour Office was established on 1st January 1959 and a Commissioner of Labour assumed duty in November 1959.

The first Trade Union in the Protectorate, the British Solomon Islands Workers' Union, was registered on 14th July 1961. It has approximately 2,000 members.

Main Crops and Products

The principal crop grown for export is coconuts; cocoa is developing rapidly, being planted by both Solomon Islanders and Europeans. Crops grown for local consumption include yams, sweet potatoes, taro and other roots, canarium almonds, cassava, rice, groundnuts, maize, bananas, pineapples and market garden vegetables.

A rough estimate of the livestock population is 10,000 pigs, 3,000 cattle, 300 goats and 100 horses.

Trade

The chief export is copra which is mainly shipped to the United Kingdom. Total exports of copra in 1958 were 20,437 tons valued at £A1,481,339; in 1959 21,043 tons valued at £A2,196,896; in 1960 19,460 tons valued at £A1,562,818; in 1961 26,081 tons valued at £A1,696,192.

| Year | Imports | Exports | Re-exports |
|------|---------|---------|------------|
| 1957 | £A1,508,903 | £A1,547,221 | £A64,321 |
| 1958 | £A1,646,114 | £A1,825,828 | £A89,577 |
| 1959 | £A1,554,741 | £A2,436,951 | £A69,236 |
| 1960 | £A1,862,349 | £A1,792,995 | £A66,083 |
| 1961 | £A2,045,633 | £A1,866,484 | £A46,350 |

(Including bullion and specie.)

Imports are mainly foodstuffs and trade goods from Australia.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The British Solomon Islands Protectorate Copra Board, which has agents at the main ports, purchases all copra from producers and sells it overseas. A small staff exists under a Registrar of Co-operative Societies to introduce the Solomon Islander to co-operative methods for economic development. The first co-operative society was
formed in 1957 and there are now 38 primary societies and two secondary organizations. Most are at present concerned with the marketing of copra and the distribution of consumer goods.

THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN LIN ISLANDS

These consist of Flint, Caroline, Vostock, Malden and Starbuck, and are administered direct by the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific, formerly under Article 6 of the Pacific Order in Council, 1893, and more recently in accordance with instructions issued by the Secretary of State in 1903, under Article 4 of the Order in Council.

Flint Island was discovered in 1801 but continued search has failed to elicit the name or nationality of the discoverer. Since 1872 it has been worked for guano and copra, with interruptions, by various British companies under licence issued by the High Commissioner. In 1951 it was leased to Mr. T. A. Bambridge of Tahiti.

Caroline Island was discovered in 1705 by Captain W. R. Broughton of H.M. Sloop Providence and it has been worked by various British companies since 1846. It is now leased, with Flint, to Mr. T. A. Bambridge.

Vostock Island was discovered by Captain Bellinghausen, the Russian explorer, during his expedition to the South Pacific and Antarctic in 1820 and has been worked sporadically by British companies for guano and copra since 1873. It is now unoccupied and unworked.

Malden Island was discovered by Lord Byron, Captain of H.M.S. Blonde, in 1825, after conveying the remains of the King and Queen of the Sandwich Islands back to Honolulu from England for burial. Its guano deposits were worked by an Australian company from approximately 1860 to 1927. It is now unoccupied and unworked.

Starbuck Island was discovered in 1823 by Captain Starbuck, of the whaler L'Aigle owned by a London company. It was first worked for guano by a British company during the eighteen-sixties. Attempts to plant coconuts on the island failed and since 1920 it has been unoccupied and unworked.

GILBERT AND ELICE ISLANDS COLONY

Area

The area is approximately 369 square miles, comprising 37 islands spread over more than 2,000,000 square miles of water.

Population

Population was 36,000 at the 1947 census: Gilberts 27,824; Ellice 4,487; Phoenix 984; Northern Line 469; Ocean 2,060. By races the population comprises: Micronesians 29,923; Polynesians 5,066; others, including Europeans, 1,011. The latest estimate (end of 1961) is 47,508.

Principal Islands

The principal islands (and their estimated populations at the end of 1961) are:

Ocean Island—District Headquarters 2,564
Tarawa—Colony and District Headquarters, Gilbert and Ellice Islands 7,061
Funafuti—District Headquarters, Ellice Islands Sub-District 589
*Canton Island—District Headquarters, Phoenix Islands 181$
†Fanning Island 521
Christmas Island—District Headquarters, Line Islands 479$

* Canton Island (and Enderbury Island) are under joint Anglo-American administration; the former is an international airport.

† Fanning Island has a relay station on the trans-Pacific cable operated by Cable and Wireless Limited.

$ Excluding U.S. nationals.

§ Excluding service personnel.

Geographical Features

With the exception of Ocean Island (which is an atoll raised by volcanic action some 200 feet above its original level) the islands are all coral atolls, some with lagoons and some without. There are 16 atolls in the Gilbert Group, nine in the Ellice, eight in the Phoenix and three in the Northern Line Islands.

Climate

The driest months are August to October and the wettest December to February, when northeasterly and westerly storms occur. The southern Gilberts, Phoenix and Christmas Island (Line) suffer from periodic droughts which have an approximate cycle of seven years. Rainfall varies from 100 inches annually in the northern Gilberts through 40 inches in the southern up to 120 inches in the Ellice Islands. In the Phoenix Islands the average rainfall is about 50 inches and in the Line from 30 inches on Christmas Island up to 150 on Washington. The day temperature varies between 80° and 90° throughout the year and the minimum night temperature is about 70°. The trade winds keep the air cool and humidity is not high, except during the rainy season.
History

It is thought that two of the Gilbert Islands and two of the Ellice Islands were sighted by 16th century Spanish navigators. The discovery of the remaining islands had to await the arrival of trading vessels and whalers in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The Gilbert and Ellice groups were brought under the jurisdiction of the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific in 1877 and a Protectorate was established in 1892 when H.M.S. Royalist visited them. Ocean Island was annexed in 1900, and in 1915 the Gilbert and Ellice Islands were annexed by an Order in Council of 10th November. The Order came into effect on 12th January 1916 from which date the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Protectorate became a Colony. In the same year the boundaries of the Colony were extended to include Ocean, Fanning and Washington Islands; in 1919 Christmas Island; and in 1937 the Phoenix Islands.

Constitution and Administration

Local governments are established on islands with indigenous populations in the Gilbert, Ellice and Phoenix groups. They are supervised by District Commissioners responsible through the Resident Commissioner to the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific. These governments, under a constitution introduced in 1941, and amended in 1955, consist of a representative Council with an unofficial majority which exercises minor legislative and executive authority; a Court with criminal and civil jurisdiction over persons of pure and mixed Pacific Islands extraction; and a Lands Court which operates customary law under a Native Lands Ordinance. Since 1958 Island Councils have been able to make their own estimates of revenue and expenditure. Because of the scattered nature of the territory, the local governments have considerable freedom from direct supervision. Until 1962, non-native residents of the Colony were subject to Colony and English law enforceable in the High Commissioner's Court established under the Pacific Order in Council, 1893. However, under the Western Pacific (Courts) Order in Council 1961, applied to the Colony in 1962, there is now established the High Court of the Western Pacific, a superior Court of Record with jurisdiction similar to that of the High Court of Justice in England. Under transitional arrangements, Deputy Commissioners will continue to exercise summary jurisdiction within the High Commissioner's Court until such time as Magistrates' Courts can be established.

Land Policy

The alienation of land to non-natives is forbidden and leases may not be taken out without the consent of the Resident Commissioner or, if the lease is to be for a period in excess of 99 years or for an area exceeding five acres, without the approval of the High Commissioner. Very little land is owned by non-natives (acquired before annexation) or by the Crown.

Taxation

Income Tax is levied at the rate of 9d. increased by .012d. for every £ of chargeable income up to £5,000 and 5s. 9d. on every £ of chargeable income over £5,000. When the chargeable income of any person other than a company exceeds £2,000 a surtax is levied at the rate of 1s. 3d. per £ on incomes between £2,000 and £3,000, 2s. 6d. per £ on incomes between £3,000 and £5,000 and on a sliding scale rising to 10s. 0d. per £ on chargeable incomes in excess of £30,000. Companies pay 1½% on all chargeable income, except for shipping companies and insurance companies, which pay 4½d. and 9d. in the £ respectively.

Landowners tax is paid by all landowners and is based upon land productivity and size. A new system of individual assessment by the local government was introduced in 1958.

Import duties, royalties on phosphates and export (copra) duties are the other main forms of taxation.

Public Finance

| Year | Revenue (£A) | Expenditure (£A) |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1957 | 370,486     | 483,314         |
| 1958 | 504,401     | 476,577         |
| 1959 | 663,916     | 589,335         |

| 1961 | 722,121     | 714,231         |

In 1961 £A168,498 of ordinary revenue was derived from import and export duties, £A326,793 from phosphate royalties, £A16,688 from posts and telegraphs and £24,137 from direct taxation. In 1961 the main heads of expenditure were as follows:

| Item               | Expenditure (£A) |
|--------------------|------------------|
| Medical            | 65,088           |
| Marine             | 98,923           |
| Works              | 127,506          |
| Education          | 37,518           |
| Wireless           | 23,585           |
| District Administration | 23,714       |
| Appropriations to Reserves | 75,000     |

Currency

Australian currency is used in the Colony. Exchange rates fixed in 1949 are:

- £1 Sterling = £A1.5s. 0d.
- £1 New Zealand = £A1.5s. 0d.
- £1 Fiji = £A1.2s. 6d.

Development Plans

The current Colony Development Plan is designed to run from 1959 to 1964 in which period it is proposed to spend £A528,718 on development projects. Of this sum £A135,889 will be met from Colony funds and the remainder from Colonial Development and Welfare funds. The Development plan includes provision, inter alia, for the improvement of reef passages, agricultural and fisheries development, improvement of island dispensaries, an anti-tuberculosis campaign and training schemes and overseas education. Part of the cost of a new Colony vessel will also be borne by Colonial Development and Welfare funds.

Education

At 31st December 1961 there were 10,570 children between the ages of 6 and 16 receiving primary education. Twenty-seven primary schools are maintained from Colonial and local Government funds and 211 are grant-aided. At Tarawa the Government maintains secondary boarding schools for boys and girls with 147 pupils proceeding to higher education. Seventeen students were taking various post-primary and professional courses in Fiji and New Zealand, funds being provided partly by Government grants and partly
from Colonial Development and Welfare funds. Locally twenty students were being trained as teachers under a Colonial Development and Welfare Scheme. Government expenditure on Education in 1961 was £A37,518 compared with £A32,196 in 1960 and £A3,849 in 1935–36.

**Health**

There is a small hospital on every island with a Dresser in charge. Assistant Medical Officers are stationed at the larger islands. Two General Hospitals provide 233 beds and there is a Cottage Hospital with 16 beds.

Tuberculosis and dysentery are the commonest diseases in the Colony. Leprosy also occurs and there is a small leprosarium at Tarawa. Very few cases of yaws have been observed since the mass campaign against this disease in 1957.

The total expenditure on Health Services excluding building and maintenance of buildings and overseas training in 1961 was £A65,088 compared with £A8,848 in 1935–36.

**Communications**

There is an international airport at Canton Island, the use of which has greatly declined with the advent of jet-fan aircraft. The emergency landing strip at Tarawa is used irregularly; flying-boats occasionally visit Tarawa and can land at several other lagoon islands.

Communications in the Colony are mainly marine; the Colony Government operates two and the Missions operate three small inter-island vessels and the Wholesale Society and various Co-operative Societies four more. Communications overseas are normally by these vessels to Ocean Island; each month several vessels owned or chartered by the British Phosphate Commissioners arrive at Ocean Island from, or leave for, Australia or New Zealand. At irregular intervals one of the inter-island vessels visits Fiji and two or three times a year a ship arrives from Fiji en route for the United Kingdom to load copra at Tarawa and in the Line Islands.

The Government operates 35 radio transmitting and receiving stations with a headquarters station at Tarawa to pass traffic to and from the Colony network, and a VHF network of three stations at Tarawa. Telegraphic wireless contact is direct with Suva, Nandi, Honiara and Nauru. Contact is also maintained with shipping inside and outside the Colony.

**Broadcasting**

Government broadcasts in the Gilbertese and Ellice languages have been transmitted since February 1954 on a frequency of 6,050 kc/s power 2 kW. In 1961 a new transmitter purchased as part of a Colonial Development and Welfare Scheme came into operation. It transmits Gilbertese and Ellice languages, and broadcasts three times a week on frequencies in the medium and short-wave bands. In addition there is a once weekly English language broadcast on the same frequencies.

**Principal Occupations**

Most of the population is engaged in copra production on a subsistence basis. Estimated numbers in other occupations are: Government service 1,020, including 370 part-time Native (Local) Government officials; phosphate mining 1,800; commerce 500.

**Main Crops and Products**

Apart from copra production there is no other crop of commercial value. Sea fishing is excellent but on a small scale. Phosphate of lime is mined at Ocean Island by the British Phosphate Commissioners.

**Trade**

| Year | Total Imports |
|------|--------------|
| 1957 | £A 1,188,780 |
| 1958 | £A 1,072,199 |
| 1959 | £A 1,076,963 |
| 1960 | £A 1,022,096 |
| 1961 | £A 1,384,480 |

In 1939 42% of total imports came from Australia and New Zealand, 35% from other Commonwealth countries and 23% from elsewhere. In 1961 the corresponding figures were 73%, 18% and 9%.

The principal imports are cotton goods, fuel oils, soap, tobacco, building materials and food-stuffs (rice, flour, sugar and tinned meat).

**Principal Exports by Quantity and Value**

| Year | Copra | Phosphate (untreated) |
|------|-------|-----------------------|
| 1938-39 | £A 70,717 tons 8,861 | £A 208,521 tons 297,000 |
| 1960 | £A 828,948 tons 10,455 | n.a. |
| 1961 | £A 368,744 tons 6,187 | n.a. |

**Marketing and Co-operative Organizations**

A Copra Board is responsible for all purchases of copra in the Colony and sales overseas. Internal purchases are made through the agency of the Wholesale Society, a statutory organization, and Co-operative Societies. All imports and sales of retail goods are handled by this Wholesale Society and Co-operatives, which are represented on the Board of Directors of the Wholesale Society. At 31st March 1961 there were 42 co-operative societies (mainly consumer-marketing, but including six consumer societies and three unions) having a total membership of 17,752. The volume of private trading in the Colony is negligible.

THE ANGLO-FRENCH CONDOMINIUM OF THE NEW HEBRIDES

Area
The area, including the Banks and Torres Islands, is estimated at 5,700 square miles.

The largest islands are Santo and Malekula, the former with an area of approximately 1,500 square miles. Other large islands are Efate, Ambrym, Tanna, Erromanga, Epi, Aoba, Pentecost and Maewo; and, in the Banks Group, Gaua and Vanua Lava. There are also some 60 small islands and islets.

Population
Based on information on the indigenous peoples provided by the anti-yaws campaign, the native population at the end of 1960 was estimated at 55,428. The non-native population including persons under the jurisdiction of Britain and France at the same time was estimated to be 4,946, of whom 701 were British nationals or under British jurisdiction.

Principal Towns
The Administrative Headquarters of the Group is in Vila, a town of from 2,000-2,500 inhabitants, on the island of Efate, which has a population of approximately 4,500. In recent years a second township, known as Santo, or Luganville, with a population of about 2,000, has grown up along the Segond Channel on the island of Santo. A manganese mine at Forari on Eastern Efate has a population of about 400 persons.

Geographical Features
The islands are of coral and volcanic formation, with active volcanoes on Tanna, Lopevi and Ambrym. They are almost without exception mountainous, Santo Peak and Tabwebesana on Santo rising to over 6,000 feet, but narrow, cultivable coastal strips are generally present. The group is generally well watered. On the larger islands are several small navigable rivers. There are four good harbours, Vila and Havannah on Efate and Ports Sandwich and Stanley on Malekula.

Climate
The climate is oceanic and moderated by the south-east trade winds which blow between the months of May and October. During the remainder of the year winds are variable and cyclones may occur. High humidity occasionally leads to enervating conditions. Temperatures at Vila vary between 60° and 92° and average rainfall ranges from about 45 inches in the south to about 250 inches in the north, with a mean figure of 81 inches for Vila.

History and Constitution
The New Hebrides were discovered by the Spanish explorer, de Quiros in 1606. The next mention came from the French navigator Bougainville in 1768, and in 1774 Captain Cook visited and charted the greater part of the chain of islands comprising the group. Other early visitors were La Perouse, who is believed to have passed through in 1788, and D'Entrecasteaux who came in search of La Perouse in 1793. In this same year the sighting of the Banks Islands was recorded by Captain Bligh in the course of his open boat voyage to Timor after the mutiny on the Bounty. Last century, before any national eyes were turned on the New Hebrides, a number of British and French missionaries, planters and traders had established themselves, and in 1887, by the Anglo-French Convention of 16th November, the two nations appointed a Joint Naval Commission charged with the protection in the New Hebrides of the lives and properties of the subjects of England and France.

In 1902 Deputy Resident Commissioners were appointed and took up residence in the Territory, and in February 1906 an Anglo-French conference took place in London, and a draft convention was prepared to provide for settlement of land claims and for an arrangement to end the difficulties arising from the absence of jurisdiction over the natives. This was confirmed on 20th October 1906 and established an Anglo-French condominium.

A Protocol, drawn up in London in 1914, to replace the Convention of 1906, was ratified in 1922.

There are three Administrations—the British National, the French National and the Condominium (or joint) Administrations.

Land Policy
As the New Hebrides is not a territorial possession of either power concerned, there are no Crown lands or their equivalent. The whole of the land area of the group is held to belong, or to have belonged until alienated, to the natives. The Protocol regulates the acquisition of unregistered land from natives, and the registration of land claims. It provides for the creation of inalienable native reserves, and for the control of sales of land by natives to non-natives.

Taxation
The main forms of taxation are import duties (17½% ad valorem, with certain exceptions) and duties of from 2½ to 6½% on exports of copra, cocoa, coffee, shell, etc. There is no income tax.

Condominium revenue and expenditure (excluding entirely revenue and expenditure of the British and French National Services) is shown in the following table:

| Year | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| 1957 | 384,013     | 361,399        |
| 1958 | 510,596     | 494,352        |
| 1959 | 549,599     | 466,112        |
| 1960 | 592,409*    | 592,409        |
| 1961 | 593,236*    | 593,236        |

* Includes £44,417 appropriated from reserves to meet hurricane rehabilitation expenses in 1960. Figures for 1961 include £38,809 appropriated from reserves.

The main sources of revenue in 1961 were Import and Export duties £413,539. The main heads of expenditure in 1961 were Public Works £201,556 and Medical £56,625.

Currency
The Anglo-French Protocol of 1914 provides that currency and banknotes of either power shall be legal tender in the Group. The currencies in use are the Australian £ and the New Hebrides franc which has the same rate of exchange as the Pacific franc but is convertible into sterling at the rate of Frs. 200 = £A1. Sterling values are used throughout this chapter.
Development

A joint plan of economic development, to be financed from Colonial Development and Welfare funds and the French counterpart F.I.D.E.S., has been drawn up to cover the period ending 31st March 1964. The Plan is estimated to cost £373,829 and includes a topographical survey (already carried out), the expansion of the agricultural service (with emphasis on extension work), the encouragement of co-operative societies, a geological survey, the rehabilitation of airfields at Vila and Santo and the improvement of other communications. National development plans provide for education and health.

Education

The Condominium Government has no education service but makes an annual subsidy (at present £30,000) to each national administration for education. The British Administration subsidises a small multi-racial primary school at Vila and makes grants from the Condominium subvention to Mission voluntary agencies. The French Government has primary schools at Vila, Santo, Tanna, Aoba, Malekula, Tongoa and Erromango and assists French missions. Village, district and high schools (giving primary education only) are conducted by the British Missions in various places throughout the Group. The training of teachers previously undertaken by individual Missions at a number of centres is being concentrated at the newly established British Central Teacher Training College near Vila which opened in March 1962. The College was built and equipped under a C.D. & W. scheme and is staffed jointly by British Government and voluntary agency tutors.

Libraries

A library consisting of books in both metropolitan languages was opened in the Vila Cultural Centre in March 1962. The Cultural Centre also has a collection of New Hebridean artifacts.

Health

Pulmonary complaints and helminthic infections are important causes of death amongst the natives, but malaria is probably the foremost cause. The yaws control project, which followed the completion of an anti-yaws campaign in 1960 was continued in 1961 and the second resurvey of the population was completed for most of the Group. A limited tuberculin sensitivity survey was undertaken and was followed by immunisation of the negative reactors with BCG.

French Government hospitals and medical aid posts are established at Vila, Santo and Malekula and staffed by French National Medical Officers. Her Majesty's Government subsidizes British mission hospitals in Tanna, Efate and Aoba and maintains its own rural clinics in the Banks and Pentecost. British and French National Medical Officers comprise a Condominium Medical Service providing preventive measures against malaria and epidemics, quarantine control, medical inspection of plantation and other labour and free medical attention to the native population. This joint service is reinforced by New Hebrides Assistant Medical Practitioners trained at the Central Medical School in Suva, most of whom are employed by the British National Service. The joint Administration subsidizes the work of the Mission Medical Services.

Communications

Flying-boat landing facilities exist at both Vila and Santo but no regular flying boat service is now operated. Fiji Airways Ltd. operates a fortnightly service, Suva, Vila, Santo, Honiara and return to Suva where regular services to Australia, New Zealand, America and Britain are provided by Qantas and TEAL. The French company Transports Aériens Intercontinentaux provides a twice-weekly air service to and from New Caledonia whence there are regular services to Australia, New Zealand and Tahiti.

The Public Works Department maintains limited roads on Efate, Santo, Tanna and Malekula. There are, in addition, tracks usable by motor vehicles on some of the other islands.

Shipping services link the New Hebrides with Australia, New Caledonia, Hong Kong, France (via Panama Canal), New Zealand and the British Solomon Islands Protectorate. Small vessels give a frequent but non-scheduled inter-island service.

Telegraphic communication is by direct wireless contact with Honiara, Noumea and Sydney and there is an internal network of telediario stations. There is also a radio-telephone service which operates on a limited basis with Sydney, Honiara and Noumea.

Experiments in broadcasting are being carried out by the Condominium Radio Department.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is employed on plantations and in trading or subsistence agriculture. There are no trade unions although legislative provision exists for them.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are copra, cocoa, coffee, yams, taro, manioc and breadfruit. A large number of cattle are reared by the plantations (exact figures unavailable) and a few sheep are bred for wool. Since the enactment of Joint Regulations on mining, prospecting licences for more than 900 areas have been issued. Manganese mining has been established at Forari on Efate by the Compagnie Francaise des Phosphates de l'Océanie. There are no manufacturing industries in the group.

Subsistence fishing is done by the natives and a plant for the freezing of tuna and bonito commenced operation in 1957. This plant, which is sited on Santo, freezes and packages for export to Japan and elsewhere, fish caught by vessels owned by a Japanese firm working in association with the British Company running the plant. Timber (Kauri pine) is exploited on Aneityum.
