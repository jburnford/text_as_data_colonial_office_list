THE GAMBIA

Area

The total area is 4,003 square miles (Colony 29 square miles, Protectorate 3,974 square miles). St. Mary’s Island, with an area of about 2,500 acres of dry land, is included in the Colony area.

Population

The estimated population at mid-1961 was 287,300 composed as follows:—Bathurst—24,500; Kombo St. Mary—9,600; Protectorate—253,200. In 1961 there were 4,330 seasonal immigrants. The population of Bathurst is African except for a few hundred Europeans, Syrians and Lebanese. The main tribal groups in the Protectorate are:

| Approximate Nos. |
|------------------|
| Mandingo         | 102,000 |
| Fula (all tribal sub-divisions) | 60,200 |

| Jola             | 20,000 |
| Others (of less than 5,000) | 19,000 |

The Principal Towns are—

Colony

Bathurst—capital; population 24,500.

Protectorate

Western Division—Brikama.
Lower River Division—Mansa Konko.
MacCarthy Island Division—Georgetown.
Upper River Division—Basse.

Population in the Protectorate is evenly distributed and there are no towns of over 3,000 inhabitants.

Geographical Features

The River Gambia, some 700 miles in length, flows into the Atlantic by a wide estuary which narrows to two and a half miles between Barra Point and the town of Bathurst on St. Mary’s Island. There are 27 feet of water at the entrance of the river at low tide, and ocean-going steamers drawing not more than 17 feet can at present proceed without trouble to Kuntaur 150 miles up-river. There is no bar to the River Gambia. The country consists of the Island of St. Mary (Bathurst) at the mouth of the River, the adjoining districts of Kombo, and strips of territory on each bank of the River, about seven miles wide for most of their length.

Climate

The Gambia has a long dry season, normally from November to May, which is pleasant with low temperature and humidity due to the effect of the harmattan. Rainfall is confined to the period June to October and averages about 40 inches on the coast, decreasing inland. The dry season climate near the coast is the best in West Africa. Up-river it is much hotter than on the coast especially during the period February to May, after which the heat gradually decreases with the onset of the rains.

History

The Gambia was discovered by the Portuguese in 1455 but they made no lasting settlement. Between 1588 and 1752 Royal Charters were granted to various English merchants to trade with it. French merchants also plied during that period but the right of trade was abandoned to England by France under the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 which guaranteed to the English their possession of Fort James and of the River Gambia, with the exception of a French factory established at Albreda on the north bank of the river. From 1807 to 1816 the general commerce between Great Britain and the Gambia fell off, in part due to the abolition of the slave trade. In 1816 a new settlement was founded on the Island of Banjul by English merchants from Senegal. Banjul was renamed St. Mary’s and its town named after Lord Bathurst the then Secretary of State.

The settlement was subject to the Government of Sierra Leone and was annexed to that Colony by Act of Parliament in 1821. From 1816 to 1822 a Military Commandant, aided by a board of merchants called “The Settlement Court”, administered the Government. From 1822 to 1829 the Commandant governed alone.

In December 1829, the Secretary of State appointed the first Lieutenant Governor “of the settlement of Bathurst and its dependencies in the Gambia”. The laws of Sierra Leone remained in force but the Lieutenant Governor was not accountable to the Officer Administering the Government there.

In 1843 the Gambia was created an independent Colony with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils for the administration of its affairs.

By the charter of 1866 it became a portion of the West African Settlements and continued to be so under the charter of 1874 until it was made a separate Government in 1888.

MacCarthy Island was purchased in 1823; the Ceded Mile was granted by the King of Barra in 1826; and British Kombo was granted by the King of Kombo in the various cessions of 1840, 1850 and 1853. In 1897 the countries of Foni and Jarra, on the south bank of the river, came under British protection. Foreign Kombo was also annexed by the British Government and is now divided into North, South and Central Kombo.

The protectorate system of administration has been established since 1894 and extended from time to time by agreement with the different chiefs concerned until Ordinance No. 7 of 1902 was passed, providing fully for the government of the whole Protectorate, which is now divided into four Divisions and again into Districts. This ordinance has since been superseded by the Protectorate Ordinance, 1935.
Constitution

In July 1961 the Secretary of State agreed to further constitutional changes, and these were embodied in a new Constitution which came into operation in April 1962.

Under the Gambia (Constitution) Order in Council, 1962, the Executive Council consists of the Governor, who is President of the Council; the Premier; eight other Ministers; and the Attorney-General who attends meetings of the Council for the purpose of giving advice.

The Governor attends and presides at meetings of the Executive Council. With certain specified exceptions, the Governor is obliged to act in accordance with the advice of the Executive Council.

The House of Representatives consists of a Speaker, elected by the House; a Deputy Speaker, elected by the House from among its members; Elected members (seven from the Colony and twenty-five from the Protectorate); the Attorney-General who has no vote; two members nominated by the Governor after consultation with the Premier (also without voting rights); and four Chiefs elected by the Chiefs in assembly. The Governor retains the right to attend any meeting and preside thereat.

The Governor retains legislative reserved powers.

Land Policy

Individual ownership of land is recognized in the Colony and there is no restriction on the acquisition of land by non-natives. Freehold interests in Crown lands are not disposed of except in special circumstances and with the sanction of the Secretary of State. A grant of Crown lands for a term of years may be made by the Governor. The normal term is 21 years with an option of renewal for a like term.

Land in the Protectorate is held on native customary tenure from the District Authority for the district in which it is vested. In general, land may not be alienated or leased to non-natives without the consent of the Governor. Except in a few cases, non-native occupation of land is confined to leases for not more than 21 years. Leases of small plots suitable for commercial or industrial purposes may be obtained from the District Authority for the district, with the approval of the Governor. The power to approve is delegated to the Commissioner for Local Government.

Taxation

The main source of public revenue is the Customs tariff, supplemented by "purchase tax".

There are sliding scales of personal income tax which amounts to the following rates on chargeable incomes or total incomes, whichever yields the greater tax (incomes of single persons up to £200 a year and married persons up to £350 a year are free of tax and there are additional allowances for dependants):

| Chargeable income | Average rate of tax in the £ |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| £400              | 6                           |
| £400              | 10                          |
| £400              | 26                          |
| £1,100            | 50                          |
| £8,000            | 100                         |
| remainder         | 150                         |

Total Income

(not applicable to non-residents) £ s. d.
From £151 to £200, inclusive a year .. 1 10 0
From £201 to £250, inclusive a year .. 2 0 0
From £251 to £300, inclusive a year .. 3 0 0
Exceeding £350 at 3d. on every pound of total income.

The Company rate is 9s. in the £. There is no estate duty.

There is a direct tax on inhabitants of the Protectorate known as the District Rate which accrues to the Area Treasuries. The rate at present varies from 40s. in the more rural villages to 55s. in the larger towns. It is based on the "yard" of not more than four houses with thatched roofs. Houses roofed with corrugated iron carry a higher tax in most areas. There are additional rates for lodgers in the "yard" and "strange farmers".

Public Finance

| Year       | Revenue (£) | Expenditure (£) |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1958       | 1,895,000   | 1,962,000       |
| 1959       | 1,538,000   | 1,816,000       |
| 1960       | 1,572,000   | 1,710,000       |
| 1961 (revised estimate) | 1,776,000 | 2,118,000       |
| 1962 (estimate) | 1,602,000 | 2,356,000       |

Development receipts for 1962 are estimated at £738,000 and the estimated expenditure £807,000.

The estimated total recurrent revenue for 1962 was £1,602,000 including the following main heads of revenue, viz.:

- Customs: £755,000
- Direct Taxation: £285,000
- Fees, etc.: £180,000

The estimated total expenditure on departmental services was: £2,356,000.

In the same year the main Receipts in the Development estimates were: £179,000 from the Colony's General revenue balance and Recurrent revenue; Colonial Development and Welfare grants £763,000.

The main Heads of Expenditure were:

- Government Development Schemes: £192,000
- Colonial Development and Welfare Schemes: £780,000

The Public Debt of the Gambia at the end of December 1961 amounted to £238,760, and the Sinking Fund to £108,000.

In view of the worsening financial position and the inevitability of a persistent deficit on current account, the United Kingdom Government agreed to give annual grants-in-aid of administration with effect from 1961.

Currency

The currency in circulation is issued by the West African Currency Board in London. It consists of notes of £5, £1 and 10s.; yellow metal coins of 2s., 1s., and 6d.; cupro-nickel coins of 3d.; bronze coins of 1d. and ½d. The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.
Development Plans

Allocations totalling £2,550,000 have been made available from time to time under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts 1945 to 1959.

The major works carried out under these Acts include:

(i) The Royal Victoria Hospital, Bathurst;
(ii) Bathurst town drainage and land reclamation schemes;
(iii) Bathurst new water supply;
(iv) Bitumenised roads in Bathurst;
(v) New High School, Bathurst;
(vi) Armitage School, Georgetown;
(vii) New primary and post-primary schools;
(viii) New health centres and rural dispensaries;
(ix) New veterinary headquarters;
(x) New staff quarters;
(xi) Oyster Creek Bridge, length 720 ft.;
(xii) Ferry terminals at Bathurst and Barra;
(xiii) First section of the Southern Trunk Road.

Work commenced in 1960 between Brikama and Mansa Konko, where the road will join the Trans-Gambia highway from Dakar to Ziguinchor in Senegal.

Other schemes include research into pest infestation and agronomic problems; agricultural, forestry and veterinary improvements; the rice farm at Sapu; sociological and medical research and reconstruction of roads up country.

A V.H.F. Radio Telephone and Telegraph System was installed during 1961 and 1962 providing telephone facilities between Protectorate towns and Bathurst for the first time. It replaces the existing H.F. Telegraph System. The first station was put in service in November 1961 and it is expected that the complete system will be in service before the end of 1962.

A programme of further development schemes was prepared in 1961.

Education

A White Paper on Government policy was published in January 1961 (Sessional Paper No. 1/1961); this provides for a six-year basic primary course after which pupils are selected by means of a Common Entrance examination either for a Secondary Grammar course leading to School Certificate or a Secondary Modern course of 4 years' duration.

There were over 10,000 pupils attending school in the Gambia in 1962.

In the urban area of Bathurst, primary education is mainly a Government responsibility; there was an enrolment in 1962 of 2,932 pupils in the basic primary classes run by Government, divided amongst 10 schools; eight of these were formerly Mission schools and were taken over by Government under the Local Agreement of 1945; they are now administered by Management Committees on which the former religious authority, Anglican, Methodist, Roman Catholic or Muslim is represented. Fees of 10s. per annum are charged in these schools. The former Roman Catholic schools have retained their senior primary classes (219 pupils), the remainder have been grouped at Crab Island School (see below). There are in addition two private schools (enrolment 419 pupils), run by the Methodist and Roman Catholic Missions respectively as preparatory and Kindergarten schools, at which higher fees are charged.

In the rural area of the Colony there are Government primary schools at Bakau and Serekunda and a grant-aided Roman Catholic Mission school at Kanifing. All these schools provide the basic primary course with additional senior primary classes; the total enrolment is 1,258 pupils.

There are 50 village primary schools in the Protectorate with 4,209 pupils; 36 of these are owned by the District Authorities and staffed mainly by Government teachers. The remainder are Mission Schools (13 Roman Catholic, one Anglican); the salaries of qualified teachers in these schools are reimbursed by Government.

Secondary Grammar education is concentrated mainly in Bathurst where there are three schools. The Gambia High School, opened in 1959, is a mixed school which absorbed the former Methodist Boys' and Girls' High Schools and the Bathurst School of Science. It is an independent non-denominational school administered by a Board of Governors; new school buildings are in course of construction and a Science block has been completed. Sixth Form classes were started in 1960 and the first pupils will be taking Advanced level in the General Certificate of Education in 1962. The Roman Catholic Boys' and Girls' Schools continue as separate schools. Total enrolment in all Secondary Grammar schools was 413 boys and 205 girls in 1962: about 50 pupils are presented for the West African School Certificate each year. The new Government post-primary school at Crab Island has 618 pupils including 212 girls; there is a four-year course. Fees at Secondary Grammar schools are £6 to £9 per annum and at Secondary Modern schools £3 per annum.

Armitage School at Georgetown in MacCarthy Island Division is a post-primary boarding school for Protectorate pupils; it had 157 boys and 23 girls in 1962. Work has now been completed on new buildings for the school, making possible an increased intake of 60 pupils a year, and an enrolment of 240 pupils.

Yundum College, 15 miles from Bathurst, trains both men and women teachers for Government and Mission schools; there is a three-year course, reduced to two years for students who have completed their secondary schooling. There were 117 students including 27 women in 1962 and plans are in hand to enlarge the College to 150 students.

The Technical Trade School in Bathurst provides artisan training for carpenters and metal workers.

There are over 50 Gambians pursuing University courses overseas; 11 of these are at Fourah Bay College in Sierra Leone, 1 is in Ghana and the remainder in the United Kingdom or Ireland. All hold either full Government Scholarships or Bursaries; in addition about 100 private students are following a variety of courses mostly part-time in the United Kingdom.

Government expenditure (recurrent) on education in 1961 was £211,000, representing 10% of total recurrent expenditure.

Health

The most important diseases are malaria, leprosy, tuberculosis, trypanosomiasis, ankylostomiasis, ascariasis, filariasis, trachoma, yaws, tetanus, measles, whooping cough, anaemias, and malnutrition. The Health Service includes mosquito control units at Bathurst, Cape St. Mary, and Yundum Airport. Health Inspectors are posted throughout the Colony and Protectorate.
Medical facilities are based upon two hospitals, at Bathurst and at Bansang, in MacCarthy Island Division. The Royal Victoria Hospital at Bathurst is a well-equipped general hospital, opened in 1953 and having 175 beds. Also in the Bathurst area are a small Sanatorium, a mental hospital, and a Home for the Infirm, also used for long stay cases. Bansang Hospital is a rural hospital of 75 beds, and nearby is a small leprosy village settlement. In 1961 a total of 6,634 in-patients was treated in the two main hospitals, and the out-patient attendances numbered 106,631.

There are eight Health Centres and 41 dispensaries and sub-dispensaries scattered throughout the country. Total attendances at these units in 1961 were 376,415.

Maternity and Child Welfare Clinics are held in Bathurst and at twenty places outside Bathurst. The total attendances at the Child Welfare Clinics in 1961 were 76,602.

A dentist is on the staff of the Royal Victoria Hospital at Bathurst, and in 1961 there were 6,575 attendances at the dental surgery.

A nutrition project is being assisted by W.H.O. and UNICEF. It consists of the issue through the M.C.W. clinics of supplementary rations of skim milk and vitamin capsules (vitamins A and D) to pre-school children, pregnant women and nursing mothers. A total of 1,402,651 daily rations was issued in this way in 1961, representing 78 tons of dried skim milk.

A Leprosy Control Project is being implemented by the Government with the assistance of W.H.O. and UNICEF. Treatment is on an out-patient basis and is available at 50 clinics throughout the country. Mobile treatment circuits were introduced in 1961. At the end of the year 4,135 patients were under treatment.

The estimated recurrent Government expenditure on the Medical and Health Services in 1962 is £239,844, or 10·2% of the total, and the estimated Capital expenditure is £23,746.

Communications

The international aerodrome is at Yundum, 17 miles from Bathurst. The Director of Public Works is also the controller of Civil Aviation and the airport control services are run on behalf of Government by International Aeradio Limited. Meteorological services are provided by a branch of the West African Meteorological Service. Scheduled return flights between Accra and Dakar calling at Bathurst are run by W.A.A.C. (Nigeria) once a week and Ghana Airways once a week. British United Airways operates one return flight each week from Gatwick Airport to Accra calling at Las Palmas (night stop) Bathurst and Freetown.

There are approximately 730 miles of roads in the Gambia excluding district tracks. Of this total 220 miles are to an all-weather standard. The current five-year programme allows for the reconstruction of a further 200 miles to all-weather standard and the provision of bridges and culverts to British Standard Heavy Loading. Main streets in the larger Protectorate trading centres are being bitumenised.

The chief port, Bathurst, handled 121,789 tons of cargo in 1961. Services for passengers and cargo are provided by the Elder Dempster Lines and Palm Line and occasionally by John Holt and Company. River ports are used for the loading of decorticated groundnuts into ocean-going shipping. The H.M.C.S. Lady Wright and the H.M.C.S. Fulladu maintain a weekly service between the main river ports from Bathurst to Basse, a distance of about 242 miles up the Gambia River. The two vessels carried in 1961 a total of 1,151 cabin passengers, 21,596 deck passengers and approximately 3,600 tons of cargo.

There are no railways.

Broadcasting

A broadcasting transmitter station "Radio Gambia" was inaugurated on 1st May 1962, operating on the 60 metre band. It transmits at present on five days a week from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is engaged in agriculture. The estimated numbers in other occupations are:

| Occupation          | Number |
|---------------------|--------|
| Government Service  | 5,640   |
| Building            | 90      |
| Distributive Trades | 5,982   |
| Shipping            | 77      |
| Others              | 404     |

There are three Trade Unions—the Gambia Labour Union, the Gambia Workers Union and the River Trade and Dealers Union (formerly the River Trade and Commercial Workers Union).

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are groundnuts for export (84,000 tons of undecorticated nuts were produced in 1961–62) rice, sorghum and millet; some maize and a little cotton for village weaving are also grown.

The estimated livestock population is: cattle 164,000; sheep 58,000; goats 87,000; pigs 3,000; horses 200; donkeys 4,000; poultry 227,000.

A fair amount of fish is caught in coastal waters and some in the lower river; very little however is done farther up-river, though fish are fairly plentiful. The value of smoked fish exported to Sierra Leone in 1961 was £19,000.

Co-operative and Marketing Organizations

The Gambia Oilseeds Marketing Board handles the export of all groundnuts and other oilseeds. Its aims are to ensure orderly marketing and to improve the quality of exports. The progressive development of Farmers' Marketing Co-operatives continues. The first society was registered in 1956; there are now 72 registered societies which handled 12½% of the 1961-62 groundnut crop.
