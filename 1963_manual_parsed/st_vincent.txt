ST. VINCENT

Area

The total area of the Colony, together with the St. Vincent Grenadines, is 150·3 square miles.

Population

The population at the 1960 (April) Census was 79,948, and was estimated at the end of 1961 to be 81,975.

Principal Town

Kingstown, the capital, has a population of 20,688 including suburbs.

Geographical Features

Geographically the chief feature of St. Vincent is the now inactive volcanic cone, Soufrière (4,048 feet). The island has a maximum length of 18 miles and maximum width of 11 miles. A backbone of thickly wooded mountains extending along the main axis divides the island into windward and leeward districts. The area under forest is approximately 70 square miles. None of the rivers are navigable.

Climate

Temperatures range from 67° to 89° with an extreme maximum seldom over 92° in the shade. At the Kingstown station, 60 feet above sea level, the mean temperature was 82·4° and the rainfall 99·07 inches, in 1961.

History

St. Vincent was discovered by Columbus in 1498. It was included in a patent given by Charles I to the Earl of Carlisle in 1627. In 1660 England and France agreed that the Island should be neutral, but in 1672 Charles II granted it to Lord Willoughby. Shortly afterwards the first people of African origin arrived. They were a number of slaves, shipwrecked in the Grenadines, who eventually reached St. Vincent, and intermarried with the Carib inhabitants. Later, French settlements were made along the leeward coast including the site of the present capital, Kingstown.

By the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, St. Vincent was declared neutral, but was captured by the British fourteen years later in 1762. After the conclusion of peace in 1763, European settlers began to arrive. During the American War of Independence, France declared war on Britain in 1778, and St. Vincent fell into the hands of the French in 1779. With the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 it was restored to Britain.

Constitution

The constitutional arrangements are the same as for Antigua (see page 69) except that provision is made for nine elected members in the Legislative Council.

Taxation

A graduated income tax is imposed on individuals, ranging from 3 cents to 65 cents on every $ of chargeable income. In the case of companies a flat rate of 40 cents on every $ of chargeable income is levied. There are also land and house taxes. The other main forms of taxation are the trade tariffs and excise duty which is levied at present only in the case of locally manufactured spirits, at 18s. 2d. per proof gallon.

In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Medical: $786,251
- Education: $811,582

The Public Debt at 31st December 1961 was $465,741, equivalent to $5·82 per head of the population.

Development Plans

St. Vincent has been allocated the sum of £540,000 ($2,592,000) under the 1959 Colonial
Development and Welfare Act. It is proposed that these funds should be used as follows in the 1960-64 period:

| Category                  | Amount   |
|---------------------------|----------|
| Agriculture, etc.         | £156,273 |
| Public Works              | £253,359 |
| Education                 | £82,100  |
| Medical                   | £31,000  |
| Urban and Rural Rehabilitation | £17,268 |
| **Total**                 | **£540,000** |

**Education**

In 1961 there were two Government secondary schools and two grant-aided secondary schools with an enrolment of 954 pupils and 34 primary schools (Government and assisted) with an enrolment of 21,590 pupils. Primary education was also offered by a number of private institutions. Four Government teacher-training establishments have a total enrolment of 473 pupils.

During 1960-61 some 45 St. Vincent students were attending universities and other places of study in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, Canada, Jamaica and Trinidad.

In 1961 expenditure on educational services amounted to $811,582. The contribution of the United Kingdom under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts was $103,151. In 1935 expenditure purely from local funds was $52,642.

**Health**

Yaws is no longer a public health problem; prompt measures are taken to control individual cases and any sporadic outbreaks. The work of arresting the spread of Tuberculosis progressed with intensified contact finding and follow-up of cured cases. Tuberculin testing and B.C.G. Vaccination of school children in certain age groups were continued. Enteric fever is endemic; malaria and insect-borne diseases are not prevalent.

There are 24 dispensaries. Hospital beds maintained by Government are as follows:

- General (Medicine and Surgery) .. 210
- Tuberculosis and other infectious diseases .. 48
- Mental .. 100
- Leprosy .. 20
- Pauper Home .. 125

In 1961 in-patients numbered 4,400; out-patients, 7,751.

Total expenditure in 1961 on Government Health and Medical Services was $786,251; in 1935 $66,945.

**Communications**

The Seadrome at Villa Bay, about three miles from Kingstown, is no longer in use. An airstrip of 4,800 ft. in a clearway of 500 ft. having a tarmac of 150 ft. wide, has been constructed at Arnos Vale, two miles outside Kingstown. The terminal building was in use at the end of October 1961. British West Indian Airways operate two flights daily, North and South, in and out of Arnos Vale Airport.

There are about 603 miles of road of which some 396 miles are motorable throughout the year; 136 miles of oiled roads for all classes of traffic; 259 miles of metalled roads, besides various tracks.

The chief port is Kingstown. A weekly cargo and passenger service is provided by two ships travelling alternately via the islands as far north as Jamaica and south to Trinidad. From the United Kingdom there is a cargo service monthly by the Harrison Line. Geest Industries Steamships call weekly taking shipments of bananas and a limited number of passengers to the United Kingdom. Monthly cargo and passenger services are provided by the Royal Netherlands Steamer Co., Booth American Shipping Co., Fratelli Grimaldi Line, James Nourse Line, Harrison Line, Atlantic Line, West India Shipping Co., Linea C Line and Saguenay Shipping, Ltd.

Motor vessels and schooners ply an unscheduled trade in the area, going when and wherever cargo is offered.

Motor launches and open boats ply daily between ports on the Leeward coasts and Kingstown. Between the Grenadines and the mainland communication and transport are provided by auxiliary sailing vessels and a tri-weekly motor vessel service on Government Contract.

Construction work on a Deep Water Harbour for the port of Kingstown has commenced and it is expected that it will be completed by the end of 1963.

**Broadcasting**

(See under Grenada—page 126)

There is a sub-station in St. Vincent which broadcasts local news twice daily at 12.40 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. Due to the limited power of the local transmitting set, the local news is only audible within a radius of 9 miles from Kingstown. Efforts are being made to install the necessary equipment so that local broadcasts may be heard throughout the island.

St. Vincent’s contribution for 1962 for running and maintaining the Windward Islands Broadcasting Service was $25,250.

**Principal Occupations**

The working population is estimated to be some 32,000, about 50% of whom are engaged in agriculture, forestry and fishing.

**Trade Unions**

| Name                                      | Membership |
|-------------------------------------------|------------|
| The Federated Industrial and Agricultural Workers’ Union | (not available) |
| The Civil Service Association             | 293        |
| The Teachers’ Association                 | 163        |
| The Secondary School Teachers’ Association | 14         |

**Main Crops and Products**

The main crops in order of importance are bananas, arrowroot, copra, sugar, cotton, sweet potatoes, nutmegs and mace, peanuts, starchy food crops, cocoa and cassava.

A rough estimate of the livestock population is: goats 12,000; cattle 7,000; sheep 14,000; horses and mules 200; swine 10,000.

Sales of trees are restricted to a minimum in order to avoid the building up of a timber trade at the expense of soil and water conservation.

Extensive fishing is done in-shore but very little off-shore. A fisheries scheme has started under which cold storage facilities have been provided. This is situated in Canouan and has led to greatly
increased activity particularly in the well stocked fishing waters of the Grenadines.

The one modern Central Arrowroot Factory is operating. There are some 14 other privately owned mills for the processing of arrowroot and cassava starch; a cigarette factory; a small sugar factory and rum distillery and several small plants producing aerated drinks. The Government Cotton Ginnery was destroyed by fire in November 1959 and has not yet been rebuilt. There is a tyre recapping factory at Arnos Vale.

In 1938 40% of total exports went to the United Kingdom, 22% to other Commonwealth countries and 38% to foreign countries. The corresponding percentages in 1961 were: 55, 31 and 14.

### Principal Exports by Quantity and Value ($ B.W.I.)

| Item   | 1938 | 1960 | 1961 |
|--------|------|------|------|
| Bananas| tons | 1,300| 22,669| 20,758|
|        | $000 | 18   | 2,818 | 2,637 |

|        | $000 | 440  | 1,437 | 1,317 |
| Copra  | tons | 743  | 2,527 | 2,733 |
|        | $000 | 40   | 856   | 913   |

|        | $000 | —    | 104   | 104   |
| Sweet Potatoes | tons | —    | 2,366 | 1,711 |
|        | $000 | —    | 163   | 112   |

### Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

At the end of 1961 there were 14 registered Co-operative Societies with a membership of 1,221 classified as follows: 7 Credit Unions, 2 Marketing and Processing Societies, 4 Fishermen's Societies and 1 Thrift and Credit. These societies have savings amounting to $36,822 and assets totalling $53,756. Loans granted to members during 1961 amounted to $25,611 and repayments totalled $19,742.

The impact of these societies on the economic life of the people is gradually being felt and it is hoped that with increased co-operative education and techniques greater economic and social improvements will result.

The 26 Agricultural Credit Societies which operate under the Agricultural Credit Societies Ordinance cater solely for peasant farmers. Membership at the end of 1961 totalled 1,281 and loans granted amounted to $49,124.

A Statutory Marketing Board has been established to secure the most favourable arrangements for the purchasing, handling, storage, exportation, shipping and marketing of all specified produce of St. Vincent, provided that this shall not apply to produce, the marketing of which is already under the control of some other Statutory Authority. At present under the provisions of the Marketing Board Ordinance, 1959, only sweet potatoes have been declared a "specified product". The Board will eventually deal with the majority of crops but it is proposed to proceed cautiously, making a start with sweet potatoes only, and "specifying" other items gradually in the light of experience.
