NORTH BORNEO

Area

North Borneo, which includes the whole of the northern portion of the island of Borneo, is 29,388 square miles in area or roughly the size of Ireland. It is divided into four Residencies: Sandakan, 9,534 square miles; Tawau, 7,011 square miles; Interior, 7,613 square miles and West Coast, 5,195 square miles. Since October 1955 Labuan Island, 35 square miles, has been administered by a District Officer who is responsible directly to the Chief Secretary, Jesselton.

- European (including Eurasian) . . . . 1,896
- Others . . . . 41,485
- Total . . . . 454,421

Principal Towns

Geographical Features

Central mountain ranges from 4,000 to 6,000 feet in height, rise somewhat sharply from low hills nearer the coast and culminate in Mount Kinabalu (13,455 feet) the highest mountain in the East Indies. The coastline is formed mainly of alluvial flats, with many creeks and swamps. Hills and valleys in most cases are covered with dense forest and there are many rivers. The most extensive plain is that on the east coast,
between the Labuk and the Kinabatangan rivers. In the interior are found the Keningau and Tambunan plains which are traversed by the Pegalan river. The Keningau plain consists of wide stretches of grassland, while Tambunan maintains a large padi-planting population.

Labuan, 35 square miles in area, is an island lying six miles off the mainland. It has an excellent, well-sheltered harbour and during 1956 regained its pre-war status as a free port.

Climate

This is relatively cool for a place situated so near the equator.

Relative humidity is generally high in most places although there are a few comparatively dry belts. The north-east monsoon begins about the middle of October and lasts until March or April; the south-west monsoon prevails from the beginning of May until August. Moderately strong gales are common during the north-east monsoon but Borneo lies outside the typhoon belt.

History

Early in the sixteenth century the Sultan of Brunei was the overlord of the bulk of the territories which now comprise Sarawak, Brunei and North Borneo. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries European intrusion reduced the power of Brunei. An era of lawlessness ensued and by the middle of the nineteenth century piracy had become such a scourge that charts warned merchants against trading in those waters. The Sultan of Brunei offered the island of Labuan to the British Government in 1844 and in accordance with that offer the island was annexed in 1846, the cession being formally agreed to in a treaty with the Sultan in 1847. In 1878, after protracted negotiations, a large area on the mainland was ceded by the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu to Mr. Alfred Dent and his associates, in return for annual payments. The cession conveyed full rights over the territory and was made in perpetuity. In November 1881, the British Government granted a charter to the British North Borneo Provisional Association, Limited, which had taken over the concessions from Mr. Dent and his associates, and the company assumed charge of the territories under the title of the British North Borneo (Chartered) Company in 1882. This Company governed British North Borneo until January 1942, when it fell to the Japanese, and was the last of the chartered companies to administer an area of the British Empire. The territory was liberated by the Australian 9th Division in September 1945 and was under military administration until 15th July 1946 when it became part of the new Crown Colony of North Borneo.

The Island of Labuan, formerly administered as a separate colony from 1846 until 1890 and later as a settlement of the Straits Settlements, also became part of the new Colony of North Borneo on the same date under the Labuan Order in Council.

Constitution

The constitution is regulated by Letters Patent under which a Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Colony is appointed. Under this Instrument all sovereign rights were assumed over the former state of North Borneo and the Settlement of Labuan following the respective North Borneo and Labuan Cession Orders in Council of 1946.

Legislative and Executive Council, in place of the Advisory Council which had existed hitherto, were provided for in 1950 by amending Letters Patent. This Legislative Council was established by Order in Council in 1950 and its constitution was varied by amending Orders in Council in 1960 and in 1961. The Legislative Council now consists of the Governor as President, four ex officio members, three official members and eighteen nominated members. The Constitution of the Executive Council, which is fixed by Royal Instructions, is now four ex officio members, two official members and six nominated members.

In September, the Government accepted a unanimous resolution of the Legislative Council calling for the introduction of a Member System by the end of the year.

Federation of Malaysia

A five-man Commission of Enquiry, under the Chairmanship of Lord Cobbold and with two members each appointed by the British and Malayan Governments, visited North Borneo in the early part of 1962. The Commission whose Report was published in August found unanimously that a Federation of Malaysia was in the best interests of North Borneo and Sarawak and that, provided certain conditions and safeguards could be substantially met, a majority of the people in North Borneo and Sarawak would accept Malaysia. The Commission unanimously recommended that a decision of principle about the future of the territories should be taken as soon as possible.

Following talks in London in July, the Secretary of State for the Commonwealth and Colonies announced that the British and Malayan Governments had accepted almost all the unanimous findings of the Commission and had decided in principle that, subject to the necessary legislation, the proposed Federation of Malaysia should be brought into being by the 31st August 1963; they intended to conclude, within six months, a formal agreement which would provide for the transfer of sovereignty in North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore by the 31st August 1963. Detailed constitutional arrangements including safeguards for the special interests of North Borneo and Sarawak would be drawn up after consultation with legislative bodies in both territories. These safeguards would cover such matters as religious freedom, education, representation in the Federal Parliament, the position of the indigenous races, control of immigration, citizenship and the State constitutions. So that the introduction of the new Federal system could be effected as smoothly as possible and with the least disturbance to the existing arrangements, there would be a transitional period, during which a number of Federal constitutional powers would be delegated temporarily to the State Governments of North Borneo and Sarawak.

In September, the Legislative Council unanimously passed a Resolution welcoming "the decision in principle to establish Malaysia by
31 August 1963, provided that the terms of participation and the constitutional arrangements will safeguard the special interests of North Borneo.

The task of working out the future constitutional arrangements and the necessary safeguards was referred to an Inter-governmental Committee under the chairmanship of the Marquess of Lansdowne, the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs. This Committee held its final plenary meeting in Kuala Lumpur from the 18th to 20th December 1962 and agreed the general terms of its Report.

**Land Policy**

There are two forms of land tenure: leases available to all, and Native Titles available to natives (who include all indigenous inhabitants). No new lease for town or country land (not being a Native Title) may be for more than 99 years. The area opened up by natives (excluding village reserves) is approximately 199,500 acres, almost all on individual title. All unalienated land is the property of the Crown.

**Taxation**

The main form of direct taxation is income tax. The rate applicable to companies, incorporated or registered in the Colony or elsewhere, is as follows:

(a) if they elect to be taxed on undistributed exempt trading profit... 20%
Provided when these profits are distributed a further 20% has to be paid.

(b) on all other chargeable income... 40%

The rates applicable to individuals are from 3½% on the first $12,000 of chargeable income to 20½% on chargeable income in excess of $34,000, 30½% on chargeable income in excess of $44,000 and 40½% on chargeable income in excess of $54,000. Arrangements have been concluded with the Governments of the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden for the avoidance of double taxation.

The other main source of taxation is Customs import and export duties. The highest general rate on imports is 30%, *ad valorem* on cosmetics and perfumery, the preferential rate being 20%. Manufactured goods are usually charged 10% but many items are subject to specific duty rates including, so far as possible, textiles and clothing. Other textiles and clothing are charged 15% with a preferential rate of 7½%. Goods which are not specifically classified in the Tariff are free of duty. There is also a free list of goods which might otherwise be dutiable, but are exempted because of the purposes for which they are to be used; this includes building materials, passengers, personal and household effects etc. Essential machinery and plant of British manufacture is also free of duty. The majority of goods exported are dutiable; 10% of the f.o.b. value is an average charge, but certain items are given special attention, e.g., rubber is charged 5% *ad valorem* when the fixed price does not exceed 60 cents per pound, and on an increasing scale as the fixed price rises, e.g., with fixed price at $1·50 per pound the duty is 17 cents. In fixing the price an allowance of 5 cents per pound against the average Singapore buying price is made. In addition, cesses are levied on all rubber exported; ½ cent per pound for the development of the rubber industry, and 3½% of the price at the date of export subject to a minimum of 2 cents per pound to finance replanting and new planting by estates and smallholders. Most of the timber exported is charged a royalty, but other timber is charged export duty in accordance with the Timber Roll.

To encourage the cultivation of certain crops exemption from export duty has been granted as follows:

- **Cocoa** .. Exemption from export duty up to 1st January 1967.
- **Palm Oil and Palm Kernels** .. Exemption from export duty up to 1st January 1973.

**Public Finance**

From the re-establishment of civil government, following the liberation from Japanese occupation in July 1946, to the end of 1961 local revenue was in excess of recurrent expenditure.

Currency

The currency in circulation in North Borneo is Malayan currency consisting of:

(a) currency notes issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo, dated not earlier than 1st July 1941 in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 cents; and $1, $5, $10, $50, $100, $1,000. Of the above, the notes of denominations of from one to fifty cents are being withdrawn from circulation as and when handed into treasuries but they are still legal tender;

(b) silver coins in denominations of 5, 10, and 20 cents, which are being withdrawn from circulation;

(c) cupro-nickel coins in denominations of 5, 10, 20 and 50 cents;

(d) copper and bronze coins in denominations of one cent.

British Borneo (Chartered) Company currency ceased to be legal tender as from 1st September 1953 but when handed into banks or treasuries is still redeemable at its face value for Malayan currency.

The amount of currency estimated as being in circulation at the end of 1960 was $102,635,889.

The buying and selling rates of the Malayan dollar fluctuate slightly in accordance with the Singapore market, but for the purpose of converting it into sterling, the value of the dollar is taken as 2s. 4d.

Development Plans

In the course of 1959, a broad disposition of the Colony's Development Finance for the period 1959 to 1964 was drawn up. The resources under the Plan have been very considerably expanded since it was formulated because of the availability of substantial revenue balances under the Ordinary Budgets in 1960 and 1961; this has enabled the scope of the Plan to be increased to $109 million by transferring, or assuming the transfer of contributions from the Ordinary Budget to the Development Budget. The revised Plan is based on finance being found from:

| Source                                      | Amount   |
|---------------------------------------------|----------|
| (a) Surplus Colony Funds                    | $71,000,000 |
| (b) Loan Funds                              | $10,000,000 |
| (c) Unspent balances from Colonial Development and Welfare grants from the period ending 31st March 1960 (say) | $260,000 |
| (d) Colonial Development and Welfare grants of £3,000,000 ($25,714,265) | $25,714,265 |
| (e) Accruals from land premia between 1961 and 1964 (say) | $2,000,000 |

$108,974,265

The Plan proposes the expenditure of $109,000,000 on the following broad lines:

| Item                  | Amount   |
|-----------------------|----------|
| Roads                 | $25,968,000 |
| Harbours and Marine   | $6,995,000 |
| Civil Aviation        | $2,584,750 |
| Agriculture           | $2,384,300 |
| Drainage, Irrigation and Reclamation | $2,000,000 |
| Medical               | $2,424,000 |
| Education             | $12,212,100 |
| Credit                | $2,000,000 |
| Building and Miscellaneous | $19,160,000 |
| Water supplies        | $4,650,000 |
| Sewerage              | $1,500,000 |
| Posts and Telegraphs  | $1,966,500 |
| Land                  | $415,000 |
| Broadcasting and Information | $1,000,000 |
| Railways              | $1,000,000 |
| Training              | $698,000 |
| Labuk Valley Surveys  | $1,760,000 |
| Miscellaneous Unallocated | $10,282,350 |
| Contingencies         | $10,000,000 |

$109,000,000

A sum of $10,000,000 has been allocated to a contingencies item which is intended to cover the possibility that Government may ultimately have to find funds to supply credit to certain statutory bodies in excess of $2,000,000 shown against credit facilities and to increase certain allocations which are likely to prove inadequate.

Education

There are 110 Government and 305 grant-aided primary schools and 6 Government and 22 grant-aided secondary schools. Government also maintains a Trade School and a Teachers' Training College. There is also an emergency training centre for the training of rural School Teachers. A number of Adult Evening Classes in science, languages, mathematics, shorthand and bookkeeping are conducted.

Primary education is provided in Malay, Chinese, English and to a very small degree in Kadazan, the language of the largest indigenous community. Secondary education is principally in English.

Sabah College and All Saints' School, both in Jesselton, are the only two schools which at present have a post-certificate course to university matriculation standard. The former has a main bias towards science and the latter towards arts. Eight of the secondary schools provide a full course to Overseas School Certificate. Three Chinese schools provide a full six year course and enter pupils for the Overseas School Certificate. All other secondary schools provide a short three year course toward a local certificate.

In 1962, the enrolment in primary schools was 58,523, of whom 35,792 were boys and 22,731 were girls. This constitutes 70% of the estimated primary age group in North Borneo. There were 5,773 pupils in secondary schools, of whom 3,932 were boys and 1,841 were girls.

The expenditure by the Education Department from Colony funds in 1961 was $4,255,819.
Libraries

There are reference and law libraries in the Secretariat and specialist libraries for teachers are also maintained by the Department of Education in Jesselton and Sandakan.

Public Libraries are maintained in Jesselton, Sandakan, Tawau, Lahad Datu, Labuan, Tuaran, Papar and Kudat with branches in smaller towns. These Libraries are administered by the Department of Broadcasting and Information with the Jesselton Public Library acting as the Central Library for the Colony.

Health

The principal diseases are malaria, pulmonary tuberculosis, acute respiratory infections, intestinal infestations and skin complaints.

There are two general hospitals (523 beds) and 6 cottage hospitals (488 beds). There are also 30 dispensaries situated in outlying districts staffed by senior dressers under the supervision of district Medical Officers. A total of 198 beds are provided at 18 of these dispensaries. During 1961 there were 321,544 new out-patients and 22,327 new in-patients at the institutions mentioned above.

There is a mental hospital at Sandakan with 160 beds.

There are Maternal and Child Health Centres at Sandakan, Jesselton and Keningau, each under the direct supervision of a Health Visitor. Subsidiary rural health clinics (55) are located in various parts of the country. These are visited regularly by maternal and child health staff, and the majority of them serve up-country villages. Rural health nurse/midwives are being trained at Jesselton and in the surrounding rural areas and traditional midwives are also receiving short training courses at hospitals.

Expenditure on medical services from Colony funds in 1961 amounted to $4,596,066.

Communications

There are in North Borneo 15 civil aerodromes of which 10 are Government owned and operated; and 5 military aerodromes.

External communications are provided from Jesselton which is served by Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. DC6B services to Hong Kong and Manila and Malayan Airways Ltd. Viscount and DC3 services to Brunei, Sarawak and Singapore.

Internal communications are provided by Borneo Airways Ltd. from their base at Labuan. Daily services using DC3 or Twin Pioneer aircraft are operated between Jesselton, Sandakan, Lahad Datu and Tawau; other regular scheduled and charter services are provided by Twin Pioneer aircraft linking Labuan, Jesselton, Kudat, Ranau, Keningau and Telupid.

In 1961 there were 13,867 aircraft movements at North Borneo aerodromes.

In 1961 728,092 passengers were carried on the railways and the weight of freight hauled was 47,609 tons. The total length of the railway, which is of metre gauge and serves the West Coast from Jesselton southwards and part of the interior, is 116 miles.

There are 238 miles of roads with bitumen-sealed surface, 112 miles of other metalled roads, and 578 miles of earth/gravel roads. Work is now in progress, however, on a network of roads eventually designed to connect up the main centres of population and it is anticipated that the East and West Coasts will be linked by road communications within a few years.

The chief ports of the Colony are Sankanda, Jesselton, Tawau, Labuan, Lahad Datu, Kudat and Semporna together with eight other timber-loading points and minor ports. Some forty shipping lines run services between ports in the Colony and the Far East, Australia, Europe, South Africa and U.S.A. The coastal shipping includes some 240 vessels which handle the inter-port trade and trade with the adjacent territories of Brunei and Sarawak. In 1961, 10,066,493 gross tons of shipping used the ports of the Colony and the quantity of cargo handled was 2,095,626 tons.

Broadcasting

The North Borneo Broadcasting Service (Radio Sabah) was inaugurated in November 1955 and a daily 9½ hour programme is transmitted in Chinese (Kuo-yu and Hakka), Malay, Kadazan and English. The 5 kW. HF transmitter giving Colony-wide coverage and a 250 W. MF transmitter serving the Jesselton area are located at Kepayan, five miles from Jesselton. There are approximately 20,000 wireless licence holders in the Colony.

Principal Occupations

The estimated numbers of persons engaged in 1961 in the principal fields of economic activity were as follows:

- Agriculture:
  - Rice Production: 78,000
  - Rubber Production: 26,000
  - Coconut, Copra and Coconut-oil Production: 8,000
  - Other Agricultural Occupations: 14,000
  - Fishing: 6,500
  - Commerce: 8,000
  - Government Services: 3,500
  - Timber Production: 10,000
  - Transport and Communications: 5,000
  - Building: 4,500
  - Manufacturing: 7,000

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are rubber, coconuts, rice and hemp; the acreage under the first two crops continues to expand rapidly but the cigar wrapper leaf estate has recently closed. Extensive areas for the cultivation of rubber, cocoa and oil palms are being opened, in some cases by Land Development Co-operatives.

An Agricultural Census was conducted in 1961; this gave the following figures for livestock population: ponies 4,500, cattle 14,500, buffaloes 66,800, pigs 81,100, goats 17,600 and poultry 1,000,000.

The total output of timber in 1961 expressed in cubic feet quarter-girth round measurement was 72,628,159 cubic feet.

Interest in fish pond production continues, 700 ponds having been constructed and stocked. The total area is 60 acres and the estimated yield of fish 20 tons. More farmers are adopting the "Monosex" method of Tilapia culture.

A geological survey is being undertaken to determine the mineral wealth of the country, mining companies are prospecting for chromite,
iron ore and copper, and a large oil company is prospecting for oil.

Trade

| Year | Imports $ million | Exports $ million |
|------|------------------|------------------|
| 1957 | 121.6            | 120.9            |
| 1958 | 128.5            | 130.4            |

| 1961 | 215.0            | 220.3            |

Original sources of imports are difficult to state on account of the territory's dependence on supplies from the entrepôt markets of Singapore and Hong Kong. Similarly it is not possible to determine accurately the ultimate destination of all the Colony's exports.

During 1961 imports by countries of origin and exports by countries of destination were:

**Imports.**—U.K. accounted for 21·5%, other Commonwealth countries 24·25%, Foreign countries 54·25%.

**Exports.**—U.K. received 7·6%, other Commonwealth countries 19·0%, Foreign countries 73·4%.
