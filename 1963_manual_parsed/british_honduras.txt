BRITISH HONDURAS

Note.—In common with the entries for most of the other territories, the latest annual figures given below usually relate to 1961. Extensive damage was caused in British Honduras by Hurricane "Hattie" which struck on the 31st October 1961. In comparing the 1961 figures with those of previous years, therefore, the dislocation caused by the hurricane in the last two months of that year should be borne in mind. Also, because 1962 was the first year of a planned four-year reconstruction period, it is not yet apparent how far statistical patterns for the years up to 1961 inclusive should serve to indicate the likely figures for 1962 and afterwards.

Area

British Honduras lies on the Caribbean coast of Central America, bounded on the north and part of the west by Mexico and by Guatemala in the remainder of the west and south. Its land area is about 8,866 square miles, which includes a number of islets, known as "cayes", lying off the coast.

Population

At the census taken in April 1960 the total population was 90,019. The main racial groups are: Creoles, American Indians (Maya) and Caribs. There are also a number of persons of East Indian and Spanish descent. The races are, however, now heavily inter-mixed and a great many persons would have considerable difficulty in deciding to which group they belong.

English is the official language and the language taught in the schools. Spanish is also in common use, chiefly by the Indians, whose language it is tending to replace. The term Creole is now commonly used to denote local negroes and persons of negro extraction; it is also used in respect of persons of mixed Spanish and Indian descent.

Principal Towns

| Population |
|------------|
| Belize City (capital) | 32,690 |
| Corozal | 3,164 |
| Orange Walk | 2,141 |
| El Cayo | 1,819 |
| Stann Creek | 5,276 |
| Punta Gorda | 1,753 |

Geographical Features

The coastline is, for the most part, flat and swampy, but the country rises gradually towards the interior. The Maya Mountains and the Cockscombs, which reach a height of 3,700 feet, form the backbone of the southern half of the Colony. All of the western (Cayo) District is hilly and includes the Mountain Pine Ridge most of which lies between 1,000 and 2,000 feet above sea level but rises in parts to around 3,000 feet. The northern districts are also hilly except towards the coast but contain considerable areas of low tableland. There are seventeen principal rivers, of which the Belize River is the most important. None is navigable by vessels over five feet draught and few for any notable distance. An estimated 92% of the mainland is under forest.

Climate

The climate is sub-tropical and on the whole agreeable to non-tropical peoples. In the capital, Belize City, the temperature range during the year is 50° to 96° with an average mean of 78·5°. Most of the year the heat and humidity are tempered by sea breezes. This description applies with small variation along the whole coastal area. Inland the day temperatures, during the dry season, tend to be higher, up to 100°, but drop considerably at night. Rainfall increases from north to south:

| Annual average Inches |
|------------------------|
| Corozal (north) | 51 |
| Belize City (central) | 63 |
| El Cayo (western central) | 52 |
| Stann Creek (upper south) | 147 |
| Toledo (south) | 175 |
There are two dry seasons, the main one from March to May and the other in August and September (called the Maugre Season).

The Colony has been struck from time to time by hurricanes.

In recent years:

- a hurricane struck Belize City on the 10th September 1931 causing heavy loss of life and property;
- on the 27th September 1955 Hurricane "Janet" struck the northern part of the country completely destroying the town of Corozal and damaging dozens of villages in the Orange Walk District. Damage was estimated at over $4 million. The United Kingdom Government gave assistance totalling $3,480,000—$800,000 of this being a loan and the rest a free grant;
- on the 15th July 1960 Hurricane "Abby" struck the area of the Sittee River, south of Stann Creek, causing some damage to crops and dwellings;
- on the 24th July 1961 Hurricane "Anna" wrought fairly extensive damage to crops and houses in the villages of Seine Bight and Placencia and Sittee River and almost completely destroyed banana plantations at Waha Leaf in the Stann Creek District;
- on the 31st October 1961 Hurricane "Hattie" caused 262 deaths and most serious damage to Belize City, Stann Creek and other parts of the country.

History

The present Settlement was apparently established in 1638 but British sea rovers were frequenting the Bay from long before that year and there is some evidence that a Settlement was formed in or around 1603. Logwood was the attraction, and the 1638 Settlement was augmented from time to time by sea rovers and—notably after the capture of Jamaica by British forces in 1655—by disbanded British soldiers and sailors. In the Treaty of Madrid, 1670, Spain recognized Britain's sovereignty over the Bay Settlement.

Concurrently another and larger British Settlement was building up on the Moskito Indian Coast, far to the south of British Honduras. Modern historians frequently confuse the two Settlements; but although they assisted each other on occasion, they were entirely separate organizations with quite different forms of government. The Moskito Indians stubbornly and successfully resisted Spanish intrusion but welcomed and became loyal allies of the British settlers. The Moskito Coast settlers were known as the Shoremen and the Bay settlers as the Baymen. In 1786 Britain handed over the Moskito Coast to Spain in return for a small and comparatively worthless strip of land contiguous to the Bay Settlement. Some of the Shoremen moved to Jamaica and the rest were compulsorily evacuated to the strip, where they became merged with the Baymen.

The Bay Settlement was a piece of purely British pioneering. The Spaniards found plentiful supplies of logwood, and Indians for slaves, in Northern Yucatan and settled there. Southern Yucatan, on the other hand, was by then practically devoid of Indians and its littoral was a wilderness of mosquito-infested mangrove swamps guarded by lee-shore reefs and tricky channels. The Spaniards therefore left this coast alone until the British began to settle around the mouth of the Belize River. The export of logwood from the Bay Settlement broke the highly profitable Spanish monopoly, brought great prosperity to Britain's wool and cloth-dyeing trades and caused Spain to launch attack after attack on the Settlement in an effort to drive out her competitors.

This armed aggression continued until 1798, when the Spaniards invaded the Settlement in strong naval and military force. The Baymen, although badly under-armed and heavily outnumbered, resisted and, after several days of skirmishing, the forces met in sea battle off St. George's Cay. Supported by H.M. Sloop Merlin, the Baymen fought with such determination that the Spaniards were forced to retreat. This was Spain's last attempt to dislodge the Baymen by force of arms.

Until 1786 the Baymen governed themselves. In that year, after many petitions from the Baymen, England appointed and sent out a Superintendent, but the office was allowed to lapse in 1791. In 1797 Colonel Thomas Barrow was appointed Superintendent and was also given the title of Commander-in-Chief (held by the Governors of the Colony ever since) to enable him to organize the defence against the obviously impending Spanish attack. Thereafter the office of Superintendent continued until 1862, when it was replaced by that of Lieutenant-Governor, under the Governor of Jamaica and the Settlement raised to the status of a Colony. The Baymen resented being subordinated to Jamaica and in 1884 the Colony was detached from Jamaica and given a Governor.

Constitution

In 1954 the Legislative Council was replaced by a Legislative Assembly composed of nine elected members, three ex officio members and a Speaker and three unofficial members nominated by the Governor. The status of the Executive Council was changed to that of chief instrument of policy and it was composed of the Governor, as Chairman, three ex officio members and six members of the Legislative Assembly. The latter were elected by the Assembly but included not less than two of the nominated unofficial members of that body. Universal adult suffrage was also introduced in 1954, and the first general election under the new Constitution was held on 28th April 1954. The only fully organized party, the People's United Party, gained eight of the nine elected seats. The principle of Steering Members, appointed by the Governor from among the unofficial members of the Executive Council, as the first step towards full ministerial status, was adopted in 1955.

At the general elections which took place on the 20th March 1957 the People's United Party gained all nine of the elected seats.

In February 1960 a Conference was convened in London by H.M. Government to consider inter alia proposals for the development of the Constitution of British Honduras. This conference was attended by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Minister of State with their Advisers; the Governor of British Honduras and official and unofficial members of the Government; and the leaders of the political parties in the territory.
The Conference decided to adopt a ministerial form of Government based on a revised Legislative Assembly and Executive Council. This revised Constitution was introduced in March 1961 following a general election. The new Legislative Assembly presided over by a Speaker, consists of 18 members elected by the general public, five nominated members and two ex-officio members (the Chief Secretary (formerly known as the Colonial Secretary) and the Attorney General). The normal life of the Assembly is four years. The revised Executive Council under the chairmanship of the Governor, consists of two ex-officio members (the Chief Secretary, responsible inter alia for defence, security and external affairs, and the Attorney General) and six unofficial members holding various departmental portfolios as Ministers, of whom at least one must be a nominated member of the Legislative Assembly. The leader of the political party obtaining a majority at a general election for the Legislative Assembly seats would be appointed First Minister and the remaining five unofficial members of the Executive Council are elected by the unofficial members of the Legislative Assembly from among their own number. As regards the five nominated members of the Legislative Assembly, these are filled by the Governor, after consultation with the First Minister in respect of two seats and after consultation with the leader of the minority party in respect of one seat, the remaining two seats being filled by the Governor after consultation with the leaders of both the majority and minority parties. Further details are set out in a White Paper issued by H.M. Government as Cmdn. 984.

At the general election held in March 1961, the People's United Party, led by Mr. George Price, won all the 18 elected seats in the Legislative Assembly. Mr. Price was thereupon appointed First Minister and his Ministry has since held office.

The former post of Financial Secretary has now been replaced by that of Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance, a Ministry which is in the portfolio of the First Minister. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance attends meetings of the Executive Council but is not a member either of the Council or of the Legislative Assembly.

**Land Policy**

The alienation of Crown land is carefully controlled to prevent, as far as possible, the acquisition of such land for purely speculative, non-productive purposes. No racial discrimination is exercised.

During 1953 and 1954 a land use survey was carried out. A land policy, based on the findings and recommendations of the Survey Team, has been formulated and was published by Government in 1958.

**Taxation**

Income tax is levied on a graduated scale rising from 5% on the first $500 of chargeable income to 45% on all income over $25,000. Surtax is levied on the first $2,000 in excess of $8,000 of chargeable income at the rate of 10%; on the next $5,000 at the rate of 15%; on the next $5,000 at the rate of 20%; and on the remainder at 25%. Deductions allowed against income are a personal allowance of $600, plus allowances for children, dependent relatives, life assurance premiums, earned income and gifts to charity. The rate of tax on companies is 40% of the chargeable income of the company.

**Public Finance** (see also section immediately below)

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1957 | $8,691,319 | $8,002,687 |
| 1958 | $9,187,829 | $9,267,786 |
| 1959 | $10,372,233 | $10,401,433 |
| 1960 | $8,947,958 | $9,795,852 |
| 1961 | $10,450,525 | $9,044,140 |

In 1961 $3,159,631 of the true revenue was derived from Customs duties and charges and $2,564,071 from internal taxation. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were: Administration $2,932,321, Public Works $2,054,961, Social Services $2,220,372.

The Public Debt of the Colony at the end of 1961 amounted to $4,591,310. Sinking funds on hand amounted to $972,964, leaving $3,618,346 as the net outstanding debt.

**Financial Assistance towards Reconstruction after Hurricane "Hattie" (1961)**

In May 1962 the Secretary of State announced that, subject to the approval of Parliament, Her Majesty's Government had decided to make available to the Government of British Honduras aid totalling approximately £5 million. Of this amount about £1 million had already been incurred on emergency assistance immediately following the hurricane. Of the balance of £4 million, which would be spread over four years, £2½ million would be towards the general programme of reconstruction, and £1¼ million towards the cost of building a new capital, subject to the approval of a satisfactory plan. If during the four-year period it appeared that further funds would be required for reconstruction, Her Majesty's Government would consider making an additional contribution of up to £750,000.

(Note.—Although severe damage was done to Belize City, on the low sea-coast, by Hurricane "Hattie", it was not by any means damaged beyond repair. The building of a new capital inland is being contemplated, however, because it may be preferable for the capital, in future, to be in an area less vulnerable to hurricane damage.)

**Currency**

The unit of currency is the British Honduras dollar which is exchanged at four to the £ sterling. Notes of $20, $10, $5, $2 and $1 are issued and there is a silver coinage of 50, 25 and 10 cents, a nickel coin of 25 cents (new issue) and one of 5 cents and a bronze 1 cent coin.

**Development Plans**

British Honduras received Colonial Development and Welfare allocations from the United Kingdom totalling £2,250,000 during the period 1945–56. Additional allocations totalling £1,950,000 were made for the period 1955–60 and a further allocation of £2,000,000 has been made under the 1959 Act for the period up to March 1964.
The bulk of the Colonial Development and Welfare funds is being spent on projects which will raise the general economy of the country and so result in a higher standard of living for all. A substantial part of the money is being spent on agriculture, forestry and communications. Considerable sums are also being spent on education, social welfare, medical services and housing.

Under the Development Loan Ordinance, 1952, and the Loans (General Development) Ordinance, 1957, loans totalling $2,257,441, had been raised by the end of 1961, $832,525 of this by the issue of Government debentures locally, and the balance by inter-Colonial Loan.

Other Development

Two firms, Hercules B.H. Ltd. and Pine Harvesters Ltd. have begun an investment programme of some $5 million in regard to a project to produce resin from pine stumps. The plant which is situated at Big Creek in the Stann Creek District is nearing completion and will shortly commence operations.

Salada Foods Inc. has acquired the Colonial Development Corporation holdings in the Stann Creek Valley and proposes to plant out extensive acreages of citrus over the next ten years. It also hopes to establish a plant for the production of frozen concentrates at a later stage. The citrus orchards, and the cocoa plantations in the upper region of the Stann Creek Valley were severely affected by Hurricane "Hattie" but are showing promising signs of recovery.

An annual export quota of 10,000 tons of sugar to the United States has been granted to this country. Consideration is being given to when and how this quota will be fulfilled. This is in addition to the 25,000 ton quota under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement.

An Economic Survey Mission sponsored by the United Nations Technical Assistance Board has completed over two months of inquiry and research in British Honduras; its report which is expected soon may result in a new long-term plan for the future development of the country.

Following an inquiry into the future economic development of British Honduras in October 1959 by Mr. Jack Downie, a Senior Economic Adviser of H.M. Treasury, it was agreed that the central feature of economic policy should be planned immigration aimed at the creation, as quickly as financial, sociological and other considerations allow, of an agricultural economy based on large scale enterprises (i.e. plantations) and individual small holdings. Because of the high cost of settling immigrants, and the shortage of funds to do so, it has not yet been possible to implement this policy.

Education

Primary education is compulsory and is principally through subsidized denominational schools controlled by a Board of Education. There were at the end of 1961, two government and 126 grant-aided primary schools with an enrolment of 21,268. In addition there are 31 unaided primary schools with an enrolment of 1,500. There are 13 secondary schools, all unaided and denominational with 1,864 pupils, one government-run Technical College with 60 pupils and two Teacher Training Colleges. There is no provision for education of university standard but scholarships are awarded which carry the recipients to the University of the West Indies (Jamaica) and to universities in the U.K. The University stations an Extra Mural Tutor in Belize City.

Expenditure on education from general revenue during 1961 was $963,868, compared with $71,175 in 1935.

Libraries, etc.

The British Honduras Library Service conducts the public library services of the country. It has a Central Library in modern quarters in Belize City (which includes a National Collection) and two other branches as well as a Children's Library there; and 50 other service-points scattered throughout the country. The majority of the service-points have reading and reference sections. Before the hurricane of October 1961, the Service had a total of 39,000 volumes. Some 19,000 were lost in the hurricane, but most of these have been replaced through purchases and presentations from various countries. The Service has approximately 10,000 registered members.

The Central Library is accommodated in the Bliss Institute, which is also the locality of the Extra Mural Department of the University of the West Indies, as well as that of a modern stage and auditorium. Evening classes are conducted regularly as well as dramatic productions.

The British Council has an office and a Representative in Belize City.

Health

The Colony is relatively free from endemic disease. Malaria, which was most prevalent, has shown a substantial decrease in incidence owing to the half-yearly spraying with D.D.T. undertaken by Government. The main general hospital is in Belize City and there are small hospitals in each of the five districts, all run by Government. There is also a 25 bed private hospital in the capital. Beds total 345. Some 16 Government and Mission rural dispensaries in the more important villages are each in charge of a qualified rural health nurse.

A tuberculosis hospital, a venereal disease unit, an infirmary and a mental hospital are also maintained by Government in Belize City.

Expenditure on health services from general revenue during 1961 was $835,382 compared with $80,071 in 1935.

Communications

Stanley Field, about ten miles north-west of Belize City, is the principal airport of the Colony. International air services are operated to the Colony by the following airlines:

British West Indian Airways (B.W.I.A.).
Transportes Aereos Centro Americanos, S.A. (T.A.C.A. International).
Servicio Aereo de Honduras, S.A. (S.A.H.S.A.).
Transportes Aereos Nacionales, S.A.(T.A.N.).

There is a weekly service between Jamaica and Belize City and twice-weekly services New Orleans (U.S.A.), Belize City and San Salvador via Guatemala City and return; Miami, Belize City and San Pedro Sula (Honduras) and return; San Pedro Sula, Puerto Barrios (Guatemala) and Belize City and return. Maya Airways also operate an
internal air service on schedule to district towns and to other parts of the Colony.

There are 500 miles of all-weather main and feeder roads and 174½ miles of cart roads and bush trails maintained by Government. Forty-three miles of new feeder roads have been built to serve the sugar cane industry in the Corozal district. An unknown, but considerable, mileage of dirt roads built by logging contractors and the Forest Department, public use of which is permitted, will take, for example, jeeps and landrovers, in the dry season. A new road linking Punta Gorda and Stann Creek is now under construction and this should be completed in 1963.

The United Fruit Company maintains a weekly passenger and cargo service between Belize City and New Orleans. The T. and J. Harrison and the Royal Netherlands S.S. lines offer a regular fortnightly cargo service between Belize City and the United Kingdom and Europe respectively, the Royal Netherlands ships offering limited passenger accommodation. The Caribbean line operates an irregular service between New York and Belize City.

In 1961 a total of 35 steam and motor vessels and 28 sailing vessels, 1,200 gross tons in all, registered at the port of Belize City. The tonnage figures of shipping which entered the country in 1961 are not available as a result of loss of records during Hurricane "Hattie".

Telecommunications

Cable & Wireless Ltd. have been granted a licence to operate the external telecommunications service of the country which also includes radiotelephone facilities with major towns and cities in the U.S.A., the Caribbean and the United Kingdom.

The Belize City telephone system will shortly be taken over also by Cable & Wireless Ltd. and the company will install a new improved system.

There is also an internal telecommunications system in operation.

Information Service

On 1st November 1962, Information and Broadcasting were separated and two new Departments formed. The Government Information Service is now in charge of all Government publicity material, press liaison, campaigns and exhibitions to project the activities and policies of the Government to the people at home and abroad.

Broadcasting

Government operates a radio broadcasting service (Radio Belize) transmitting from Belize City on the following frequencies and powers: 830 kc/s. (361 metres), 5 kW. and 3-3 Mc/s. (90 metres), 5 kW. Programmes are given in English and Spanish and include both local and foreign news, announcements of local interest, local features, transcribed music and plays. Daily time totals about ten hours and will be increased when new stations planned for 1963 are completed. Receiving sets in the Colony totalled about 2,000 in 1961.

Principal Occupations

Most of the working population are engaged in agriculture on their own account.

The estimated numbers engaged in the principal wage earning occupations at the end of 1961 were:

| Occupation                        | Numbers |
|-----------------------------------|---------|
| Agriculture                       | 1,952   |
| Manufacture and Repair            | 2,082   |
| Forestry                          | 1,594   |
| Personal services (hotel staff, electricians, etc.) | 300     |
| Commerce                          | 585     |
| Public Service and Government     | 3,584   |
| Building and Construction         | 492     |
| Mining (Oil Exploration)          | 120     |
| Printing                          | 120     |
| Transport, Storage and Communications | 1,865 |

Membership of trade unions totalled 2,803 (declared nominal membership) at the end of 1961. There are six trade unions in the Colony.

Main Crops and Products

Indian corn (maize), beans and peas, rice, sugar, cassava and yams are the principal food crops of the Colony. The main export crops are coconuts, citrus fruits and products, sugar, bananas and maize. Cattle, pigs and poultry are raised throughout the Colony. Timber is the principal export product, mainly mahogany, pine and cedar. Rosewood, banak, Santa Maria and other woods are also exported. Efforts are being directed to building up the Colony's fisheries, and an export trade to the United States, chiefly in lobsters, is growing.

Of industries sawmilling is the most important and a cigarette factory, a soap factory, an aluminium door, window and louvre fabricating factory, a garment factory and several small furniture factories, are operating in Belize City. In different parts of the Colony there are canneries, one operating in the Stann Creek Valley on citrus products is of notable size and in the Corozal District there is a large sugar factory.

Trade

| Year | Imports       | Re-exports | Domestic Exports |
|------|---------------|------------|------------------|
| 1957 | $15,108,063   | $1,591,139 | $7,352,262        |
| 1958 | $18,516,241   | $1,319,813 | $7,768,062        |
| 1959 | $19,561,208   | $708,569   | $8,854,469        |
| 1960 | $18,783,607   | $1,062,512 | $10,164,943       |
| 1961 | $22,517,922   | $1,215,769 | $11,186,533       |

In 1938 19·1% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 12·9% from other Commonwealth countries and 68·0% from foreign countries. The corresponding figures for 1961 were: 28·90%, 12·23% and 58·87%.

In 1938 22·5% of exports went to the United Kingdom, 6·3% to other Commonwealth countries and 71·2% to foreign countries. The corresponding figures for 1961 were: 67·92%, 15·20% and 16·88%.

The chief imports are normally vehicles, motor spirits, machinery, cotton and artificial silk piecegoods, beans and peas, condensed, evaporated and powdered milk, flour, butter, margarine and lard substitutes. There are, of course, also likely to be special imports in the four-year reconstruction period (1962-66).

### Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

A Marketing Board is operated by Government; its principal concern is with the purchase of agricultural produce such as rice, beans and corn at guaranteed prices and the marketing of these products both locally and abroad. It also makes seasonal crop loans.

At the end of 1961 there were 42 Credit Unions, one Consumer Co-operative, five Producers’ Co-operatives, six Marketing Co-operatives, three Farmers’ Co-operatives, nine Housing Co-operatives and one Multi-purpose Co-operative. In addition there were 27 junior and two senior Savings Unions and a secondary society, The British Honduras Credit Union League, Ltd.
