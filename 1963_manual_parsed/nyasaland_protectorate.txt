NYASALAND PROTECTORATE

(See also section on The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and page 6)

Area

The area is 45,747 square miles of which 9,266 square miles is water. Of this, Lake Nyasa itself covers an area of 8,870 square miles.

Population

The estimated population at the 31st December 1961 was 2,921,100 divided approximately as follows:

- Europeans: 8,800
- Africans: 2,900,000
- Other Races: 12,300

The main tribal groups of the Africans are:

| Tribe          | Per cent. (approx.) |

Geographical Features

Nyasaland may be divided into the following four main zones:

(a) The dominant feature of the deep trough-like depression which is part of the Great Rift Valley of Eastern Africa and the greater part of which is occupied by Lake Nyasa. The water level is about 1,550 feet above sea level. The deepest part of the Lake is near its northern end and is about 2,300 feet.

(b) The high tableland, separating Lake Nyasa from the basin of the Luangwa River, ranging from an altitude of 4,500 feet in the Central Plateau to 8,000 feet in the Nyika Plateau in the north.

(c) The Southern or Shire Highlands Plateau, bounded on the west by the Shire River and on the south-east by the Ruo River, having a general elevation of 2,000–3,500 feet and rising to the mountain masses of Mlanje (10,000 feet) and Zomba (7,000 feet).

(d) The lowlands of the Lower River Shire Basin in the extreme south. This area contains much marshland and is liable to extensive flooding.

Three smaller and shallow lakes, Lakes Malombe, Chiwya and Chiuta lie to the south of Lake Nyasa.

Climate

The rainfall divides the year into two seasons, the dry season from May to October and the wet season from November to April. Rainfall figures have been very variable in past years.

History

The modern history of Nyasaland may be said to have begun with the discovery by David Livingstone of Lake Nyasa in 1859. British
interest in the area was sustained by various missionary societies including the Universities Mission to Central Africa (Anglican), the Church of Scotland and Free Church of Scotland Missions. The country during these early years was occupied by migrant tribes warring with one another and selling their prisoners to Arab and half-caste slave dealers. The missionary pioneers were followed by other Europeans—missionaries, traders, hunters and planters—and in 1883 a British Consul resident at Blantyre was accredited to "The Kings and Chiefs of Central Africa"; the second Consul established himself at Zomba, now the seat of Government. Access to Nyasaland from the coast was difficult during the latter part of the nineteenth century. In 1889 a Portuguese expedition under Major Serpa Pinto came into conflict with one of the Makololo Chiefs, in consequence of which the Acting Consul, a pioneer planter named Buchanan, proclaimed a British Protectorate over the Shire country on the 21st September 1889. In 1891 an Anglo-Portuguese Convention ratified the work of Mr. H. H. (later Sir Harry) Johnston, Mr. (later Sir) Alfred Sharpe and others, and a Protectorate was proclaimed over the countries adjoining Lake Nyasa. In 1893 the name of the Territory was changed to "The British Central Africa Protectorate" but in 1907 a further Order in Council revived the old name of "The Nyasaland Protectorate". The Northern Angoni in what is now the Northern Province did not come fully within the sphere of British administration until 1904.

There were internal disturbances in 1915, known as the Chilembwe Rising, when an African pastor, at the instigation of the German authorities, rose with his followers in the Blantyre neighbourhood and murdered several Europeans against whom the rebels had personal grudges; and in 1953 disturbances in the Southern Province, attributed in large part to discontent over the African tenant system obtaining in privately-held estate land, resulted in the deaths of 12 Africans. In both cases rapid and successful countermeasures were taken.

In March 1959 following a number of disturbances throughout the country, a state of emergency was declared, and serious riots subsequently took place, particularly in the Northern Province. Reinforcements of troops and police were brought in from neighbouring territories and order was quickly restored.

The state of emergency was lifted in June 1960.

**Constitution**

The Protectorate is one of three territories which compose the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (see page 165), although Her Majesty's Government have accepted, in principle, the territory's right to secede. A new Constitution for the territory which is based on the agreed recommendation of a Constitutional Conference which took place in November 1962, and which was attended by both major political parties in the territory, is being introduced in two stages.

The first stage took effect on the 1st February 1963 and the then existing Constitution was amended to bring into force changes in the composition of the Executive Council, restyled "Cabinet", and the Legislature, including the appointment of a Prime Minister (Dr. Banda). The second stage which is expected to be brought into operation in the late Spring of 1963 has the following main provisions:

The Governor will be required to consult the Cabinet in the exercise of his functions and would normally act in accordance with the advice he receives. He retains reserved powers in the fields of the economy and finance, the public service, public safety and operational control of the police. He is assisted by a Deputy Governor.

**The Cabinet**

The Cabinet which is collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly, replaces the former Executive Council and is composed of a Prime Minister, normally not more than eight other Ministers and the Financial Secretary, who is *ex officio* Minister of Finance. Provision exists under the Constitution that the number of Ministers can be increased if the Prime Minister considers it necessary and Her Majesty's Government concur and under which, at a time to be agreed between the Nyasaland Government and Her Majesty's Government, the Portfolio of Finance can be assumed by an elected member.

The Governor, on the advice of the Prime Minister, has power to appoint Parliamentary Secretaries to assist Ministers.

The Legislative Assembly replaces the former Legislative Council and consists of a Speaker, the Financial Secretary, so long as he is a member of the Cabinet, and for the present 28 elected members. Any Minister who is not a member of the Legislative Assembly has the right to attend and take part in the proceedings of the Assembly, but not to vote. The Assembly has a life of not more than five years.

The 28 elected members are elected in single member geographical constituencies on a two-tier qualitative franchise containing members of all races. Twenty of these are elected in one set of constituencies by voters who satisfy the lower qualifications and eight in another set of constituencies by voters who satisfy the higher qualifications. At the 1962 Conference it was agreed that future changes to the franchise could be carried out at a later convenient date after further consultations. The last general election was held in August 1961.

The new Constitution also incorporates changes in the Judiciary which were agreed at the 1962 Conference. The appointment of the Chief Justice will be made by the Governor after consultation with the Prime Minister. Other judges of the High Court will be appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Judicial Service Commission. Judges' salaries which are at present fixed by the Governor will be prescribed by law.

The Constitution provides for the establishment of Public, Police and Judicial service Commissions with executive powers. Until a full compensation scheme is brought into operation, the Commissions will be advisory to the Governor in respect of overseas civil servants.

The new Constitution also embodies a Bill of Rights.

**Land Policy**

Land policy is controlled so far as African Trust Land, which comprises 87% of the total area of the Protectorate, is concerned, by the Nyasaland
Protectorate (African Trust Land) Orders in Council, 1950 to 1962. Under these Orders in Council Africans may use and occupy African Trust Land not held under lease in accordance with the African law and custom prevailing in the area. The Orders in Council empower the Governor at his discretion to lease trust land for terms up to 99 years, while the Secretary of State's sanction is required for the grant of any greater estate. The remainder of the land is either held in private ownership or is public land, which includes areas of state forest; the disposal of public land is controlled by the Public Land Ordinance 1951, which empowers the Governor to make grants, leases or other dispositions subject to the provisions of any Order in Council or any general or special instruction of the Secretary of State.

Taxation

A Poll Tax is payable by non-African males over 18 years of age, resident in the Protectorate, at the rate of £8 per annum. An African Tax is payable by all male Africans over 18 years of age. The rate with effect from the 1st January 1958 is 30s. per annum. Both the African and non-African Poll Tax can be set off against any Territorial surcharge paid by the individual concerned.

Income Tax and Customs and Excise duties are assessed and collected by the Federal Government, which took over direct responsibility for them on the 1st April 1954.

Rates of Income Tax (1960–61) rise from 9d. in the £ on the first £500 of chargeable income to 5s. 5d. in the £ in excess of £2,500 for married persons. No income tax is payable on incomes of less than £800 in the case of married persons or £400 in the case of single persons. There are primary rebates of £37 10s. and £25 respectively for married and single persons and rebates for children, dependants, blind persons and food farmers and in respect of insurance premiums and benefit fund contributions. Private Companies pay tax at 5s. 5d. in the £ on the first £25,000 of taxable income or profits and 6s. 8d. in the £ in excess of £25,000. Companies other than Private Companies pay tax at 6s. 8d. in the £.

Supertax is levied (after an allowance of £4,000 for married persons and £2,000 for single persons) on taxable income plus dividends received by residents of the Federation from all sources. Non-residents of the Federation are not liable to supertax on dividends received from companies incorporated in the Federation unless they carry on business there. Certain external companies as defined in the income tax law are also subject to supertax.

The rates of supertax for married persons are 2s. 4d. in the £ for the first £1,000 of supertax income (i.e., the fifth £1,000 of taxable income) rising to 4s. 1d. in the £ over £6,000. For single persons the supertax rate is 1s. 7d. for the first £1,000 of supertax income (i.e. the third £1,000 of taxable income) to 4s. 1d. over £6,000.

A tax is levied on the undistributed profits of private companies as defined in the income tax law, at the rate of 2s. 9d. in the £ on the first £2,000 of the undistributed profits and at the rate of 5s. in the £ on the remainder.

On all tax payable a surcharge is raised by the Territorial Government amounting to 20 per cent. of the Federal tax payable by both persons and companies.

Currency

The Bank of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was established in 1956 and issues the Federal currency. Southern Rhodesia currency continues also as legal tender for the present. United Kingdom coins ceased to be legal tender as from 1st January 1955.

Development Plan

The new capital development plan covering the period 1962-65 was published in July 1962. It provides for an expenditure under Part I of £12·8 million over the three-year period with the main emphasis on economic development, especially in the agricultural field, and on the expansion of educational facilities. The major agricultural projects include a scheme for agricultural credit and farm development for which £400,000 has been allocated, a scheme for the acquisition of land for the settlement of African farmers at a cost of £450,000 and provision for construction of two provincial farm institutes (£84,000) and district and rural training centres (£100,000). A rapid expansion of the co-operative marketing of crops is proposed, and by integrating agricultural credit with co-operative marketing it is hoped to achieve a notable advance in the production of cash crops. The scheme for the acquisition of land for settlement will be applied mainly in the Southern Province and will be directed towards the relief of population pressure in existing areas of African settlement and the provision of land suitable for the development of tea growing by Africans. The two farm institutes will provide agricultural courses for progressive African farmers and will be supplemented by the district and rural training centres where agricultural advisory and teaching services will be made available to the local farming communities.

The principal project in the education programme is the development of secondary education for which a sum of £900,000 has been provided. The aim is to increase secondary school streams to the maximum number consistent with the resources available on both capital and recurrent account. Two other major educational projects are the provision of facilities for higher education at university level for which £300,000 has been allocated for expenditure during the plan period, and the construction of a polytechnic at Blantyre at a cost of £445,000 to provide for the further education of adults in general and technical subjects, including specialist and commercial training.

Provision of £250,000 has also been made in the new plan for the development of secondary industries under the aegis of a Development Finance Company. It is expected that this body will provide loans for suitable industrial ventures and act as an agency for the investigation of industrial potentials in any promising field.

Part II of the plan contains projects which are basically of a commercial nature in which private enterprise is expected to participate, either in partnership with the Government or on its own, and envisages an expenditure of £6·3 million over the plan period. It includes the Elephant Marsh Scheme, which would be a major reclamation project; extensions of the schemes for agricultural credit and the development of secondary industries, provided for in Part I of the plan; the development of hotels and tourism; and high density housing.

The following is a summary of the allocation of funds provided in the Estimates on Development Account for 1962-63:

| Per cent. |
|-----------|
| Administrative & Judicial Buildings | 4 |
| Housing | 7 |
| Public Works | 24 |
| Education and Social Welfare | 12 |
| Police | 5 |
| Natural Resources | 33 |
| Loans to Local Authorities and Direct Investment in Development of Urban areas | 13 |
| Rural Development | 2 |
| Commerce and Industry | 2 |
| Miscellaneous | 8 |

Education

During 1961 non-African education and all higher education remained the responsibility of the Federal Government.

In 1961 there were 23 Government streams enrolling 2,182 pupils and students. These were 8 junior primary schools with 1,333 pupils; 1 senior primary school with 115 pupils; 3 secondary schools with 331 pupils; 4 teacher training colleges with 134 students; 7 technical or vocational establishments with a total enrolment of 269.

In 1961 agencies other than the Government conducted 3,170 school, training college and technical/vocational streams catering for 288,064 pupils or students. Of these 1,162 streams catering for 158,336 pupils received grant-in-aid and were staffed by qualified teachers. The remainder, mostly conducted by mission agencies, received no assistance from public funds.

In 858 aided junior primary streams 131,821 pupils were enrolled and in 1,963 unaided junior primary streams there were 127,734 pupils. Senior primary enrolment in 262 aided streams was 24,407 and in 28 unaided streams 1,429.

Seventeen aided secondary streams catered for 1,144 pupils and 5 unaided secondary streams for 265 pupils. In aided teacher training colleges 19 streams had 818 students enrolled and in the one unaided teacher training college there were 44 students. Technical and vocational establishments receiving aid had 146 students in 6 streams and similar establishments which were unaided had 256 students in 11 streams.

Expenditure on education during 1961 amounted to £1,607,045.

Libraries

Public libraries exist at Blantyre, to which Government gives financial support. Libraries are also maintained at the three secondary schools and at various mission stations while the British Council maintains a collection of books on a variety of subjects and makes these available to
study-groups and at welfare centres in the Southern Province. The Nyasaland Society maintains a library of books on Africana available for the use of members.

Health

Public Health became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July 1954.

The principal diseases encountered in Nyasaland are malaria, bilharzia, hookworm and relapsing fever. Leprosy is fairly widespread. Epidemics of smallpox rarely now occur, but there has recently been a severe outbreak in the Centre Province. Sleeping sickness, absent from the Protectorate for a number of years, re-appeared in a small way in the Southern Province in 1952 but again subsided.

There is 1 Central Hospital, 1 General Hospital, 14 District Hospitals, 14 Rural Hospitals and 2 Special Hospitals—1 Mental and 1 Leprosy—with accommodation for 282 and 458 persons respectively.

Each Hospital has a number of satellite health centres of which there are 94.

There are beds for Europeans and Asians in the Central Hospital, the General Hospital and one of the District Hospitals.

Mission Hospitals provide 1,616 beds, inclusive of maternity beds.

The total admissions and out-patient attendances at Federal Government Hospitals for Europeans, Asians and Coloureds and Africans at the end of December 1961 were:

| In-patients | Out-patients |
|-------------|--------------|
| Europeans   | 1,401        |
| Asians and Coloureds | 810         |
| Africans    | 57,903       |

Expenditure on health services during the financial year ending June 1962 was £1,045,056.

Communications

During 1954 the Federal Government assumed responsibility for civil aviation, inter-territorial roads and other aspects of communications.

The main airfield is at Blantyre. There is a secondary airfield at Lilongwe and 12 out-station airfields at eight of which Central African Airways Corporation operate internal scheduled services. The meteorological services are controlled by the Federal Director of Meteorological Services and a personal briefing service is available at Blantyre, Lilongwe and Mzimba. Air services to, from and within Nyasaland are under the direction of the Central African Air Transport Authority which body is also responsible for the control of air services within Northern and Southern Rhodesia. External services to South Africa are provided by Central African Airways Corporation and to East Africa and the United Kingdom by B.O.A.C. from Nairobi. Central African Airways and East African Airways each operate a weekly feeder service between Blantyre and Nairobi via Dar es Salaam.

The total length of line within Nyasaland operated by the Nyasaland Railways is 273 miles. There is only one route, from the southern extremity of Nyasaland via Limbe to Salima in the Central Province. At Chipoka, south of Salima, trains connect with the vessels operating on Lake Nyasa. In 1961 973,097 short tons of freight and 548,722 passengers were carried.

The total road mileage is 6,184, of which just over 266 miles have a bituminous carpet.

A lake service is operated by the Nyasaland Railways employing eight vessels. Routes operate between the following lake shore stations:

Monkey Bay—Chipoka—Kota Kota—Likoma Island—Chinteché—Nkata Bay—Mbamba Bay (Tanganyika)—Ruarwe—Florence Bay—Deep Bay—Manda (Tanganyika)—Ngara—Kaporó (for Karonga) and Mwaya (Tanganyika).

Broadcasting

The Federal Broadcasting Corporation established a regional station in Nyasaland in March 1960, using a 400 watt transmitter operated in the 90 metre band. This was replaced later that year by a 2½ kilowatt transmitter in the 76 metre band. Today the transmitter is 10 kilowatt and is being received satisfactorily within the Protectorate. The most recent development is the introduction in 1962 of a 250 watt medium wave transmitter in the 244 metre band. This transmitter is located at Blantyre and serves the Blantyre/Limbe area.

Short wave programmes originating at the Blantyre studio are sent to the transmitter at Mikuyu, near Zomba, by means of a post office circuit comprising a landline link from Blantyre to Limbe and a V.H.F. link to Mikuyu. Broadcasting hours have been doubled to six hours daily since August 1962. Programmes are in English Nyanja and Tumbuka (for the Northern Province).

Vernacular programmes include daily news bulletins, features, magazine programmes, plays, religious programmes, book reviews, request programmes, variety shows, tribal and town music, and programmes for particular communities such as farmers. Detailed listener research is not possible at the moment, but judging from the thousands of letters received each month, the programmes are popular with their local audiences.

Programmes are also received in the Protectorate from the Federal Broadcasting Corporation's stations in Lusaka and Salisbury. The Lusaka programme includes 15 hours of Nyanja per week and an early morning request programme in English, both of which attract African listeners in Nyasaland.

The General Service programmes from Salisbury serve the English-speaking community, who are also able to receive the B.B.C. Overseas Service, and South African and Portuguese East African stations.

Indian stations are received at good strength, so that the local Asian community are well served in their own languages. Reception of most of these stations is reasonable outside the ionospheric season.

It is estimated that there are some 30,000 inexpensive transistorised dry-battery sets in the Protectorate, an indication of the popularity of broadcasting, which continued to make encouraging progress during 1962.
Principal Occupations

The principal occupations are in the following trades or professions:

Europeans. Government service, religious missions, tobacco, tea, farming, wholesale and retail trading, engineering contract work.

Asians. Wholesale and retail trading.

Africans. The bulk of the population is engaged in agriculture; the remainder are employed in Government service, transport services, tobacco and tea industries, retail trading, and building construction.

On 31st December 1961 there were 15 employees' trade unions and six associations of employers.

Main Crops and Products

The main export crops are tea, tobacco, tung-oil, groundnuts, rice and cotton. Other major crops grown mainly for local consumption are maize, millet, cassava and miscellaneous pulses.

Exotic timber and pole plantations were extended in 1961 to give a total area of 29,024 acres. The most successful trees planted are various species of Pine, Eucalypt and Gmelina arborea. Timber production for 1961 amounted to 2,069,086 cubic feet.

There is extensive fishing in Lake Nyasa and commercial enterprises are in process of development; fishery research is being undertaken.

No minerals were exported on a commercial scale during 1961 although samples of various minerals were sent out of the country for analysis.

The export of manufactured articles is very restricted but local needs of soap, cigarettes and mineral waters, are largely met from factories in the Protectorate.

Trade

During 1954 the Federal Government assumed control of exports and imports.

| Year | Imports* | Re-exports | Domestic Exports |

* Including Government imports, but not bullion and specie.

No records are available of inter-territorial trade within the Federation and the above statistics of imports and exports refer to trade with countries outside the Federation.

The chief imports are metals, metal manufactures, machinery and vehicles; fibres, yarns, textiles and apparel; foodstuffs; oils, resins, waxes, paint and varnishes.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The marketing of the principal cash crops grown on African trust land, namely, tobacco, cotton, maize and groundnuts, is handled by a statutory board whose aim is to ensure a steady price to the producer, as near as possible to world prices, and to secure improvement of the quality of the product. The board helps to finance schemes for the benefit of Africans by means of contributions from surpluses to the African Development and Welfare Fund. Tea and tung, which are mainly European-grown crops, are marketed by the industries themselves, while tobacco, whether grown on African trust land or alienated land, is sold on auction floors, at which buyers representing United Kingdom and other extraterritorial interests bid.

On the 31st December 1961 there were 85 primary and 8 secondary co-operative societies, with 17,647 members and 67 member societies respectively. The main products handled are rice, coffee and ghee.
