NORTHERN RHODESIA
(See also section on The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and page 6).

Area
The Protectorate of Northern Rhodesia lies on the plateau of Central Africa. Its area is 288,130 square miles, including more than 3,000 square miles of inland water.

Population
The estimated population at 31st December 1961, revised in the light of the census held in September 1961, was as follows:

| African | European | Other Races |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| 2,430,000 | 75,000 | 9,800 |

Total: 2,514,800

Geographical Features
With the exception of the valleys of the Zambezi, the Luapula, the Kafue and the Luangwa Rivers the greater part of Northern Rhodesia has a flat to rolling topography with elevations varying from 3,000-5,000 feet above sea level, rising in the north-eastern districts to occasional altitudes of over 5,000 feet. The highest group of hills is the Muchinga Mountains which form part of the great escarpment running down the western edge of the Luangwa River Valley, and of these, individual peaks rise to about 8,000 feet. There are three great natural lakes: Lake Bangweulu in the northern district and Lakes Mweru and Tanganyika on the northern boundary of the Territory. Lake Bangweulu and its swamps cover an area of about 3,800 square miles. On the southern boundary lie the Victoria Falls, the largest waterfall in the world and, Lake Kariba, the largest man-made lake in the world; and on the northern boundary the second highest waterfall in Africa, the Kalambo Falls, 726 feet high. A large proportion of the Territory is covered with deciduous woodlands.

Climate
There are three distinct seasons—the rainy season from November until April, the winter season from about May to September and the hot season between September and November. The rainfall averages from 25 inches a year in the southern areas to over 50 inches in the north. In the hot season day temperatures may run from 80°-100° but at night there is a very distinct drop in the temperature.

History

Two early travellers in Northern Rhodesia deserve notice. The first was the Portuguese governor of Sena, Dr. de Lacerda, who led an expedition to Chief Kasembe’s capital on the eastern shores of Lake Mweru in 1798. Though he died before reaching his goal, his diaries provide the first authoritative account of what is now north-eastern Rhodesia. The second was Dr. Livingstone who travelled through Barotseland to Angola in 1851 and returned via Tete to Portuguese East Africa in 1855, discovering the Victoria Falls en route. He died at Chitambo, south of Lake Bangweulu, in May 1873. In the early part of the nineteenth century the Territory, sparsely occupied by Bantu tribes, was invaded by the Arabs from the north, the Ngoni branch of the Zulus from the south and the Kalolo who migrated from Basutoland. The Kalolo conquered what is now Barotseland but the indigenous Lozi later revolted and under Lewanika imposed their rule again.

In 1891 Lewanika was informed that the protection of Her Majesty’s Government had been extended to his country as he had requested that it should be and on 17th October 1900 the Barotse Concession was signed by him and his indunas and representatives of the Chartered Company. The concession was confirmed in due course by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and under its terms the Company acquired certain trading and mineral rights over the whole of Lewanika’s dominion, while the paramount chief was to receive, among other advantages, an annual subsidy.

The first task of the administration was the eradication of the slave trade conducted by the Arabs. In 1898 the last caravan was intercepted and the slaves freed and by 1906 Lewanika had agreed to the emancipation of the conquered tribes, whose status had been a mild form of slavery.

Before 1899 the whole Territory had been vaguely included in the Charter granted to the British South Africa Company but in that year the Barotseland-North-Western Rhodesia Order in Council placed the Company’s administration of the western portion of the country on a firm basis. It was closely followed by the North-Eastern Rhodesia Order in Council of 1900 which had a similar effect. The two territories were amalgamated in 1911 under the designation of Northern Rhodesia and the administration of the Company (subject to the exercise of certain powers of control by the Crown) continued until 1924. The capital was at Livingstone. In that year the administration of the Territory was assumed by the Crown in terms of a settlement arrived at between the Crown and the Company and the first Governor, Sir Herbert Stanley, was appointed on 1st April 1924. In 1935 the capital was moved to Lusaka.

Constitution

The Protectorate is one of the three Territories comprised in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (see page 165). To deal with territorial affairs there is an Executive Council and a Legislative Council.

Under the Constitution which came into force on 11th September 1962, the Executive Council contains 10 Ministers, each of whom is responsible for a group of departments. There are 4 ex-officio members: The Chief Secretary, Minister of Legal Affairs, Minister of Finance and Minister of Affairs. The remaining 6 Ministers are appointed by the Governor on Her Majesty’s instructions after consultation with the person or persons who appear to him most likely to command the support of the majority of elected members of the Legislative Council. Not less than 2 of the appointed Ministers must be Africans and not less than 2 must be Europeans.

The Legislative Council consists of a Speaker, 45 elected members, 6 official members, including the 4 ex-officio Ministers and 1 or 2 unofficial members nominated by the Governor. Of the elected members, 15 are returned from single member constituencies by voters registered under a higher franchise, and 15 are similarly returned by voters registered under a lower franchise; one is elected by voters of the Asian and coloured communities, and the remaining 14 are elected by the other, that is, African and European voters on both franchises voting together. These 14 members are returned from 7 two-member national constituencies and 4 of the national constituencies are each obliged to return one member who is an African and one who is a European; the other 3 national constituencies may return two members of any race. In order to qualify for any of these 14 seats, however, candidates are required to obtain the support of at least 10% of the voters of each race and 20% of the voters on one of the rolls; thereafter the voting power of the two rolls is equalised by averaging the percentage of votes on each obtained by the candidates.

If no candidate is successful in the election for a National seat, a by-election is held and if again no candidate is successful the seat remains vacant for the life of the Legislature.

For the general election of 30th October 1962, there were 129,585 registered voters, of whom 37,330 were registered under the higher franchise and 92,255 under the lower franchise.

The state of the parties in the Legislature is as follows:

- United Federal Party... ... ... 16 seats
- United National Independence Party 13 seats
- African National Congress ... ... 7 seats
- Asian Association ... ... ... 1 seat
- (Vacant) National seats ... ... 8

Land Policy

Land in the Territory, apart from Barotseland, is divided into (i) Native Reserves vested in perpetuity in the Secretary of State in trust for the African population; (ii) Native Trust Land also vested in the Secretary of State for the benefit of Africans but which may on certain conditions be temporarily alienated to non-natives; (iii) Crown Land. Crown Land in the City of Lusaka and Municipalities is alienated by Head Lease to the Local Authority which in turn sub-lets to an approved applicant. Crown Land in a township is alienated by direct lease from the Crown but subject to the recommendation of the Local Authority. A scheme for conversion to freehold on completion of the development required under the lease is in operation in most of the main urban areas. Crown Land for agricultural purposes is alienated on leasehold tenure to applicants who prove that they have the necessary finance and farming experience to make full use of the land. Under the provisions of the Agricultural Lands Ordinance the lessee of declared agricultural land may obtain a conditional freehold title to his farm on the fulfilment of the conditions laid down by the Ordinance. There is in certain areas freehold land which was granted in the early days.
Taxation

The Federal Government took over direct responsibility for the assessment and collection of income tax and customs and excise duties on the 1st April 1954.

Native tax is paid by all adult male Africans, unless exempted, and varies between 10s. and £1 per annum. There are, in addition, certain levies generally varying between 2s. and £1 per annum made by Native Authorities.

Public Finance

The establishment of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland on the 23rd October 1953 resulted in considerable changes in the Territory's financial responsibilities and arrangements. To conform with the Federal Government's financial year, which runs from the 1st July to the 30th June, the Territory's accounts were not closed on the 31st December 1953, the financial period being extended to the 30th June 1954.

The Territory retained its full revenue and met its full recurrent expenditure up to the 31st December 1953. For the six month period ended the 30th June 1954, revenue to which the Federal Government had become entitled was collected on behalf of that Government and paid over, except that the Federal Government took over direct responsibility for the assessment and collection of Income Tax and Customs and Excise Duties on the 1st April 1954. With effect from the 1st January 1954 the Federal Government assumed full financial responsibility for the Departments which it was due to take over and refunded to the Northern Rhodesia Government the full cost of administering them. The principal Departments and services taken over by the Federal Government in 1954 were as follows:

- Audit
- Civil Aviation
- Military
- Prisons
- Customs
- Income Tax
- Posts and Telegraphs
- European Education
- Health.

European Agriculture was taken over by the Federal Government from the 1st January 1956. Broadcasting, which was formerly a responsibility of the Information Department, was transferred to the control of the Federal Broadcasting Corporation on the 1st February 1958.

The main sources of revenue are now the payment received from the Federal Government representing 18% of the collections within the Federation on account of taxes on income and the Territorial surcharge on Company Income Tax assessments also collected by the Federal Government on behalf of the Northern Rhodesia Government. These two taxes represent 56.8% of the estimated revenue for 1962-63 and a further 13.3% is derived from mineral royalties. The Northern Rhodesian Government no longer collects Customs and Excise duties. These are levied by the Federal Government and not shared with the other Territories of the Federation.

Expenditure up to 1957-58 included the following appropriations:

| Year       | Development Fund (£) | Capital Fund (£) |

The Public Debt of Northern Rhodesia as at 30th June 1962 was as in the table above, responsibility for servicing and repaying a substantial portion having been assumed by the Federal Government.

Currency

Up to the 23rd April 1957 the currency normally used was issued by the Southern Rhodesia Currency Board and was common to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The denominations were 10s., £1, 5s and 10s notes, cupro-nickel or silver threepenny pieces, sixpences, shillings, florins and half-crowns.

On the 23rd April 1957 however, the Bank of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, which took over the assets of the Central Africa Currency Board on the 1st April 1956 commenced the issue of new currency notes of the denominations of 10s., £1, 5s and £10. The two types of currency now circulate together, but the new will gradually replace the old as the latter becomes unfit for circulation. As from the 1st January 1955 British coins ceased to be legal tender in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.
Development Plan

The Northern Rhodesia Government has approved a Development Plan for the period from 1st July 1961 to 30th June 1965, which envisages the expenditure of £30 million. Funds have been allocated as follows:

| Economic Development—Rural Areas | 10,500,000 |
|---------------------------------|------------|
| Economic Development—Crown Land Settlement | 400,000 |
| Economic Development—Urban Areas and Rural Townships | 10,388,000 |
| African Education and Staff Training | 5,000,000 |
| Administrative and General Services | 3,712,000 |

Total: £30,000,000

Education

Non-African education and all higher education became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July 1954.

In July 1961 there were 58 Government schools and 12 Government-aided private schools providing education for European children. Ten of the Government schools and one private school provided education up to the Cambridge School Certificate standard.

The enrolment in European Government schools was 15,194; in Government-aided private schools, 2,302. Technical education for apprentices is provided at Broken Hill, Lusaka and Livingstone. Government assistance in the form of scholarships, bursaries, grants and loans is available under certain conditions for higher education. European, Asian and Coloured students from Northern Rhodesia attend the Teachers’ Training College at Heany, near Bulawayo, and the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in Salisbury.

There were 13 Government primary and secondary schools and one Government-aided private school for Asian and Coloured children. The total enrolment of Asians was 1,712; and of Coloureds, 525.

No exact figures are available for the number of African children in each age group. It is estimated that in the primary school age group (7 years to 14 years inclusive) there are approximately 525,000 children, of whom 62% are in school. In the secondary age group (15–19 years) there are estimated to be 266,000 children. Of these 6,433 are either in secondary schools or undergoing some form of vocational training at schools or colleges aided or maintained by the Ministry of African Education.

The enrolment in the various types of schools in December 1961 was:

| African Schools | No. of schools | No. of pupils etc. |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Aided or maintained primary schools | 1,630 | 298,693 |
| Unaided primary schools | 46 | 6,135 |
| Secondary schools | 33 | 3,794 |
| Teacher training schools | 12 | 1,211 |
| Trades and technical schools | 19 | 1,093 |
| Other vocational schools (girls) | 13 | 335 |

There were five post-secondary courses in operation (with some 115 pupils), namely a Sixth Form at Munali and Chipembi Secondary Schools and three courses at the Chalimbana Teacher Training College, one for the training of teachers for the upper primary schools and two for training junior secondary school teachers. Bursaries are awarded by both the Federal Government and the Northern Rhodesia Government for students to attend various courses of advanced education. In September 1962 there were 79 such students in Africa and the United Kingdom. There were 37 students attending courses in the United Kingdom, Australia, India and the United States on Commonwealth, U.S.A., British Council or India Government Bursaries.

Rhodes-Livingstone Institute, Museum, etc.

The Institute, with headquarters at Lusaka, has conducted social research in British Central Africa since 1938. While emphasis is placed on the study of the reaction of African peoples to modern social and economic conditions, research into the problems of the immigrant races is also undertaken. Since 1st April 1962 the Institute has been incorporated into the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.

The Rhodes-Livingstone Museum at Livingstone is Northern Rhodesia’s National Museum and tells the story of the Territory from the Stone Age to modern times. The library contains approximately 6,000 volumes which are available to members of the Northern Rhodesia Society.

The aims of the Northern Rhodesia Society are to promote the study of ethnology, history, geography, natural history and kindred sciences in their relation to Northern Rhodesia.

Health

Territorial health services became the responsibility of the Federal Government on 1st July 1954.

Government medical facilities in the Territory include two central hospitals, situated at Lusaka and Kitwe, offering facilities for all races, and General hospitals at Livingstone, Broken Hill and Ndola offering facilities for all races. There are also 18 district hospitals, the majority of which have a medical officer in attendance, and 28 rural hospitals.

In addition to the hospital facilities described above there are 133 rural health centres and 35 urban clinics.

During 1961 a total of 179,677 patients were admitted to Federal Government hospitals. Attendances of out-patients at Federal Government institutions totalled 9,291,917.

The first stage of reconstruction of Lusaka Central Hospital was completed, and opened on
20th June 1962. This stage provides the first 200 beds of what it is hoped will eventually be an 800 bedded hospital for all races and includes surgical and X-ray facilities.

The planning of extensions to the Ndola General Hospital to give an additional 350 beds is well advanced.

The Mental Hospital at Lusaka was completed and opened on 20th June 1962 with accommodation for 160 mental patients.

Communications

During 1954 the Federal Government assumed responsibility for civil aviation, inter-territorial main roads and certain other aspects of communications.

There are main airports at Livingstone, Lusaka and Ndola with bituminous surfaced runways and one at Kasama with gravel runway, all of which lie on the north and south corridor through the Territory. Subsidiary airfields serve most of the outlying districts.

The Rhodesia Railways line runs north and south from the Congo border (near Sakania) to the Victoria Falls. Branch lines serve the copper mines from Ndola. The total length of permanent way is 655 miles.

The total mileage of roads in the Territory maintained from public funds at the 31st December 1961 was 21,518 made up as follows:

| Miles |
|-------|
| Inter-territorial main roads | 1,929·3 |
| Territorial main roads | 1,926·6 |
| District roads | 13,921·9 |
| Native Authority roads | 3,740·2 |

There are 753·3 miles of Class 1 (bituminous surface) standard. This total includes main roads through townships.

The undertaking previously vested in the Zambezi River Transport Service Board of Control has been sold to a private company which will continue to provide road-river services between Livingstone and Mongu.

Broadcasting

All broadcasting in the Federation is undertaken by the Federal Broadcasting Corporation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, a statutory body created by the Broadcasting Act of 1957.

The Corporation has three services, i.e., the General Service (English), the Commercial Service (English) and the African Service which includes an element of commercial broadcasting.

There are studios in Lusaka, Salisbury, Bulawayo, Blantyre and Kitwe and programmes are broadcast on medium and shortwave transmitters situated in the major centres of the Federation.

The total hours broadcast in the African Service is 206 per week and these programmes are transmitted in English and nine vernaculars: Nyanja, Bemba, Tonga, Lozi, Tumbuka, Lunda and Luvale for Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and Shona and Sindebele for Southern Rhodesia. English is the medium for three hours each weekday and for eight hours each Sunday. There is simultaneous broadcasting in six languages between 4.00 p.m. and 10 p.m. daily in the three Regions.

It is estimated that there are more than one million listeners amongst the African people and regular daily listening is done at peak periods.

News is brought to the listeners in English and in nine vernaculars in the 23 daily bulletins broadcast in the African Service.

Main Crops and Products

The main African-grown cash crops are maize, tobacco and groundnuts. Sorghum, millets and cassava are among the main subsistence crops. Small quantities of rice, cotton, pulses, fruits, vegetables, wheat and beeswax are also produced.

Main Crops—Known Sales

| African | 1960–61 |
|---------|---------|
| Maize—000 tons | 85·3 |
| Groundnuts—000 tons | 12 |
| Tobacco—Turkish—000 lbs. | 194 |

In 1961 the approximate number of cattle owned by Europeans was 213,000. African owned livestock totalled 1,070,460 cattle, 164,400 sheep and goats and 62,900 pigs. More than 75,000 head of cattle were slaughtered by licensed butcheries during the year.

The fishing industry is primarily an African concern and plays an important part in the economy of rural areas. Lakes Bangweulu and Mweru and the rivers Kafue, Luapula and Zambezi provide large quantities of fish, most of which is transported to line-of-rail centres, either dry or preserved on ice. Fishing is being stimulated on the Southern Sector of Lakes Tanganyika and Kariba.

Output of sawlogs, poles and firewood amounted to 192,772 tons in 1961.

A large variety of products is now being manufactured in the Territory. Main manufactures are cement products, tiles, steel and wood furniture, steel finishing work, beer, mineral waters, metal castings and nuts and bolts; sugar, plastics, copperware, nails, dry ice, sweets and boat building.

Trade

With the assumption by the Federal Government in 1954 of the control of imports and the promotion and control of exports no separate figures for Northern Rhodesia are available. Statistics for the whole Federation are published, however, in the "Annual Statement of External Trade." The Federal Government has recently increased customs duties over a wide field of imports to give protection to local industries.

Internal trading continues to improve. Higher wages, especially on the Copperbelt, have raised the purchasing power of Africans and this is reflected in increased turnover. The agricultural industry has, overall, experienced favourable conditions and sales of agricultural implements are higher. Exports of such items as blankets and batteries to neighbouring countries have been maintained.

The mainstay of the economy, however, continues to be the primary industries of mining and agriculture, and the principal exports, copper, maize and tobacco. The amount of copper produced or made available for sale is regulated in order to help balance the world supply and demand position of this commodity.

Local industrial products include steel and metal work, cement, soap, furniture, oxygen and acetylene, clothing and blankets, boat building, plastics, and car batteries. There are also in operation an iron-foundry, saw-mills, a recently established pottery, a brewery, a sweet factory, and a sugar refinery. New construction and development continue at a high rate in the mining industry, and Government has made considerable provision in its £30 million Development Plan to assist the development of agriculture in rural areas from a subsistence basis towards commercial operation in a cash economy.
Co-operative and Marketing Organizations

The year 1961 has been one of consolidation, the number of societies has remained virtually the same, although membership has risen once more for the fifteenth successive year.

The total number of societies registered at 31st December 1961 was 228 with a European and African aggregate membership of 36,413. Paid-up share capital and deposits amounted to £750,266. Combined turnover of all societies amounted to £8,453,252.

Marketing organizations handled 560,164 bags of maize and 7,400 bags of other produce, plus 3,167 lbs. of cotton valued at £908,493.

The principal products handled were maize, wheat, beans, cowpeas, sunflower, sunhemp, Kaffircorn, rupoko, bulrush millet, cassava flour, groundnuts, rice, potatoes, velvet beans, peas, pigeon peas, soya beans, vegetables, tobacco, milk, cheese, butter, cream, eggs, dried fish, pig by-products and coffee.
