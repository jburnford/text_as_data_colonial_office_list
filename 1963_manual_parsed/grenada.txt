GRENA DA

Area

The total area of the Colony is 133 square miles.
In addition to the island of Grenada it includes
certain of the small islands known as the Grena-
dines, the largest of which, Carriacou, has an area
of about 13 square miles.

Population

The population at the census on 7th April 1960
of 88,677 is for the most part coloured. There is a
small white population, a number of Indians and a
small community of the descendants of early white
settlers.

Principal Town

The capital, St. George's, has a population of
7,305.

Geographical Features

In structure, Grenada is a moderately eroded
volcanic pile. In general it consists of a somewhat
disordered topography of mountains and fairly
deep, steep-sided valleys. A backbone of
mountains traverses the whole length, closer to
the western than the eastern coastline. The
highest points are Mt. St. Catherine (2,749 feet),
Fedon's Camp (2,512 feet) and Morne Quaqua
(2,412 feet). From the north-east end and along
the east and south-east the mountains slope
gradually towards the sea. The south coast is
deeply indented by numerous natural harbours.
The island is well-watered by quick-flowing
streams. Approximately 10,000 acres are under
forest. A small lake, the Grand Etang (approxi-
mately 36 acres), lies at a height of about 1,800
feet in the centre of the Island.

Climate

Rainfall is low in the coastal areas and high in
the mountains of the interior, with an average
range of 60 to 150 inches per annum. The months
January to May are relatively dry, June to
December relatively wet, August being the driest
month and November the wettest.

History

Grenada was discovered by Columbus in 1498.
It was originally inhabited by Caribs. A company
of London merchants attempted to form a
settlement in 1609 but were so harassed by the
Caribs that the attempt was abandoned. Grenada
was, however, included in the Carlisle Grant of
1627. In 1650, Du Parquet, Governor of Mar-
tinique, purchased the island from the French
West India Company to whom it had been granted
by the King of France and established a settlement
at St. George's. This venture did not pay and Du
Parquet sold the island to the Comte De Cerillac
from whom it was in turn purchased in 1665 by the
French Company and passed to the Crown of
France in 1674.

Conquered by the British in 1762, the island
was formally ceded to the British Crown by the
Treaty of Paris in 1763. In 1779, England being
preoccupied with the American War of Inde-
pendence, Grenada was retaken by the French,
but restored to Britain by the Treaty of Versailles
in 1783 and re-occupied in 1784. In 1795-96 a
rebellion against British rule was instigated by
a French Republican from Guadeloupe. The
rising was suppressed in 1796 and since then there
has been peace in Grenada.

Constitution

The constitutional arrangements are the same
as in Antigua (see page 69).

Taxation

Forms of direct taxation include income tax,
estate duties and property tax. Income tax is
based on a graduated scale, varying from 5 cents
to 65 cents in the $ for individuals (on chargeable
income for the year immediately preceding the
year of assessment). Companies pay at the rate
of 40%. There is a land tax of 50 cents per acre
on 1 to 10 acres, 75 cents per acre on 10 to 100
acres and $1.00 per acre on 100 acres and over;
and house tax is levied on a sliding scale varying
from $1·20 per house of rental value between $24
and $28·80 per annum to $8 in the case of houses
with rental value over $144 per annum. Other
forms of taxation include import, export and
excise duties and purchase tax.

Public Finance

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1957 | $4,575,584 | $5,093,817 |
| 1958 | $5,467,867 | $5,899,994 |
| 1959 | $7,482,470 | $7,005,526 |
| 1960 | $8,115,021 | $7,656,046 |
| 1961 | $8,053,479 | $8,190,395 |

At the end of 1961 the Public Debt amounted to
$12,716,450 (including a Hurricane Rehabilitation
Loan from the United Kingdom Government of
$7,200,000) and accumulated Sinking Funds to
$1,018,851.

Currency

The currency of the Colony is the West Indian
dollar which is linked to sterling at the rate of
$4·80 to the £.

Notes issued by the Eastern Caribbean Currency
Board were introduced in 1951 when the Wind-
ward Islands joined with the other British
territories in the Eastern Caribbean (Barbados;
British Guiana, the Leeward Islands and
Trinidad) in a common currency.

Notes issued by the Government of Trinidad
and Tobago, Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial
and Overseas) and the Royal Bank of Canada
continue as legal tender but are being withdrawn
and the banks' powers of note issue have been
terminated. Meanwhile United Kingdom coinage
has also largely been replaced by the Board's own dollar coinage, though the diminishing United Kingdom coinage continues as legal tender.

Development Plans

Under the 1945, 1950 and 1955 Colonial Development and Welfare Acts Grenada received allocations totalling £1,131,121; a further allocation of £540,000 was made under the 1959 Act.

Other Development

Progress has been made in the direction of attracting external investment for the development of the tourist industry which the Colony is not in a position to finance. A step forward has also been made in setting out Government's policy regarding Morne Rouge development in the interest of tourism.

Education

There were 56 primary schools in the Colony, with rolls totalling 23,706 pupils at 31st December 1961. Average attendance in 1961 was 19,116 or 79·3% of the total enrolment. Compulsory attendance is not at present enforced. Eleven of the primary schools are maintained entirely by Government, the remainder are under denominational control and receive grants-in-aid from public funds. Government is at present pursuing a policy of gradual replacement of dilapidated buildings by Government-owned buildings of an approved standard and model. The actual operation of such schools, however, will remain under denominational control by written agreement.

There are three handicraft centres. In addition four schools have well-equipped handicraft rooms. There are also four domestic science centres, with adequate facilities provided at five other schools. A visual education unit serves the whole Colony. A filmstrip library service with four projectors is maintained. Six secondary schools (one Government and five grant-aided) have a total roll of 1,786 (end 1961). Two of the schools are for boys only, three for girls only and one is co-educational. All secondary schools teach up to the School Certificate and G.C.E. standard and the Grenada Boys' Secondary School, the Presentation Boys' College, the St. Joseph's Convent, St. George's and the Anglican High School also prepare pupils for the Cambridge Higher School Certificate examination. The cost to Government of primary and secondary education during 1961 was $999,898.

The Government awards, among others, two biennial island scholarships, one tenable at a university in the British Commonwealth, open to both male and female candidates; and one tenable at the University of The West Indies Faculty of Agriculture.

Libraries, etc.

There is a free public library in St. George's and branch libraries in each parish. In addition there is an island-wide book mobile service.

Health

A WHO Campaign for the eradication of *Aedes Aegypti* was started in 1953 and completed at the end of March 1962 with great success and with only the island of Carriacou still positive. In March 1961 Dr. Van Seventer, a WHO Entomologist conducted an *Aedes Aegypti* survey in Carriacou for the purpose of finding a proper insecticide to complete the Eradication Phase. Since then regular perifocal treatment has been conducted. There has been no reported case of malaria either from this island or the mainland.

The WHO-UNICEF also assisted with the B.C.G. campaign in 1954, with follow-up in 1955 and 1956 and subsequent incorporation of the programme into the normal activities of the Health Department; also with a scheme for the supplementary feeding of school children, expectant and nursing mothers: the last is still in progress.

In 1956 a treponematosis campaign was undertaken with the object of eradication of yaws and a reduction in the incidence of venereal diseases. Evaluation and surveillance which have been continuing since then have shown that yaws has been eradicated.

The Colony Hospital of 240 beds is at St. George's. The Princess Alice Hospital, St. Andrew's, is a modern building, recently constructed and provides 32 beds. Addition of a Children's Ward is soon to be undertaken. The district hospital in Carriacou which was completely destroyed by the hurricane of 22nd September 1955 has been rebuilt and was opened on 16th July 1958. It has been named the Princess Royal Hospital.

There are 26 district Medical Visiting Stations throughout the Colony with resident nurse-midwives in charge. Maternity and child welfare work is carried on in all these stations. There are three main Health Centres at St. George's, Gouyave and St. David's, and in four of the Visiting Stations accommodation has been improved to provide subsidiary Health Centres.

Expenditure on medical and sanitary services in 1961 amounted to $1,025,291 compared with $97,987 in 1935.

Communications

The airfield is at Pearls and has a runway 5,280 feet long by 150 feet wide. The Colony is served regionally by Leeward Islands Air Transport with a twice-weekly service and by British West Indian Airways with twenty flights weekly; scheduled connections being available to North and South America and Europe.

There are approximately 495 miles of good roads divided into four classes: Class I—190½ miles, Class II—93½ miles, Class III—83½ miles, Class IV—124½. About 400 miles have an oiled surface. There are no railways.

The chief port is St. George's which possesses a good harbour. Part of this harbour, called the inner harbour, is well sheltered with a deep-water pier 800 feet long and minimum draft of 30 feet alongside. The entrance to this inner harbour is through a channel 600 feet wide with a minimum depth of 45 feet. Other ports include Grenville and Hillsborough, Carriacou, but these are mostly used by small craft.

Regular cargo services are provided by Harrison Line Steamers and by vessels chartered by Geest Industries Limited from United Kingdom ports; by the Saguenay Shipping Company from Canadian ports; by the Booth Lamport and Holt and American Defence Lines from the United States ports and by the Royal Netherlands Steamship Company from European ports. The Federal Shipping Service together with several
small motor vessels, auxiliary and sailing vessels take care of the cargo services between the islands and also provide a useful passenger service.

Several foreign ships make frequent calls at this port to take immigrants to the United Kingdom. Passenger travel to the U.S.A. and Canada, however, has to be made through Trinidad or Barbados.

Total shipping for 1961 was 695 motor and steamships of 932,942 net registered tons, of which 336 ships of 311,191 net registered tons were British.

There were also 470 British sailing and auxiliary motor ships of 15,863 net registered tons.

Broadcasting

A Broadcasting Service for the Windward Islands, with headquarters in St. George's, Grenada, was inaugurated in 1955. Transmissions take place on short waves from a 5 kW transmitter and cover the Eastern Caribbean.

The capital outlay on these stations, and the running costs for the first few years, have been provided from Colonial Development and Welfare funds.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

A Government-operated Central Marketing Organization was initiated in 1951 for the purchase, sale and, where necessary, storage of surplus quantities of locally grown foodcrops. The nutmeg industry is controlled by the Grenada Co-operative Nutmeg Association which purchases, processes and markets all nutmegs and mace produced in the Colony.

In 1955 a statutory body, the Grenada Banana Co-operative Society, was set up to control the production and marketing of bananas.

One farmers' society and eight fishermen's unions were registered under the Friendly Societies Ordinance in 1954.

A Co-operative Department was established in 1957. It now consists of a Registrar of Cooperatives, a Co-operatives Officer, 2 Junior Co-operatives Officers and two clerks. The Department is responsible for promotion work as well as registration, supervision and audit.
