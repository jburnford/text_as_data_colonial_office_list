### ST. LUCIA

#### Area and Population

According to recent aerial surveys, the area is about 238 square miles. The population at the 1960 Census was 86,108.

| Principal Town | Census Population |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Castries (capital) | 4,353 |

#### Geographical Features

The island is mountainous, with magnificent scenery. The highest peak is Mt. Gimie (3,145 feet); the most spectacular are the Gros Piton (2,619 feet) and the Petit Piton (2,461 feet) which are old volcanic, forest clad cones rising sheer out of the sea near the town of Soufrière on the leeward coast. A few miles away in an ancient crater are hot, sulphurous springs. The mountains are intersected by numerous short rivers. In places, these rivers debouch into broad, fertile and well cultivated valleys.

#### Climate

There is a dry season roughly from January to April, and a rainy season from May to August, with an Indian summer in September–October. Towards the end of the year it is usually wet. The island lies in latitudes where the north-east trade winds are an almost constant influence.

#### History

Neither the date of discovery, nor the discoverer, of St. Lucia is known, for according to the evidence of Columbus's voyages, he appears to have missed the island. As early as 1605, 67 Englishmen en route to Guiana, touched at St. Lucia and made an unsuccessful effort to settle. The island at the time was peopled by Caribs and continued in their possession till 1635, when it was granted by the King of France to MM. de L'Olive and Duplessis. In 1638 the first recorded settlement was made by English from Bermuda and St. Kitts but the colonists were murdered by the Caribs about three years later.

In 1642 the King of France, still claiming a right of sovereignty over the island, ceded it to the French West India Company, who in 1650 sold it to MM. Honel and Du Parquet. After repeated attempts by the Caribs to expel the French, the latter concluded a treaty of peace with them in 1660.

In 1664 Thomas Warner, son of the Governor of St. Kitts, made a descent on St. Lucia. The English continued in possession till the Peace of Breda in 1667, when the island was restored to the French. In 1674 it was re-annexed to the Crown of France, and made a dependency of Martinique.

After the Peace of Utrecht, in 1713, the rival pretensions of England and France to the possession of St. Lucia resulted in open hostility. In 1718 the Regent, d'Orleans, made a grant of the island to Marshal d'Estrées, and in 1722, the King of England made a grant of it to the Duke of Montague. In the following year, however, a body of troops, despatched to St. Lucia by the Governor of Martinique, compelled the English settlers to evacuate the island and it was declared neutral.
In 1743 the French took advantage of the declaration of war to resume possession of St. Lucia, which they retained till the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, when it was again declared neutral. In 1756, on the renewal of hostilities, the French put the island in a state of defence; but in 1762 it surrendered to the joint operations of Admiral Rodney and General Monckton. In the following year, by the Treaty of Paris, it was assigned to the French, who continued in peaceable possession till 1778, when effective measures were taken by the British for its conquest, but by the Peace of Versailles, St. Lucia was once more restored to France.

In 1793, on the declaration of war against revolutionary France, the West Indies became the scene of a series of naval and military operations which resulted in the surrender of St. Lucia to the British on 4th April 1794. In 1796 the British Government despatched to the relief of their West Indian possessions a body of troops, 12,000 strong, under the command of Sir Ralph Abercrombie, supported by a squadron under Admiral Sir Hugh Christian. On 26th April these forces appeared off St. Lucia, and after an obstinate and sanguinary contest, which lasted till 26th May, the Republican party, which had been aided by insurgent slaves under Victor Hugues, laid down their arms and surrendered as prisoners of war. The British retained possession of St. Lucia till 1802, when it was restored to France by the Treaty of Amiens; but on the renewal of hostilities it surrendered by capitulation to General Grinfield on 22nd June 1803 was finally ceded to Britain in 1814 by the Treaty of Paris, and has since continued under British rule.

**Constitution**

The constitutional arrangements are the same as in Antigua (see page 69).

**Taxation**

The main form of direct taxation is income tax. Income tax rates vary on a sliding scale from £12c. in every $4·80 of the first $480·00, to $3·12 in every $4·80 above $24,000. Companies pay $1·60 in every $4·80 on their chargeable income.

**Public Finance**

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1957 | $5,527,426 | $5,921,946 |
| 1958 | $5,259,072 | $5,509,128 |
| 1959 | $6,590,929 | $6,067,692 |
| 1960 | $8,169,878 | $7,435,175 |
| 1961 | $8,489,498 | $8,018,129 |

In 1961 37·7% of revenue was derived from Customs and Excise duties and 11·8% from direct taxes. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Social Services: $1,710,984
- Administration: $297,707
- Public Works: $1,167,897
- Development: $1,696,681

The Public Debt of the Colony at 31st December 1961 stood at $5,856,141 which includes $3,030,096 loaned for Castries and Soufrière Reconstruction, plus Economic Loan of $2,006,400. The accumulated Sinking Funds towards its redemption stood at $2,020,303.

**Currency** (see under Antigua—page 69).

**Development Plans**

During 1962 schemes totalling $1,534,310·40 (£319,648) were approved under the C.D.&W. Development Programme 1960–64. These schemes fell under the following heads:

| Category       | Amount     |
|----------------|------------|
| Administration | $52,699    |
| Production     | $870,590   |
| Communications | $341,568   |
| Social Services| $269,453   |

Under the agreement concluded at the United States Bases Talks on 10th December 1960, a total sum of $450,000 U.S. currency was made available to the Government of St. Lucia for the construction of roads, the establishment of a secondary school, and rural development in the Southern area of the island. Some of these projects are now being implemented.

**Education**

There are two secondary schools with 790 pupils on roll and fifty-two primary and infant schools which cater for pupils from 4 to 15 years of age. The number of children on roll in these schools is 20,766. Adult education is provided by the Extra Mural Department of the U.C.W.I. and by organised voluntary groups. Community education centres provide facilities whereby the people of the area can meet to discuss matters of common interest and to take part in recreational activities.

An Adult Education Officer attached to the Education Department was appointed in 1960 and her duties include: (a) The organisation of classes and courses suited to the ability, interest and needs of adults; (b) the co-ordination of existing services providing adult education in the community.

The total expenditure for 1961 was $758,900·42 compared with $32,122 in 1935.

**Libraries**

There is a Central Library in Castries and a branch library in Soufrière. Small branches are also maintained in the towns and villages.

**Health**

The most prevalent diseases are heart diseases, diseases of early infancy, tuberculosis, helminthic diseases and venereal diseases.

Malaria has been virtually eradicated as a result of an Insect Control Campaign carried out with W.H.O. and U.N.I.C.E.F. assistance.

A five-year Environmental Sanitation Programme was started in 1959 with assistance from W.H.O. and U.N.I.C.E.F. The aim of the programme is to provide safe excreta disposal systems and water supplies in all rural areas of the Island. Up to August 1962, 5,580 latrines were put down, and it is fully expected that the programme will be completed by March 1964.

With the assistance of the two Peace Corps Health Educators and the Adult Education Committee, Health Education Programmes on an island wide basis are being gradually introduced. Health Education, as part of the curriculum for schools, will be introduced in 1963.
Available hospital beds amount to 158 general, 50 tuberculosis, 140 in the mental hospital and 120 in a home for the aged and infirm.

Communications

There are two airfields in St. Lucia—Vigie Airport and Beane Field Airport. Vigie Airport is owned and operated by the Government of St. Lucia for scheduled and charter services while Beane Field is owned by the Government of the United States of America. By agreement with the Government of the United States of America, Beane Field may be used for any service when it becomes expedient to do so.

Air services with other territories are maintained by British West Indian Airways and Leeward Islands Air Transport, and it is expected that by the end of the year, Pan-American Airways will have commenced a twice weekly service into St. Lucia. B.W.I.A. is owned by the Trinidad Government and L.I.A.T. is a subsidiary of B.W.I.A. Charter services are undertaken by these companies, principally between the Eastern Caribbean Governments and the Governments of Jamaica and Trinidad. Migrants and tourist charter flights are undertaken by various companies.

The runway at Vigie Airport was lengthened from 4,500 feet to 5,700 feet. This work was completed in 1960.

The total mileage of the island's road system is 401.

The island is served by the following main Shipping Lines from Europe:

- Harrison Lines—Cargo Vessels.
- Geest Industries—Cargo and Passenger Vessels.
- French Lines—Passenger Vessels.

Numerous Inter-island Craft are the main means of communication with neighbouring islands.

During 1961, 1,473 vessels called at St. Lucia. Gross tonnage handled was 1,395,041.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is engaged in agriculture (20,000). Other gainful occupations are fishing (1,200), manufacturing (4,500), public services (1,400), lumbering (200), transportation (2,000), commerce (3,000) and domestic service (3,500).

There were 10 registered trade unions at the end of 1961.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are bananas, coconuts, sugar cane, cocoa, fruit, nutmegs, mace, ground provision and citrus.

Livestock estimates are: cattle 9,500, pigs 13,200, sheep 7,000, goats 4,000, horses, mules and donkeys 1,000, poultry 90,000.

There is a fair amount of fishing, but the supply of fish does not meet the demand. The number of fishing boats has decreased and also the number of fishing days. A fishing scheme is now in operation.

The principal manufactures are sugar, rum, citrus products, coconut products (copra and edible oil, soap), cigarettes and mineral waters.
