BARBADOS

Area, etc.

Barbados is the most easterly of the Caribbean islands. Its total area is 166 square miles.

Population

On the 31st December 1961, the estimated population was 241,706.

Principal Town

Bridgetown, the capital, is the only town. Before the 1960 census its population was estimated at about 11,304.

Geographical Features

The Island is comparatively flat, rising in a series of tablelands marked by well-defined terraces to the highest point (1,104 feet) at Mount Hillaby. The north-east corner of the Island, the Scotland area, is broken country, much eroded and rather barren. The formation of the rest of the Island is coral limestone. There are no rivers, but deep gullies which fill with water during heavy rain have cut their way through the coral terraces in many places. Indigenous forest covers about 46 acres.

Climate

The climate is extremely pleasant. North-easterly trade winds blow steadily from December to June but during the remainder of the year, the wet season, the wind moves to the south-east and is less strong, resulting in humid, hotter conditions. The average temperature is 79°-8°. The rainfall is very varied: in the high central district the yearly average is 75 inches while in some of the low-lying coastal areas the average is 50 inches.

History

Uncertainty remains on some points in the early history of Barbados and differing versions have appeared from time to time. The brief account which follows is based on what is taken to be the most authentic version.

As far as is known the original inhabitants were the Arawak Indians who migrated from the mainland of South America. When they arrived is not known, but relics of their occupation down to the latter years of the sixteenth century have been discovered in various parts of the Island. By the time the English settlers came they had disappeared, partly through Carib raids from the neighbouring islands, and partly through the Spaniards who deported them to work in the mines of Hispaniola.

In spite of the belief to the contrary, there is no satisfactory evidence that the Olive Branch under Captain Catlin ever touched at Barbados when it was driven off its course from England to the River Wapoco settlement in 1605 and fetched up at St. Lucia. The first Englishman to visit Barbados may have been Captain Simon Gordan, who claimed that he had landed some time before the settlement of 1627 and had found the Island uninhabited. He may, however, have been on a ship under the command of Sir Thomas Warner that visited sometime between 1620 and 1624 and found the Island suffering from such a severe drought that the latter preferred settlement of his colonists at St. Kitts. In 1624 or early 1625 a ship, belonging to Sir William Courteen and under the command of Captain John Powell, touched at Barbados, when en route from Pernambuco to England; some men were landed who erected a cross and on a tree nearby inscribed “James K. of E. and of this Island”. On receiving Powell’s information about Barbados Sir William Courteen fitted out an expedition to the Island under the command of his informant; but Powell, who carried letters of marque, captured a Spanish or Portuguese prize and returned with it to Cowes in 1626. Courteen then fitted out a second expedition and in February
1627, the William and John under the command of Captain Henry Powell—Captain John Powell's younger brother—landed 80 settlers. During 1627 and 1628 the colony grew rapidly and by the end of 1628 it was claimed that Courteen had planted 1,850 settlers. The Earl of Carlisle obtained a grant from Charles I for all the Caribbean islands and landed settlers in 1628. After his death his son leased the Island in 1647 for 21 years to Lord Willoughby of Parham who assumed the government of the Island and during the Civil War held it for the Royalists until his capitulation to the Cromwellian fleet in 1652. A Governor was appointed by the Commonwealth in place of Lord Willoughby and at the Restoration the claims of the Carlisle Patent were revived. An agreement was reached by which the Patent was surrendered to the Crown for compensation in the form of 4½% duty on exports. This duty was a continual source of complaint but was not abolished until 1838 by Act of Imperial Parliament. The importance of the agreement, however, is that it marked the end of proprietary rule. Since its settlement Barbados has been a possession of Great Britain.

**Constitution**

Barbados has one of the oldest constitutions in the Commonwealth and one in which conventions play an important part. Amendments to the constitution providing for full internal self-government came into operation on the 16th October 1961.

The Legislature consists of the Governor; an Upper House—The Legislative Council—consisting of members (usually about 15) appointed by Her Majesty; and a Lower House—the House of Assembly—consisting of 24 members elected by universal adult suffrage. Members of the Legislative Council may be appointed for periods of up to 15 years but are normally appointed for five years at a time. The life of a House of Assembly is limited to five years.

The revised Constitutional Instruments include provision for a change in name of the Executive Council to the Privy Council; formal provision for the Cabinet; and the establishment of Judicial and Legal Service, Public Service and Police Service Commissions with executive powers to deal with appointments, dismissals and disciplinary control of members of the services for which they are responsible.

The Privy Council consists of the Governor, the Attorney-General and other members (at present four, including the Premier) appointed by Her Majesty. It advises the Governor in the exercise of the Royal Prerogative of Mercy and in the exercise of his disciplinary powers over members of the Public Service and the Police Service who may appeal to the Privy Council against disciplinary action taken against them.

The Executive Committee consists of the Governor, the Attorney-General, not less than one member of the Legislative Council (at present one) and not less than four members of the House of Assembly (at present six). Since most of the powers and functions of the Governor-in-Executive Committee have been delegated to Ministers or to the Cabinet, the Executive Committee now survives for a limited number of largely formal functions only.

The Cabinet consists of the Premier and not less than five other Ministers (at present six) appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Premier, and it is the principal instrument of policy.

The Governor appoints as Premier the person who appears to him to be best able to command a majority in the House of Assembly. On the Premier's advice the Governor also appoints other Ministers who become the members of the Executive Committee appointed from the House of Assembly, and a Minister without Portfolio who becomes the member of the Executive Committee appointed from the Legislative Council.

**Land Policy**

The systems of land tenure are similar to those of the United Kingdom.

**Taxation**

Income tax is the main form of direct taxation. The tax rates range from 3 cents on every complete $ of taxable income up to $500, to 75 cents on every complete $ of taxable income beyond $24,000. Tax is not paid on incomes below $800 per annum in the case of single individuals and $1,400 in the case of married persons. A wife's earned income allowance not exceeding $300 is granted. Deductions from taxable income of $270 to $600, varying according to the age of the child, are allowed for children and $240 for other dependants, in the latter case not exceeding two. Deductions are also permitted in respect of life insurances paid. Medical expenses may be deducted in excess of $20 but not exceeding in the aggregate $100, in the case of a tax-payer of married status, or $50 in the case of any other person, plus $25 for each child, not exceeding two. Companies pay a flat rate of 40%. The rate for life assurance companies and building societies is the average paid by an individual with a taxable income of $4,800.

A non-cumulative system of Pay As You Earn is in operation.

Estate duties range from 1% on estates exceeding $4,800 and not exceeding $14,400 to 30% on estates over $1,920,000. In addition, succession duty ranges from ½% between $96 and $2,400 to 2% of values exceeding $9,600 where the successor is a lineal descendant or ancestor and from 2% to 10% where the successor is a stranger.

Entertainment tax is charged on certain forms of entertainment.

The other main forms of taxation are the Customs tariffs and excise duty on rum production.

The West Indian $ is fixed at 4s. 2d., that is $4·80 to £1 sterling.

Development Plans

The Legislature has approved a development programme for 1962-65 envisaging a total expenditure of $50·2 million as follows:

| Category                                      | ($ million) |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|

| **Total**                                    | **50·2**    |

The aim of the plan is the promotion of the Island's economic development resulting in increased production and higher national income. Great emphasis is placed on a three-pronged drive for rapid industrial development, agricultural diversification and a bigger tourist trade. In the main, the plan aims at provision of substantial incentives to investment by way of fiscal reliefs, intensification of promotional efforts by the Development Board and the Tourist Board, the creation of a development finance corporation to channel overseas and local capital into manufacturing industry, the expansion of the facilities for technical education and the establishment of a hotel training school, improvement of the basic communication facilities (airport, roads), the continuation of the housing programme and the encouragement of private investment in housing through mortgage insurance and the promotion of building societies, carrying out of research investigation and the exploration of the commercial feasibility of new productive possibilities, completion of the new general hospital and construction of district hospitals, and provision of increased office accommodation.

Education

Education policy aims at the integration of the primary and secondary systems of education and the eventual introduction of compulsory education for children between the ages of 5 and 14 years.

Education at the primary stage is provided in Government primary schools and in preparatory departments of independent schools. Secondary education is provided in senior departments of primary schools, in Government secondary modern schools, Government secondary grammar schools and some independent schools. No tuition fees are charged in Government primary or secondary schools.

There are 116 primary schools, 5 secondary modern schools and 10 secondary grammar schools which are entirely maintained by Government funds. At the close of the school year 1961-62 the number of children in primary schools was 40,720 (20,731 boys, 19,989 girls), in secondary modern schools 4,742 (2,381 boys, 2,361 girls), in secondary grammar schools 4,390 (2,482 boys, 1,908 girls). Erdiston Training College for teachers provides a one-year emergency residential training course for approximately 100 teachers including 30 from the Windward and Leeward Islands, and from September 1962 there will be a two-year course in addition to this emergency course. Under the Barbados Government Training Programme, the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan and the Commonwealth Bursary Scheme, scholarships and bursaries are awarded annually to teachers in Government schools and other qualified applicants for study in Commonwealth countries and at the University of the West Indies. Codrington College, affiliated to the University of Durham, is a Theological College. There were 25 students in residence during 1961-62.

During the academic year there were 65 Government scholars, exhibitioners and bursars attending universities overseas: 14 in the United Kingdom, 2 in Canada, and 49 at the University of the West Indies. In addition, 26 students were advanced loans from the Higher Education Loan Fund; 6 were attending universities in the United Kingdom, 15 were at the University of the West Indies and 5 at universities in the United States, Canada, India and Germany.

Evening classes in Academic, Commercial and Technical subjects, Handicrafts and Home Economics are conducted at various centres throughout the island, including the Housecraft Centre and the Evening Institute under the Adult Education programme. Technical education is provided at the Technical Institute established in 1955. It offers courses at three levels, for craftsmen, for technicians and for those desirous of proceeding to advanced technological studies. The apprenticeship Board is responsible for the organization of industrial training and 48 bursaries are awarded annually for training in various trades under apprenticeship schemes with master workmen.

Expenditure on education services in 1961-62 was $4,299,564 compared with $1,774,384 in 1951-52 and $475,662 in 1941-42.
Libraries and Museums

A free Public Library (80,781 books) is maintained by Government. The Barbados Museum and Historical Society possesses collections of books, pictures, models, specimens of birds and fishes, and a collection of relics of the original Arawak inhabitants of the island.

Health

The Barbados General Hospital has accommodation for 46 paying patients and 407 non-paying patients. In-patient attendances numbered 10,482, out-patient attendances 156,254 in 1961-62. The Government maintains a mental hospital with accommodation for 321 males and 476 females and a leper hospital at which there are 11 patients. For the training of midwives the Government Maternity Hospital has accommodation for 20 expectant mothers. The new general hospital is still under construction. Each of the 11 parishes has an infirmary for the care of the destitute sick and for the housing of the aged and poor. These infirmaries provide medical care and in some parishes function as district hospitals. A district hospital at Oistins, Christ Church, was opened in December 1960. It provides 20 beds: 10 for maternity and 10 for acute medical cases.

Preventive medicine is based on the Health Centre System. Three centres are operating in St. Michael, St. Peter and St. Philip. Two of these centres operate out-station clinics in various parts of the Island.

Estimated expenditure on Health Services amounted to $2,912,531 in 1961-62 compared with $206,870 in 1935-36.

Communications

An International Airport is situated at Seawell, 12 miles from Bridgetown. Air France, British Overseas Airways Corporation, British West Indian Airways, Linea Aeropostal Venezolana, Pan American World Airways and Trans-Canada Air Lines operate frequent scheduled services connecting Barbados with the major world air routes.

There are 688 miles of road open to traffic most of which has a bituminous surface.

Bridgetown is the only port of entry, although some loading of sugar takes place at Speightstown and oil is pumped ashore at Spring Gardens and an Esso installation on the West Coast.

The main shipping companies visiting Barbados are Harrison Line, Elder and Fyffes Line, Royal Netherlands Steamship Company, Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, Saguenay Shipping Ltd., Booth Line, Lamport and Holt Line, Alcoa Steamship Company, M.A.N.Z. Line, Moore McCormack Line, Nourse Line, Caribbean-Hamburg Line (formerly Three Bays Line) and Federal Shipping Service. Occasionally ships of the Linea "C" and Grimaldi Lines visit port.

Broadcasting

A wired system which is now island-wide, is operated by a local company—Barbados Rediffusion Service Limited. It has 21,380 subscribers.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is engaged in the cultivation of the sugar crop and auxiliary occupations connected with the sugar industry. Approximate figures are: 21,000 persons engaged in agriculture, 14,750 in domestic service, 12,200 in the retail trade and 8,850 in construction work. About 1,600 persons are engaged in the fishing industry.

At the end of 1961 there were six Trade Unions of which 2 were employers' associations with membership totalling about 291 business concerns and three workers' organizations with about 12,000 members.

Main Crops and Products

Sugar cane is the principal export crop grown on all plantations and on nearly all small holdings. In 1962 sugar production was the equivalent of 158,458 long tons.

Yams, sweet potatoes, eddoes, cassava, maize and pigeon peas comprise the main food crops which are grown in accordance with regulations issued annually. Green vegetables and other crops are cultivated on a minor scale and there is a limited production of tree crops and citrus fruit.

The estimated numbers of livestock are as follows:

- Cattle, 11,550; Pigs, 55,000; Sheep, 36,200;
- Goats, 8,650; and Poultry, 100,000.

A Central Livestock Station has been established to investigate the possibility of developing an economic system of animal husbandry, with special attention to dairying.

A Fisheries Section of the Department of Agriculture was established in 1944 for the investigation of more efficient methods of marine fishing and to encourage their use. Large scale mechanisation of the fishing fleet has been practically accomplished with the assistance of loans from Government, and construction of cold storage facilities is expected to be completed in January 1963. The estimated catch of fish during 1961 was 7,004,200 lb valued at approximately $1,400,840.

Production of natural gas during the year ended 31st March 1961 was 87.3 million cubic feet. During 1961, 14,138.85 tons of temper, building and manurial limestone were exported.

Manufactures include the production of sugar for local consumption, rum, bread and a variety of biscuits, edible oil, aerated waters, cigarettes, soap, ice and furniture.
