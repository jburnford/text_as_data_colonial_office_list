Geographical Features

Malta consists of a plateau with a hard core of coralline limestone on the west side which descends by gentle steps to a plain composed of a thick stratum of soft globigerine limestone on the south-east. The highest point on the Island, situated near Dingli, is just over 800 feet above sea level. The Grand Harbour and Marsamxett Harbour are excellent ports of call, while safe anchorages are also provided by Marsaxlokk Bay, St. Paul's Bay and Mellieha Bay. There are no rivers, lakes or forests. In low-lying places the soil, which contains a high percentage of lime and is rich in phosphates, is deep, but elsewhere it is shallow. Cultivation is mainly in terraced fields where the soil is held by rubble walls.

Climate

The climate is healthy. There are no excessive periods of hot or cold weather. The lowest temperature in 1961 was 43·8° F. recorded on the 14th January, while the highest, 94·2° F., occurred on the 10th September. The mean temperature for 1961 was 66·8° F. and the mean annual rainfall was 10·54 inches. The mean annual rainfall at Valletta for the past ten years is 19·11 inches. Rain is rare in June, July and August. In August the heat at sea level approaches that experienced in subtropical countries. The nights, however, are pleasant and cool, except during the prevalence of the scirocco wind which blows from the south-east.

History

From Roman times until 1530 Malta was subjected successively to Arab and Sicilian domination. In 1530, the Emperor Charles V gave the Island to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, who held it until 1798, when Napoleon Bonaparte invested it on his way to Egypt, having prepared the ground by intrigue and revolutionary propaganda. On 12 June 1798 Ferdinand de Hompesch, the last Grand Master in Malta, capitulated without any resistance and the Order was dispersed. The French installed themselves in the islands, but their interference with Maltese laws and customs brought about a sharp reaction, and the Maltese drove the French troops within the fortified towns and, with the help of the British fleet, held them closely blockaded for two years, after which the French, reduced to extremities, surrendered to the British.

In 1800 the Government was placed in the hands of Great Britain. The Treaty of Amiens provided that the islands should be restored to the Knights, but this was prevented by the recommencement of the war. The representatives of the Maltese people, freely elected, unanimously approved a declaration of rights in which, inter alia, they requested the protection of His Majesty the King of Great Britain and Ireland, recognised him as their Sovereign Lord, whilst maintaining that the power to establish the Constitution of the Islands, which His Majesty was bound to keep inviolate, was vested in the General Congress elected by the people.

Malta was a vital point in allied strategy in the Second World War and the Island was subjected to heavy enemy air attacks between the entry of Italy into the war in 1940 and the liberation of North Africa in 1943. In 1942, Malta was awarded the George Cross in recognition of the part she had played in the War.

Constitution

After the war Malta was granted a measure of Self-Government (subject to the reservation of certain powers to the Governor) under a Constitution introduced by Letters Patent dated 5th September 1947. On the resignation of the Government led by Mr. D. Mintoff on the 24th April 1958, the Leader of the Opposition Dr. G. Borg Olivier refused to form a Government without a mandate from the electorate; disturbances followed, a state of emergency was declared on 30th April and the direct administration of the Island was assumed by the Governor. On the 15th April 1959, after abortive talks with Maltese leaders (November-December 1958) the state of emergency was brought to an end, the 1947 Constitution was revoked and replaced by an interim Constitution established by the Malta (Constitution) Order in Council, 1959, and the Malta Royal Instructions, 1959.

Under this Constitution all legislative and administrative powers were vested in the Governor acting, except in certain specified cases, in consultation with the Executive Council. The Executive Council was composed of three ex officio members (Chief Secretary, Legal Secretary, Financial Secretary), three other nominated official members, and four nominated unofficial members.

Following the report of a Constitutional Commission under the chairmanship of Sir Hilary Blood, a new Constitution for Malta was introduced by the Malta (Constitution) Order in Council, 1961, under which the Island is now known as "the State of Malta". The Constitution provides inter alia for the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual; the United Kingdom Government retains responsibility for defence and external affairs (however, in August 1962, the Government of Malta was granted the power to negotiate directly with the "Six" for the eventual association of Malta with
the Common Market and to deal directly with other countries for the purpose of obtaining financial and technical aid). The Governor and Commander-in-Chief is required to consult with the Cabinet composed of a Prime Minister and seven Maltese Ministers, in exercising all his powers, with certain exceptions; a United Kingdom Commissioner is appointed to represent the Government of the United Kingdom in Malta. A Consultative Council is also appointed composed of the Governor as Chairman, the Prime Minister, the United Kingdom Commissioner, three members appointed by a Secretary of State and three members appointed by the Prime Minister, providing for consultation on policy relating to defence and external affairs, and on any matters affecting the relations between the United Kingdom Government and the Government of Malta as may be referred to it by either Government.

Elections for the fifty seats in the Legislative Assembly, as opposed to forty seats under the 1947 Constitution were held on 17th, 18th and 19th February 1962. The state of the parties in the Legislative Assembly now is: Nationalist Party twenty-six seats, Malta Labour Party sixteen seats, Christian Workers Party four seats, Democratic Nationalist Party three seats, Progressive Constitutional Party one seat. The Nationalist Party Leader Dr. Giorgio Borg Olivier, was entrusted with the formation of a Government and the Cabinet was sworn in on the 5th March 1962.

Land Policy

There is no restriction on the alienation of land to non-Maltese but the Mortmain Law restricts the alienation of land to religious bodies or institutions under certain circumstances.

Taxation

The principal forms of taxation are income tax, import duties, excise duties, stamp duties, entertainment duties, tombola duty, licence duties and succession and donation duties.

Income tax, introduced in 1949, is levied on all personal incomes, with certain exceptions, at the following rates:

- 2s. for every £ of the first £200.
- 3s. for every £ of the next £300.
- 4s. 6d. for every £ of the next £400.
- 6s. 6d. for every £ of the remainder.

The tax on companies is at the rate of 5s. on every £ of the chargeable income.

A surtax is also levied on incomes exceeding £2,500 at the following rates:

- 2s. for every £ of the first £500.
- 3s. for every £ of the next £500.
- 4s. for every £ of the next £500.
- 5s. for every £ of the remainder.

wheat trade. The funds of the "Massa Frumentaria" were in 1798 appropriated by the French Government then in occupation of the Island.

Under the Malta Treasury Bills Emergency Ordinance, 1958, the Government may raise up to £1,500,000 by the issue of Treasury Bills. The amount of such bills outstanding on 31st March 1962 was £1,028,000.

The Government is also empowered to raise up to £4,000,000 under the Local Loans (Registered Stock and Securities) Ordinance, 1959. Three issues of Local Development Registered 6% Stock have been made under this Ordinance. The first of £1,300,000 was made at 98½% in December 1959, the second of £1,200,000 at 99½% in October 1960, and the third of £1,670,000 at 95½% in November 1961. All issues were fully subscribed.

Bank of England notes ceased to be legal tender in the Island in 1949. Maltese £5, £1 and 10s. notes are on a par with sterling and £ for £ coverage is maintained at the Bank of England. The amount of local currency in circulation on 31st March 1962 was £23,541,000.

Development Plans

During the financial year ended 31st March 1962, a total of £3,845,009 was spent on development and other capital works.

Since the end of the War, direct aid by way of free grant from Her Majesty's Government to Malta has amounted to over £52 million, mainly in respect of capital expenditure including War Damage and Reconstruction grants.

The Five-Year Development Plan for the Maltese Islands covering the period 1959-64, which was published in October 1959, was reviewed towards the beginning of the third year. The Reviewed Plan was published in July 1961 and provides for an expenditure of over £35½ million of which £29½ million was made available by Her Majesty's Government in loans (£12·48 m.) and grants (£16·77 m.), including £19¼ million from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds. It was also anticipated to secure a long term loan of £2·3 million from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to finance in part the cost of a new power station and distillation plant.

The Plan aims at diversifying the Maltese economy which has hitherto been largely sustained by the expenditure of the fighting Services; this expenditure is bound to decline because of changing defence policies and concepts. The measures contemplated in the Plan to achieve this end may be summarized as follows:

(a) The Harbour, which is Malta's leading natural asset, is to be developed by the conversion of the Dockyard to commercial use and by the construction of modern deep water quays and other port facilities. A £7½ million loan from Colonial Development and Welfare sources is being made for the Dockyard operation which has been entrusted to a United Kingdom firm of ship repairers. The new quays have been completed. The completion date of the few outstanding works is March 1963.

(b) Funds are provided for the building of a fully serviced industrial estate, work on which is now well advanced, and it is expected that some seventeen factories will have been built by March 1963. Capital loans and grants are also offered to industry, in addition to an income tax "holiday" and Customs duties easements available under the Aids to Industries Ordinance. An extensive publicity campaign undertaken by an Aids to Industries Board has drawn the attention of industrialists in the United Kingdom, on the Continent and elsewhere to the wide range of aid offered. The results have been satisfactory and some 25 projects for different industries have been approved. Besides these direct aids, the Plan also sets out to provide the basic services necessary for industrialization apart from the port already referred to above, i.e., the expansion of the water and electricity supplies and the modernization and expansion of the telephone services. Technical Education is also to be developed in order to meet industry's increasing need for skills. The construction of a College of Arts, Science and Technology has started and a grant of £100,000 has been secured from U.N.E.S.C.O. towards furniture and equipment.

(c) The tourist industry is being built up to take advantage of Malta's climatic, scenic and historical assets. The Capital loans and grants to industry referred to above will also be made available for hotels. The extension of essential services to hotel resort sites is being undertaken by the Government and for this purpose just under £1,000,000 is being provided.

(d) The two indigenous industries, agriculture and fisheries, are being assisted towards greater efficiency.

(e) Although the greater share of the funds is allocated to these economic objectives, substantial provision is made for the social services—primary and secondary education, health, housing, sewers and public buildings.

Education

Compulsory education was introduced in 1946. Primary education is carried on principally in free Government schools which are Roman Catholic. There are 112 Primary schools, where Maltese and English are the only languages of instruction and where Italian and French have recently been included in the curriculum, with an enrolment of 51,885 pupils; and six Grammar schools with 3,676 pupils. The Royal University of Malta, founded in 1592 and raised to University status in 1769, has an average attendance of 350 students and grants degrees and diplomas in divinity, law, medicine, architecture, engineering, dental surgery, pharmacy, arts, science and public administration. The number of Maltese studying in United Kingdom Universities or colleges during 1961 was 100. There are 172 evening classes for languages, technical and commercial subjects with an attendance of 3,000 and 179 literacy classes for illiterates and semi-illiterates with an attendance of 857. There are three Secondary Technical Schools providing seven-year courses leading to G.C.E. Ordinary and Advanced level for 1,660 pupils of whom 593 are girls. A Technical Institute is being built to provide three to five year craft and technician courses for 725 pupils between 14 and 17 years. This Institute is to incorporate the various technical schools which are spread over different areas. An apprenticeships school provides five-year courses for 356 apprentices on the day release system. A new College of Arts,
Science and Technology has provided full-time and part-time courses in Engineering at the technician level for 90 students in its first session. St. Patrick’s Residential School has 117 boarders, age 9 to 15. The School of Art provides seven evening classes attended by 185 persons of all ages. 212 persons are undergoing accelerated full-time technical training in various trades, at two Government Industrial Training Centres in Malta and one in Gozo. These centres were started under the vocational training scheme for prospective migrants. There is a Government home for girls with an average total of 54 inmates. The total number of private (primary and secondary) schools is 86 with an attendance of about 18,833 pupils.

In 1961–62 ordinary expenditure on education was £1,885,875; capital expenditure was £504,818. Expenditure on education in 1935 was £149,521.

Communications

The international airport of Malta is Luqa Airfield, which is also a Royal Air Force Station. There are other Service airfields at Hal Far and Ta’ Qali. British European Airways operate the following scheduled services:—(a) Twelve services a week to London. These call at Palermo or Naples or Alghero or at Rome; (b) three services a week to Catania; and (c) five services a week to Benghazi via Tripoli.

During 1961, 2,635 aircraft offloaded 53,165 passengers and picked up 55,503 others. 33,892 passengers passed through Malta in transit.

The size of Malta does not provide scope for internal air services and the only railway line ceased to operate in 1931.

Twelve miles of roads have been resurfaced with hot-laid bitumen macadam. Surfacing for main roads remains penetration macadam (semi-grouting) and 479 miles are paved in this method using limestone aggregate and bituminous emulsion; 190 miles of country and estate roads are paved in water-bound macadam.

The number and tonnage of ships which entered the Grand Harbour during 1961 are:

- 2,032 Steamships, tonnage 3,853,803.
- 140 Sailing ships, tonnage 8,994.

There is no regular passenger line between Malta and the United Kingdom. The Italian Tirrenia Line runs a regular passenger service between Malta and the Continent calling at Syracuse, Catania and Naples. (Frequency: (1) July-September every three days; (2) October-June every 5 days.)

Broadcasting

Under the Broadcasting Ordinance, 1961, broadcasting services in Malta were made the responsibility of the Malta Broadcasting Authority, established on 29th September 1961. The Authority has entered into agreements with Rediffusion (Malta) Limited granting an extension of their existing licence to provide a wired sound service up to 1986, and with the Malta Television Service Limited (a new company constituted in Malta and within the Rediffusion group of Companies) to provide Television and Wireless Sound Services for a similar period. In the case of Wireless Sound, the company has been allowed a period of five years within which to decide whether or not to take up this concession: if it has not done so by then the concession will lapse.

Local television transmissions were inaugurated on 29th September 1962. The service is in English and Maltese and operates on the 625 line standard. In addition, Italian Television transmissions can be received.

Television sets number 18,500 with another 9,800 licences for wireless receiving sets; as on 31st July 1962 the subscribers to Rediffusion’s wired sound service numbered 46,000.
