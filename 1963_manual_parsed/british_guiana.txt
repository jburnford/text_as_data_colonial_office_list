BRITISH GUIANA

Area

British Guiana lies on the north-east coast of the South American Continent. Its area is 83,000 square miles, divided into three counties as follows:

| County     | Square miles |
|------------|--------------|
| Essequibo  | 61,660       |
| Berbice    | 16,920       |
| Demerara   | 4,420        |

Population

At 31st December 1961 the population was 590,140. The estimates for the racial groups were:

| Race                  | Population |
|-----------------------|------------|
| East Indians          | 289,790    |
| African descent       | 192,660    |
| Mixed descent (Coloured) | 68,420    |
| Portuguese            | 7,390      |
| Europeans other than Portuguese | 4,760 |
| Chinese               | 3,520      |
| Amerindians           | 23,600     |

Principal Towns

The City of Georgetown, Demerara, is the capital and with its environs has a population of approximately 150,000. Population in the city proper numbers about 74,000. New Amsterdam, Berbice, has a population of 14,300 approximately.

Geographical Features

The Colony may be divided into three zones, viz., the low-lying coastland, the mountain region and the intermediate region. The coastland comprises a low-lying, swampy strip of marine alluvium which varies in width from about ten miles in the west to about 40 miles in the east. Its flat, grassy savannahs would mostly be inundated during the rainy season but for artificial drainage and sea defences. Almost the whole of the population and agricultural activity of the Colony is concentrated between the Pomeroon River and Corentyne River along this strip. The mountain region, known as the Pakaraima Range, lies along the western boundary of the Colony. Mount Roraima, a plateau 22 square miles in extent and over 9,000 feet above sea level, is the highest elevation. The intermediate region, the largest area of the Colony, lies mainly to the east and south. It is almost entirely forest clad. The total area under forest is approximately 70,000 square miles.

There are many large rivers which with their numerous tributaries form a vast network of waterways. All the large rivers are impeded above the tideway by rapids, cataracts and falls. Kaieteur, one of the largest single-drop waterfalls in the world, is situated on the Potaro River. It is nearly five times the height of Niagara and has a vertical drop of 741 feet with a further 80 feet of rapids and falls. Its width varies from 350 to 400 feet.

Climate

The climate is pleasant for the greater part of the year; it is hot only in the summer months. The mean temperature is 80°F. with a daily range of about 18°F. on the coast and a slightly wider range inland. There are two wet and two dry seasons in the coastal regions—the long wet season usually from April to August and the long dry season from September to mid-November. This is followed by wet weather until the end of January, and the short dry season until April. The mean annual rainfall is 93 inches, but there are wide variations in the rainfall over the region, ranging from 80 to 100 inches along the coast and falling as low as 60 inches in the savannahs of the interior where the dry season is October to February and the wet season May to August. The nights are uniformly cool.

Slight earth tremors are felt occasionally, but no damage is caused.

History

There have been some discrepancies in dates and other matters in the various historical accounts but the following brief statement is based upon what is taken to be the most authentic version.
In history there are really five Guianas—Spanish Guiana (now Venezuela), Portuguese Guiana (now Brazil), Dutch Guiana (now Surinam), French Guiana and British Guiana. A navigable river was so important to the Europeans who first visited the coastline between the Amazon and the Orinoco that they gave the Amerindian name of the river to the surrounding countryside. Thus the three counties of British Guiana are Essequibo, Demerara and Berbice, and the areas known as Rupununi, Mazaruni, Potaro, Cuyuni, Pomeroon and Corentyne take their names from the rivers that flow through them. Guiana is an Amerindian word meaning "Land of Waters."

The coastline of the country between the Amazon and Orinoco was first traced by Spanish sailors in 1499 and 1500 and the first European settlements were almost certainly Spanish or Portuguese. The Dutch established a settlement on the Pomeroon in 1581 but were evicted by Spanish and Indians (probably in 1596) and retired to Kyk-over-al up the Essequibo. In 1627 Dutch merchants settled on the Berbice. The Dutch West Indian Company, formed in 1621, controlled these settlements.

The first English attempt at settlement in the area lasted from 1604-06, on the Oyapock River (now French Guiana). Fresh ventures in 1609 and 1629 failed to establish a permanent settlement. Lord Willoughby, famous in the early history of Barbados, founded a settlement in Surinam in 1651 but this was captured by the Dutch in 1667. In October of the same year it was recaptured by a British expedition from Barbados, the leaders being unaware of the signing of the Treaty of Breda in the previous July. It was mid-1668 before the Dutch finally obtained possession of Surinam in accordance with the terms of that Treaty. In effect Surinam was exchanged for New York, though this was not explicit in the terms of the Treaty.

The Dutch retained their hold on the territory with more or less firmness, now yielding to England and now to France or Portugal, until 1796 when during the war of the French Revolution it was captured by a British fleet from Barbados. The territory was restored to the Dutch in 1802, but in the following year retaken by Great Britain and finally ceded to her in 1814, exclusive of Surinam.

**Constitution**

A new and advanced form of Constitution with universal adult suffrage at the age of 21, a two Chamber Legislature and a ministerial system, based on the recommendations of the Constitutional Commission of 1950–51, was brought into effect in 1953 by an Order of the Queen in Council dated 1st April 1953 made under the British Guiana Act, 1928, and a General Election was held on the 27th April. Late in 1953 Her Majesty's Government concluded that it was necessary to suspend the advanced constitution introduced earlier in the same year; the circumstances in which the suspension occurred are dealt with in the Report of the British Guiana Constitutional Commission, 1954 (Cmnd. 9274).

A Constitutional Commission was appointed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies under the Chairmanship of Sir James Robertson, G.C.V.O., G.C.M.G., K.B.E., with Sir Donald Jackson, then Chief Justice of the Windward and Leeward Islands, and Mr. George Woodcock, C.B.E., Assistant General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, as members. Its terms of reference were: "In the light of the circumstances which made it necessary to suspend the Constitution of British Guiana to consider and to recommend what changes are required in it."

The Commission's report was published on the 2nd November 1954 and Her Majesty's Government announced their acceptance of its recommendation for a period of "marking time" in the advance towards self-government. In the meantime the affairs of the Colony continued to be administered in accordance with the British Guiana (Constitution) (Temporary Provisions) Order in Council dated 22nd December 1953. This provided for an Executive Council of three *ex officio* Members and not more than seven Nominated Members; and a Legislative Council of a Speaker, the same three *ex officio* Members and not more than 24 Nominated Members.

Constitutional changes were introduced by the British Guiana (Constitution) (Temporary Provisions) (Amendment) Order in Council, 1956, dated 19th December 1956 providing for a Legislative Council of not more than 28 Members (excluding the Speaker) comprising three *ex officio* Members, not less than 14 Elected Members and not more than 11 Nominated Members. At the first elections held under the amended constitution in August 1957 the number of Elected Members was 14, and six other Members were nominated by the Governor. Five members of the majority party in the Legislative Council were nominated by the Governor to serve on the Executive Council with the three *ex officio* Members. The Governor charged all Members of the Executive Council with responsibility for departments and subjects, Members other than the *ex officio* Members being styled Ministers.

As a result of a resolution passed by the Legislative Council in June 1958, a Constitutional Conference was convened in London in March 1960. Following the decisions of this Conference, the British Guiana (Constitution) Order in Council, 1961 was passed, providing for a new constitution giving full internal self-government to British Guiana.

The new constitution, which came into effect on 18th July 1961, provided for a bi-cameral legislature—a Legislative Assembly of 35 members, elected by universal adult suffrage, and a nominated Senate of 13 members, eight appointed on the advice of the Premier, three after consultation with such persons as can speak for the differing political views of opposition groups in the Assembly, and two by the Governor in his discretion. The life of the Legislature will be four years unless dissolved before this time. The Legislative Assembly is presided over by a Speaker, who may or may not be a Member of the Assembly. The Senate is presided over by a President, chosen by Members from amongst their own number. The Senate has delaying powers only.

The Executive body, called the Council of Ministers, is presided over by the Premier, and consists of not more than nine other Ministers. The Premier is the member of the Legislative Assembly who, in the judgment of the Governor, is best able to command the confidence of a majority of the members of that Chamber. At least one and not more than three members of the Council must be members of the Senate. The Council of Ministers is responsible to the Legislative Assembly.
The Governor must exercise all his powers in accordance with the advice of the Council of Ministers except where otherwise expressly stated (the notable exceptions are in respect of defence and external affairs).

A Bill of Rights incorporated in the Constitution enumerates in detail rights to equality, personal freedom and property and provides for their enforcement by the Supreme Court.

The Constitution also provides for the establishment of Judicial, Public and Police Service Commissions, which will ultimately have executive responsibility for appointments, discipline and dismissals in the Services for which they are responsible. Judges of the Supreme Court may be removed only for inability or misconduct and then only by the Governor on the advice of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which itself can be approached only on the recommendations of a locally appointed Judicial tribunal.

The first elections under the new Constitution were held on 21st August 1961, following which the Governor appointed as Premier the leader of the People's Progressive Party (Dr. Cheddi Jagan) which obtained the majority of seats (twenty) in the Legislative Assembly. Nine other Ministers were appointed and their portfolios allocated on the advice of the Premier. Of these, six have now been drawn from the Legislative Assembly and three from the Senate. Three Members of the Assembly have also been appointed as Parliamentary Secretaries. In accordance with the Constitution, Ministers have been assigned responsibility for all internal matters except criminal proceedings, the audit of public accounts and the public service. External affairs (except external trade) and defence remain under the control of Her Majesty's Government.

Arising out of a resolution passed by the British Guiana Legislature in October 1961, Her Majesty's Government announced in January 1962 its willingness to hold a Constitutional Conference in London in May 1962 to discuss the date and the arrangements to be made for the achievement of independence by British Guiana. The Conference was held in October, having been delayed to await the report of the Commission of Inquiry on the Disturbances which took place in Georgetown in February. Delegates from each of the three political parties represented in the Legislative Assembly attended the Conference. As no agreement could be reached on the terms of a Constitution for Independence, the Conference was adjourned to allow for further discussions between the parties in British Guiana.

**Land Policy**

Land in the Colony falls within three categories—

(i) Freehold: (a) alienated by the Dutch prior to 1803; (b) alienated by the Crown;

(ii) Crown land—about 90% of the area of the Colony;

(iii) Colony land, acquired from private owners and the Crown for public purposes.

Crown land may be alienated or leased to any individual with the consent of the Governor on the advice of the Minister of Natural Resources; in the case of Colony land with the consent of the Council of Ministers. Absentee lessees must have a legal representative in the Colony. Alienation of Crown Land is restricted to leases for periods not exceeding 99 years.

**Taxation**

The main heads of taxation are Customs, excise and licences, income tax, stamp duties, estate duties, acreage tax, duty on transport and mortgages.

Income tax rates range from 6 cents (for the first $1,200 (£250)) to 70 cents on each $ of chargeable income in the case of individuals. Companies, other than Mutual Life Insurance companies, pay 45%; Mutual Life Insurance companies 25%.

**Public Finance**

| Year | Revenue* | Expenditure* |
|------|----------|--------------|
| 1957 | £9,532,044 | £8,962,620 |
| 1958 | £10,203,012 | £9,659,018 |
| 1959 | £10,141,591 | £9,492,683 |
| 1960 | £11,686,403 | £10,477,961 |
| 1961 | £12,569,692 | £11,877,700 |

*Total Colony revenue and expenditure.

In 1961, £3,957,075 in revenue came from Income Tax while Customs and Excise produced £6,167,150. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

- Social Services: £3,662,070
- Administration including:
  - Law and Order: £2,817,516
- Public Works: £1,223,729
- Economic Development: £1,131,000

The Public Debt at the end of 1961 was £22,259,751.

**Currency**

The currency in circulation is (1) the unified currency notes and coins issued by the Currency Board of the British Caribbean Territories (Eastern Group) brought into circulation on 1st August 1951 and 15th November 1955 respectively. Currency notes are of denominations $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 and $100; coin 50 cents, 25 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents, 2 cents and 1 cent.; (2) note circulation of the two Joint Stock Banks, Barclays Bank (D.C.O.) and Royal Bank of Canada, being gradually withdrawn; (3) United Kingdom silver and copper coins and local silver coins (4d.) being gradually withdrawn. The currency is exchangeable with sterling at par. The West Indian $ has a fixed equivalent value of 4s. 2d., that is $4·80 to £.

**Development Plans**

A Two-year Development Programme, 1954–55, was launched early in 1954. Expenditure fell short of the estimate of $44 million but public investment over the period stimulated economic activity throughout the Colony. The unexpended balances from the Two-year Programme were incorporated into a Five-year Development Programme for the period 1955 to 1960.

That Programme was designed mainly to improve and extend basic developmental facilities, e.g., drainage and irrigation, roads, internal transport services and telecommunications; to provide for the establishment of comprehensive schemes of rural electrification and land settlement and for an improvement and expansion of social services, in the fields of health, housing and education. It was financed partly from Colony...
funds, derived from loans and accumulated surplus revenue balances, and partly from Colonial Development and Welfare grants. Expenditure on development projects was as follows:

| Year | Expenditure |
|------|-------------|
| 1961 | $21,659,752 |
| 1960 | $15,772,569 |
| 1959 | $18,757,678 |
| 1958 | $19,877,000 |
| 1957 | $18,310,000 |

Arising from recommendations made by the International Bank Mission after their visit to the Colony in 1953, for the planning and execution of the Development Programme, a Credit Corporation was established to administer credits for the encouragement and development of agriculture, industry, forestry, fisheries, rural and urban housing. The total amount loaned up to the end of June 1961 was $22.8 million; repayments totalled $16.9 million.

Regional Development Committees and Area Sub-Committees have been established in each of the twelve administrative districts to assist in general development activities, especially to promote aided self-help schemes and to advise the Credit Corporation on applications for loans.

An Industrial Development Committee was set up in 1957.

Technical assistance in many fields of development work is being provided by the United States Agency for International Development (formerly the International Co-operation Administration) whose personnel stationed in the Colony include a Director of Operations and administrative staff, and who have provided Specialists in Housing, Community Development, Geology, Agriculture, Land Settlement, Drainage and Irrigation, Road Construction, Health and Industrial Development.

A Five-year Development Programme for the period 1960-64 is now in progress. Expenditure of $110.5 million is planned, of which $91.8 million is allocated for economic and $18.7 million for social development.

Other Development

Development is also being undertaken by the Colonial Development Corporation. The Corporation has acquired concessions for the large-scale development of timber in the area known as the Bartica Triangle, and has completed a new mill at Houston at a cost of over £600,000. The Corporation has also furnished capital on medium- and short-term loan for the Rice Development Company.

Education

About 80% of the population is literate. There are 340 primary schools (Government-owned or aided) with 129,373 pupils. Secondary schools cater for 7,220 students; these include three Government-owned schools—Queen’s College for boys, Bishops’ High School for girls and Anna Regina Secondary (Co-educational) with a total enrolment of about 1,378 students—12 aided schools with a total enrolment of 5,842 students. There are also 24 privately run schools. The Carnegie School of Home Economics provides day and evening courses in various domestic crafts and the Technical Institute trains industrial apprentices and provides evening classes. The number of students from British Guiana studying in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland at 1st January 1961 was 802, those studying in Canada numbered 50 and those in the U.S.A., 147. There were 92 undergraduates enrolled at the University of the West Indies in Jamaica. In 1961 the total recurrent expenditure on Education was £1,685,788. In 1938 expenditure was £94,290.

Health

The principal diseases are filariasis, enteric fever, tuberculosis, helminthiasis and nutritional deficiency (especially vitamin B complex). Preventive measures provided by Government consist of a Sanitary Department with headquarters in Georgetown and branches in each district working under a Public Health Ordinance; Medical Officers of Health for each county; a School Medical Service; a Maternity and Child Welfare League with a Lady Medical Officer of Health; a Mosquito Control Service. Health Centres, erected with funds provided under a Colonial Development and Welfare Grant, have been completed and put into operation in 31 country districts. The object is to combine curative and preventive services at these centres.

There were in 1961, five general Government Hospitals with 1,207 beds; five private general hospitals with a total of 288 beds; 10 cottage hospitals with 176 beds; one Tuberculosis Sanatorium with 262 beds; one Leprosy Hospital with 405 beds and one Mental Hospital with 834 beds.

In 1938 Government expenditure on Medical Services was £126,025; in 1961, £1,370,930.

Communications

Atkinson Field is the only airport but there are a number of airstrips. Internal services are operated by British Guiana Airways. British Guiana Airways Limited are also the agents of British West Indian Airways Limited who operate services between British Guiana and other parts of the Caribbean; other external services are provided by Pan American Airways, the K.L.M. Royal Dutch Airlines, Air France and Cruzeiro-do-Sul (Brazil).

There are two Government-owned railway lines (single track), both parallel to the coast about 80 miles in length. Passengers carried in 1961 totalled 3,822,412 and freight totalled 75,593 tons.

There were in 1961, 125 miles of roads with bituminous surface, 406 miles of burnt earth and other roads and in addition 400 miles of trails.

The chief ports are Georgetown, New Amsterdam and Springlands, with a sub-port at Morawhanna, and at Kaituma.

The number and tonnage of vessels which were entered and cleared from the principal ports during 1961 were as follows:

| Entered | Cleared |
|---------|---------|
| No.     | Tons    | No.     | Tons    |
| Georgetown | 1,269   | 1,994,224 | 1,247   | 1,973,935 |
| New Amsterdam | 194   | 262,114   | 144     | 254,707   |
| Kaituma   | 75      | 115,480   | 75      | 115,480   |

British Guiana is in direct communication with the United Kingdom, France, Holland, Canada, U.S.A., the West Indies, Surinam and French Guiana. Services are provided for passengers and cargo principally by Booker Lines, Harrison Lines, Royal Netherlands Steamship Company, Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, Alcoa, and Saguenay Terminals.
The three main rivers, Demerara, Essequibo, and Berbice, are navigable by ocean-going vessels of moderate draught for about 60, 35 and 100 miles respectively. There are also numerous other rivers which are navigable in their tidal reaches by smaller vessels. There are very many long stretches of water in the upper rivers navigable by launches. Ferry services, coastal and river services are also operated by steamers.

Broadcasting

The commercial broadcasting station, Radio Demerara, operates on short and medium waves with a power of 10,000 watts medium wave, and 2,000 watts short wave; another station—the British Guiana Broadcasting Service—which was officially opened in December 1958 operates a 10 kW transmitter on 560 kc/s (536 metres). There were 42,237 licensed holders of radio receiving sets in 1961.

Principal Occupations

The greater part of the population is engaged in agriculture. Estimates of average employment for the following industries are:—Sugar planting 15,159; Sugar milling 4,075; Bauxite 3,325; Rice milling 429; Sawmilling 831.

At the end of 1961 there were 41 registered workers’ organizations and 7 employers’ associations.

The Main Crops and Products are sugar, rum, molasses, rice, coconuts, bauxite, timber, gold and diamonds. In 1961 production was:

- Sugar . . . . . . . . . . . 325,000 tons
- Rum . . . . . . . . . . . 2,791,000 proof gals.
- Rice (milled) . . . . . . . 128,000 tons

- Gold . . . . . . . . . . . 2,000 bullion ozs.
- Diamonds . . . . . . . . . 113,000 metric carats

Timber production (principally greenheart, mora and crabwood) in 1961 was approximately 10·2 million cubic feet.

The estimated livestock population is: cattle 180,000; pigs 20,000; sheep 40,000; goats 10,000; horses, mules and donkeys 9,000; poultry 706,800.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

An independent Marketing Board is responsible for the sale of rice. This Board financed the purchase by rice farmers of tractors, combines, ploughs, etc. A hire service of mechanical equipment to farmers has been operated by Government mills and land settlement authorities.

Investigations into mechanized cultivation and the agronomic problems involved are carried out on the Mahacony-Ahary Rice Development Scheme.
At 31st December 1961 there were 566 primary co-operative societies with 40,251 members and savings of £302,103.
