KENYA

Area
The Colony and Protectorate of Kenya is bisected by the equator and extends approximately from latitude 4° N. to latitude 4° S. and from longitude 34° E. to 41° E.

The total area is 224,960 square miles (including 5,171 square miles of water).

Population
The first provisional summary results of the census held in August 1962 show that the total population of Kenya is now 8·676 million persons. No analyses by race or tribe were available at the time of going to press. However, the numerical importance of some main tribes of the Colony and Protectorate (based on the 1948 census) is as follows:

| Tribe                  | Per cent. |
|------------------------|-----------|
| Kikuyu                 | 19·5      |
| Luo                    | 14·4      |
| Bantu                  | 12·5      |
| Kamba                  | 11·7      |
| Meru                   | 6·2       |
| Mijikenda (or Nyika)   | 5·6       |

The total non-African population in mid-1961 has been estimated at 289,000.

Geographical Features
Physically, Kenya may be divided into four areas. The north-east is an arid, thorn-bush-covered plain (below 2,000 feet) with a small, nomadic population; the south-east is similar but practically uninhabited except along the banks of the Tana River and in the coastal strip and the Taita Hills (7,000 feet) where rainfall is adequate; the north-west is also generally low and arid but includes Lake Rudolf (160 miles long) and many mountains (e.g. Nyiru 9,200 feet). The south-west quarter, in which 85% of the population and practically all the economic production is concentrated, comprises a plateau rising to 10,000 feet and supporting the mountains Kenya (17,058 feet), Elgon (14,178) and the Aberdare Range (13,104). Much of the area between 7,000 and 11,000 feet is forest (5,000 square miles). The plateau is bisected from north to south by a part of the Great Rift Valley, 30-40 miles wide and 2,000-3,000 feet below the plateau on either side. The Rift floor rises from 1,280 feet at Lake Rudolf to 7,000 feet near Naivasha and falls again to 2,000 feet at Lake Natron. West of the Rift the plateau falls to Lake Victoria (3,720 feet) and eastward the Tana (500 miles) and Athi Rivers flow to the Indian Ocean.

Principal Towns and Port
Mombasa is the centre of the coastal strip and the principal port in East Africa.

History
The eastern and north-eastern boundaries of Kenya were originally defined along the Juba River by an agreement with Italy (1891) but upon the cession of Jubaland to Italy in 1925, a commission was appointed to adjust these boundaries. The northern boundary is defined by an agreement with Ethiopia in 1947 which will supersede the original agreement of 1907, when the demarcated frontier is ratified.

The Protectorate is a strip of land extending ten sea miles inland along the coast from Tanganyika to Kipini and the islands of the Lamu Archipelago and consists of the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar, in respect of which an annuity of £16,000 per annum is paid to His Highness. The original concession was made in 1887 to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the administration of the territory was transferred in 1895 to Her Majesty's Government and the whole Protectorate was placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. It was transferred in 1905 from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. By Orders in Council of 1906 the Protectorate was placed under a Governor and Commander-in-Chief and executive and legislative councils were constituted. The frontiers were defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891) and by Order in Council in 1926. All foreign consular jurisdiction was, during the year 1908, transferred to the British court.

By the Kenya Annexation Order in Council, 1920, the territories outside the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar were established as a Colony; the Sultan's mainland dominions are now styled the Protectorate of Kenya, whilst the remaining territory is known as the Colony of Kenya.

Constitution
Following the Kenya Constitutional Conference in London early in 1962, new constitutional provisions were agreed upon. These included the setting up of a National Coalition Government supported by the two main national parties: The Kenya African National Union and the Kenya...
African Democratic Union. The Council of Ministers, under the chairmanship of the Governor, is the chief instrument of Government.

The Council of Ministers consists of 16 Ministers of whom two are civil servants. There are 14 unofficial Ministers of whom 11 are Africans, two Europeans and one Asian. The Deputy Governor is also a member of the Council of Ministers. There are also Parliamentary Secretaries appointed by the Governor whose duties and functions are to assist Ministers in the exercise of their duties.

The Legislative Council, as a result of the General Election in February 1961, consists of 53 Constituency or directly Elected Members and 12 National Members selected by the Constituency Members. Four more members in special categories bring the total members of Legislative Council up to 70 with the Speaker.

A Council of State designed to protect any community against harmful discriminatory legislation consists of a chairman and not more than 16 and not less than 10 members.

The "Framework" constitution for Kenya, which was agreed by almost all delegates at the Lancaster House conference in London early in 1962, provides for the maximum decentralisation of the powers of government to "effective authorities capable of a life and significance of their own, entrenched in the constitution and drawing their power and being from the constitution and not from the Central Government". It also provides for a strong and effective Central Government responsible to the Central Parliament and for an impartial and independent judiciary and a Bill of Rights guaranteeing the proper protection of individuals which should be enforceable in the courts.

As soon as possible after the details of the constitution have been settled and the necessary instruments for an internal self-government constitution have been made, a general election will be held and that constitution introduced.

Six Municipalities are established under the Municipalities Ordinance, 1928: the City of Nairobi, the Municipal Councils of Eldoret, Mombasa, Nakuru and Kisumu and the Municipal Board of Kitale. All these municipalities now have elected as well as nominated members, the elected members being elected on the basis of Communal Rolls. Three municipalities, Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu now have an African chairman. Seven County Councils are established under the County Councils Ordinance, 1952; Nairobi, Nakuru, Naivasha, Aberdare, Nyanza, Kitale and Uasin Gishu. There are elected and nominated members, the former being elected on Communal Rolls. Thirty-three African District Councils are established under the African District Councils Ordinance, 1950 and they exercise powers and functions similar to those of other local authorities. There are both elected and nominated members and the electors are the ratepayers, i.e. generally excluding women. Eighteen of the Councils now have an African Chairman; the remainder continue to have the District Commissioner as Chairman.

Second-tier local authorities have been established in the areas of County Councils, where they are known as Urban or Rural District Councils and in the areas of African District Councils, where they are known as Locational Councils. In a few Townships, Township Accounts are kept, and the Township Committee operates on Local Government principles but without corporate status.

Following the approval of Sessional Paper No. 2 of 1961 by the Legislative Council, consideration is being given to amending the law relating to local government. The new law will, in broad terms: (a) provide one legislative framework for all types of local authority; (b) provide for new constitutions for all local authorities; (c) alter the franchise for local government elections and replace communal electoral rolls by common rolls; (d) provide the framework within which African District Councils can progress to the status of County Councils; (e) establish some of the Township Authorities as Township Boards which will be corporate bodies and provide for the inclusion of others within the areas of existing local authorities.

Land Policy

All land in Kenya is either Crown Land, Trust Land or Private Land. Crown Land includes all leasehold land in the Colony outside the boundaries of the Special Areas, unalienated land and the various Special Reserves and Settlement Areas created for the enjoyment and benefit of certain tribes. All unalienated Crown Land, whether within a municipality or a township, may be alienated to persons of any race, but in townships and municipalities, the terms of the leases are still restricted to 99 years.

Agricultural land is now granted for an initial term corresponding to that required for development and upon observance and performance of the covenants and conditions a freehold grant may issue upon payment. Where agricultural land has been purchased for settlement schemes for smallholders and assisted owners, a freehold grant is made under the Land Registration (Special Areas) Ordinance, 1959. Control in dealings in land in the Scheduled Areas is still exercised by the twelve Divisional Boards which dealt with a total of four hundred transactions by the end of 1961. Some forty-five applications for conversion of leasehold to freehold were made under the Conversion of Leases Regulations, 1961, thirty-seven of which had been approved by the close of the year and payment had been made in twenty-four cases.

The Special Areas (Trust Land) are established under the Kenya (Land) Order in Council, 1960, and are vested in the Trust Land Board. The rights and interests of the inhabitants under customary law are preserved by the Order in Council and the land is administered under the Trust Land Ordinance (Cap. 100, Revised Laws of Kenya). Wherever the concept of individual ownership of land in the Special Areas has emerged all rights and interests under customary law are recognised, registered and later administered under the Land Registration (Special Areas) Ordinance, 1959, whereupon the land ceases to vest in the Trust Land Board or to be administered under the Trust Land Ordinance, and, except for inheritance, customary law is superseded by the provisions of the Land Registration (Special Areas) Ordinance and the ordinary land laws of the Colony. Individual title has already been registered over 1,080,000 acres in the Central and Rift Valley Provinces. Control over transactions in registered land is exercised under the Land Control (Special Areas) Regulations, 1961.

Private land includes all land held in fee simple under either the Land Titles Ordinance, the Crown Lands Ordinance or the Land Registration (Special Areas) Ordinance, 1959.
To give effect to Government's proposals for the administration and tenure of all land, the Kenya (Land) Order in Council, 1960 was brought into effect on the 7th December 1960, except Part IV which has the effect of constituting a multi-racial Central Land Advisory Board to advise the Governor on policy respecting land generally in Kenya. The Highlands Board has been abolished but the Trust Land Board is retained. The Order in Council prohibits the creation of racial restrictions on the ownership or occupation of land and by powers therein contained the Governor has made the Land Control Regulations, 1961, the Development of Land Use (Planning) Regulations, 1961, and the Conversion of Leases Regulations, 1960, which govern the general development, control and use of all land and enable certain Crown lessees to convert their tenure to freehold. In order to carry this into effect, twelve Divisional Land Control Boards have been constituted, as have four Regional Land Control Boards which, except in certain circumstances where due to delay they can assume the powers of the Divisional Land Control Board, act as appellate Boards. An Appeal Board will shortly be appointed to hear in turn appeals from the Regional Land Control Boards. The Central Authority set up under the Land Control Regulations, 1961, controls subdivisions of both agricultural and non-agricultural lands outside townships and municipalities but for the time being its jurisdiction is restricted to the Declared Areas, and in respect of non-agricultural subdivisions the districts of Kilifi and Kwale, but it has no jurisdiction at present over Trust or "Special" lands. However, to control ribbon development, its jurisdiction extends to a 400 ft. width on either side of certain trunk and major roads throughout the Colony whether they fall within the Special Areas or not.

**Taxation**

The forms of direct taxation which apply to all communities are income tax and personal tax. The maximum rate of personal tax in 1961 was Shs. 200/-. Under the Income Tax Acts generous personal allowances are given. The rate of tax for resident individuals commences at Shs. 2/- in the £ on the first £400 of chargeable income and increases gradually to a maximum rate of Shs. 15/- in the £ where the chargeable income exceeds £9,000. Persons other than individuals, which includes companies, are liable at Shs. 5/50 in the £. In addition, Undistributed Income Tax at Shs. 9/50 in the £ is payable by certain companies and Corporation Tax at Shs. 2/- in the £ by other companies. A graduated hospital tax calculated on total income is also payable by all Europeans and Asians.

**Currency**

The currency in circulation is an East African currency issued and controlled by the East African Currency Board whose headquarters are in Kenya, on behalf of the four East African Territories—Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar—and also Aden. The standard coin is the East African shilling (cupro-nickel) with subsidiary coinage of the following denominations: 50 cents (cupro-nickel) and 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent (bronze). The note issue consists of notes of the following denominations: Shs. 10,000/-.
Shs. 1,000/-, Shs. 100/-, Shs. 20/-, Shs. 10/-, Shs. 5/- (Shs. 200/-, and Shs. 1/- notes previously issued are gradually being withdrawn from circulation and are no longer issued). The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

Development Plans

Under the ten-year Development Programme, 1946–55, £38·8 million was allocated, of which £27·4 million was spent over the eight years 1946–53. Of this expenditure 45% was financed from loans, 24% from Colony revenue and 18% from various appropriated funds.

A new Development Programme covered the three and a half years, 1954–57, during which £21·7 million was spent, mainly from loan moneys. Other development expenditure outside the three-and-a-half-year programme amounted to £13·8 million during the same planning period, making a total of £35·5 million in all.

Total expenditure under the 1957–60 Development Programme, which embraced all important development projects, amounted to £27·6 million. Expenditure currently envisaged under the 1960–63 Development Programme amounts to £35·7 million.

Education (1961)

Europeans: 45 primary schools (21 Government, 1 local government, 11 aided, 12 unaided) with altogether 8,213 pupils, 14 secondary schools (2 Government, 9 aided, 3 unaided) with altogether 3,069 pupils.

Asian including Goan and mixed races: 123 primary schools (30 Government, 90 aided and 3 unaided) with altogether 41,226 pupils, 36 secondary schools (13 Government, 11 aided and 12 unaided) with altogether 11,507 pupils, 3 Government teacher-training centres with altogether 308 students.

African: 4,311 primary schools (8 Government, 4,024 aided and 279 unaided) with altogether 661,855 pupils, 1,235 intermediate schools (5 Government, 1,201 aided, 29 unaided) with altogether 155,903 pupils, 53 secondary schools (50 aided, 3 unaided) with altogether 6,422 pupils, 42 teacher-training centres (41 aided and 1 unaided) with altogether 3,897 students.

Arab: 11 primary schools (8 Government and 3 aided) with altogether 3,251 pupils, 1 aided secondary school with 311 pupils. In addition, 60 Arab pupils were studying in Asian schools; 71 boys and 13 girls were also studying in Asian primary schools.

Higher Education

During the year 1961, there were 399 students from Kenya (including 31 Asians, 1 European and 1 Arab) studying at Makerere College in Uganda.

The Royal Technical College of East Africa was opened in Nairobi in April 1956. There are Faculties of Architecture, Arts, Science, Engineering, Veterinary Science and Commerce and a Department of Domestic Science. In 1961 there were 202 Kenya students studying at the College consisting of 14 Europeans, 92 Asians and 96 Africans. 5 Kenya students were admitted in 1961 to the Law Faculty of the newly established University College, Dar-es-Salaam.

The Royal Technical College gained University College status in the 1961–62 academic year and will become one of the constituent colleges of the projected University of East Africa.

Many Kenya students are given assistance to take courses of higher education in institutions overseas as well as in Makerere College and the Royal College, Nairobi. Government provides bursaries for all races and additional scholarships are made available from funds allocated under Colonial Development and Welfare schemes. There are also a few scholarships limited to candidates from specific schools. African District Councils award bursaries, mainly for local education, but also in a few cases for study overseas. In addition there are scholarships available for teachers to enable them to take degree and other courses in the United Kingdom and to qualify for responsible teaching posts. Among other sources of funds to assist students going overseas, are scholarships offered by the Governments of America, India, Pakistan, Ethiopia and Ghana, open to Africans and Arabs, and awards made on the recommendation of a Committee for study and training in the United States of America, which are open to all races.

In addition to these awards a new scheme has been started to assist in the higher education of Government servants which provides "Kenya Development Scholarships", open to Kenya Government servants of all races recommended by the Heads of their Departments, to pursue courses which will either improve their capacity as Government servants or fit them for promotion.

An Educational Trust has been formed by a private donor called the Maniben and Mohamedali Rattansi Educational Trust. In the terms of the Trust the income is divided into five equal parts for awards annually to Europeans, Africans, Muslims, non-Muslims and Ismailis. Awards are made from this Trust to students of all races for studies in the United Kingdom, India and elsewhere.

The total number of Kenya students taking courses of higher education in the United Kingdom during 1961 was 1,307. This number included 166 Africans (69 with bursaries, scholarships or loans), 847 Asians and Goans (152 with bursaries, scholarships or loans), 14 Arabs (9 with bursaries, scholarships or loans) and 280 Europeans (89 with bursaries, scholarships or loans).

Technical and Trade Schools

Five Technical and Trade Schools were administered by the Education Department in 1961 and plans for the building of a sixth school costing
£52,250 at Eldoret were approved. The schools situated at Kabete near Nairobi, Thika in the Central Province, Sigalgala in Nyanza Province, at Kwale in the Coast Province and at Machakos had a total student population of 1,228 in 1960 and 1,222 in 1961.

The Educational standard for admission to the schools is a pass at Kenya Preliminary Examination level taken at the end of the intermediate school course and competition for the number of places available is very keen.

The syllabus for Technical and Trade Schools was revised in 1961 and students may now take the Government Grade III Trade Test on completion of two years training. A selected few may continue for a third year of training and take the Grade II Trade Test following which they are able to opt for a fourth year of training. Students must complete a year in industry after the fourth year before taking the Grade I Trade Test.

Some 313 students completed their training in 1961 most of whom were placed in employment.

Building projects in the African Schools Development Programme to a total value of £120,000 were carried out by Building Teams and trainees at various institutions at Nairobi, Kikuyu, Shimo-la-Tewa, Kanguru, Kiganjo, Kakamega, Butere and Kisumu.

Secondary Technical Course

Students complete a one year selective Grade course before sitting the examination for entry to the secondary technical course leading to the General Certificate of Education Examination at Ordinary Level; 32 students sat the G.C.E. examination at the end of 1960 and of these 30 passed in one or more subjects and four were accepted for training at Royal College.

Kenya Polytechnic

A wide range of courses were available at the Kenya Polytechnic during 1961; these included Full time, Day Release and Part-time courses in Engineering (Electrical and Mechanical) and Building at Elementary, Junior and Senior levels, Telecommunications, Science, Professional Accountancy, Banking, Secretarial work and Domestic Science. Some 800 students attended the courses, many of whom were sponsored by Government Departments.

Courses for Laboratory Technicians, Road Surveyors and Shorthand Typists will be available, as will facilities for courses leading to the General Certificate of Education at Advanced Level.

Mombasa Institute of Muslim Education

A total of 181 students took the City and Guilds course in mechanical and electrical engineering and 163 students took the secondary technical course leading to the General Certificate of Education at "O" Level during 1961. The Evening Classes provided by the Institute were well attended, 53 students were enrolled for the Technical Engineering course, 19 for the Motor Mechanics course and 34 for the Electrical Installation course.

Evening Continuation Classes

Classes were held at Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru and Kisumu and the total enrolment of 1,790 showed a slight increase over the numbers enrolled during 1960. A wide variety of subjects were offered such as English at elementary and secondary level, Swahili, mathematics, bookkeeping and shorthand, motor car maintenance and radio engineering.

Finance

The recurrent expenditure on Technical and Vocational Education for the year 1960-61 was £432,600 including a Government contribution of £155,000 to the Royal College and £59,000 to the Mombasa Institute of Muslim Education.

Government expenditure on education in 1961-62 was:

| Gross expenditure | 7,760,532 |
|------------------|-----------|
| Net expenditure  | 6,526,924 |
| Appropriations-in-aid | 1,233,608 |

Libraries and Museums

Government assists financially the McMillan Memorial Library, which caters for all races, in addition to the Desai Memorial Library, also in Nairobi, and the Seif bin Salim Public Library in Mombasa. In Nairobi the British Council and the United States Information Service maintain lending libraries and reading rooms open to the public. There is a large collection of reference books on natural sciences in the Coryndon Memorial Museum in Nairobi.

The East African Literature Bureau organizes lending libraries throughout Kenya and publishes books in English, Swahili and other Kenya languages.

The Coryndon Memorial Museum, Nairobi, is a general natural history museum and also has an important section dealing with prehistory. It ranks as one of the leading museums on the African continent. The Acting Curator, R. H. Carcasson, is assisted by a staff of six Europeans and seventeen Africans.

The Snake Park was opened to the public at the beginning of 1960. It is administered by the Museum Trustees of Kenya and directed by C. S. Webb assisted by a staff of three Africans.

Fort Jesus, Mombasa's three centuries old Portuguese monument, was opened to the public as a museum in 1960. It contains archaeological and historical specimens from the former fortress and from other parts of the African Coast.

At Olorgasailie, situated 40 miles along the Nairobi-Magadi Road, a series of roofed-over excavations and a field museum illustrate human and animal life in Kenya about one hundred and fifty thousand years ago. Simple rest camp accommodation is available. The site is administered by the Coryndon Memorial Museum.

Health

The principal causes of mortality are general infectious and parasitic diseases, respiratory diseases, alimentary, allergic, metabolic and blood diseases. No disease reached epidemic proportions in 1961. There was a decrease in the notification of tuberculosis and poliomyelitis in the Colony generally, but a slight increase in the occurrence of trypanosomiasis in Nyanza Province. Drought, followed by army worm, and serious floods, brought their problems of malnutrition, which were most seriously felt in Turkana, Kajiado and Tana River districts and where they were dealt with by a famine relief programme.
In 1961 beds in Government hospitals totalled 7,094 (non-government hospital beds totalled 3,944). In-patients in Government hospitals totalled 149,025 and out-patients 1,176,432.

Total expenditure of the Medical Department in the financial year ending 30th June 1961 was £2,161,045, together with Development expenditure of £262,874.

Communications

East African Airways Corporation operates in Kenya to Mombasa, Kisumu, Eldoret, Kitale and Malindi as well as connecting services to the neighbouring territories of Uganda, Tanganyika and Zanzibar. A number of charter aircraft-operating companies are based at Wilson Airport.

All scheduled international and internal services are operated from Nairobi airport at Embakasi whilst Wilson Airport is retained for smaller charter operations and club flying. Eastleigh Airport is now used by the Royal Air Force mainly as a maintenance base and both their transit and locally based aircraft normally operate from Embakasi.

Air Traffic Control and Telecommunications Services are provided by the Directorate of Civil Aviation, East Africa, and meteorological services by the East African Meteorological Department. Air services operating into East Africa are licensed by the Civil Aviation Board which comprises representatives of the East Africa Territorial Governments and the East African Common Services Organization, with a secretariat provided by the Directorate of Civil Aviation.

International services connect Kenya direct with the United Kingdom, Europe, India, South Africa, the Congo, Aden and Madagascar.

In mid-1962 there were approximately 26,000 miles of grant-earning roads; only about 925 are bitumen surfaced. The main roads 3,748 miles, where not bitumenized, are gravel-surfaced and, for the most part, all-weather except during excessive rains. Secondary roads (6,530 miles of which 258 are bitumenized) are mostly gravel-surfaced, but are more subject to closure to heavy traffic in wet weather. A £4-million Contractor-Finance Scheme for the bitumenization of trunk roads which started in 1959 is progressing satisfactorily (160 miles have been bitumenized). It is expected to complete this scheme by mid-1963. A £1-million International Bank Loan Scheme for the improvement of roads in African Areas of high agricultural potential, which started in 1960, should be completed in 1963.

Broadcasting

Kenya was the first British Colonial Territory to have a regular public wireless broadcasting service. Until 1st October 1959 there were three broadcasting organizations in Nairobi:

(i) Messrs. Cable and Wireless Limited provided services in the English and Asian languages under a Charter granted to them in 1931. This Charter expired in September 1956 but by an agreement between the Company and the Government Cable and Wireless continued to provide these services.

(ii) The Kenya Government through its Department of Information operated a service for African listeners in Swahili and many vernacular languages. It was known as the African Broadcasting Service and broadcasts from stations at Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu and Nyeri.

(iii) The Forces Broadcasting Station has been operating since 1944 a service for British troops stationed within the Colony.

In 1954 the Kenya Government appointed a Commission, three of whose four members were B.B.C. officials, to make recommendations on the development of broadcasting in Kenya. The Government has drawn up its plans for the future of broadcasting in Kenya on the basis of the Commission's Report and these plans have now been largely implemented with the establishment in 1958 of a Department of Broadcasting, known as the Kenya Broadcasting Service, which took over all the African Services from 1st July 1959 and the English and Asian Services from Cable and Wireless, Ltd., from 1st October 1959 which again was succeeded by Kenya Broadcasting Corporation on 1st June 1962.

The Kenya Broadcasting Corporation provides the following separate services:

(i) General Service, broadcasting in English from Nairobi for 91 hours per week, on both short and medium wave VHF/FM;

(ii) Asian Service, broadcasting in six Asian languages from Nairobi for 68 hours per week, on short and medium wave;

(iii) African, Konkani and English Service, broadcasting in Swahili and English, from Nairobi for 67½ hours per week, on short and medium wave;

(iv) Nairobi Regional Service, broadcasting in Kimvita, Somali, Kikamba, Kikuyu, Kimeru, Masai and Swahili from Nairobi, for 32 hours per week;

(v) West Regional Station, broadcasting in Luo, Kisii, Kalenjin, Luhya, Swahili and English, from Kisumu, for 62 hours per week on short and medium wave;

(vi) Coast Regional Station, broadcasting in Swahili and Arabic from Mombasa, for 58 hours per week, on medium wave only.

The Kenya Broadcasting Corporation also has a Commercial Service in which advertisements and sponsored programmes are broadcast in all languages.

In the General Service a period of 11½ hrs. per week is at present used for this Service, 8½ hrs. per week for the Asian Service and 11 hrs. per week for the African Service. On the 22nd September 1961, a Bill was prepared making provision for the establishment of the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation to take the place of the Kenya Broadcasting Service. This Bill is to cover future broadcasting and television in Kenya. All the undertaking assets and liabilities of the Kenya Broadcasting Service are to be vested in the Corporation on a date to be fixed by the Governor.

The K.B.C. Television Service was inaugurated on the 1st October 1962.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population of Kenya are occupied in peasant cultivation; a lesser number are pastoralists. Minorities are engaged in seafaring and fishing at the coast and on the Victoria and
Rudolf Lakes. The numbers reported in employment in other occupations in 1961 are shown in the following table:

| Industry                                      | Africans | Asians | Europeans |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing             | 249,764  | 628    | 1,634     |
| Mining and Quarrying                          | 3,546    | 145    | 69        |
| Manufacturing and Repairs                      | 35,553   | 4,911  | 2,054     |
| Building and Construction                     | 15,292   | 2,138  | 467       |
| Electric Light, Power and Water Supply         | 1,838    | 341    | 294       |

| Transport and Communications                   | 11,157   | 2,239  | 1,118     |
| Domestic Service                               | 22,463   | 108    | 49        |
| Public Services (including Railways)           | 145,533  | 12,220 | 8,881     |
| Other Services                                 | 18,015   | 2,480  | 3,272     |
| All Industries and Services                    | 529,386  | 37,821 | 22,184    |

In December 1961, 51 employees' and 17 employers' unions were registered under Trade Union legislation. The total paid-up membership of employees' unions, as shown on the 1961 returns, is 107,302. The membership claimed is considerably higher than that figure.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops and products are coffee, tea, sisal, pyrethrum, meat, butter, ghee and cheese, hides and skins, maize, wheat and cotton.

The forests of the Highlands provide the bulk of the Colony's timber supplies—softwoods such as Podocarpus and East African pencil cedar and various hardwoods, of which East African olive and East African camphor are those in greatest demand. Forest produce from the established plantations of exotic soft woods is becoming available in increasing quantities and supplied 25% of the total sales of logs from the Forest Estate during 1961. There has been a decline in the internal demand for timber which has caused a severe recession in the timber trade but there are signs that there may be substantial increases in the export of Kenya timbers overseas.

The estimated figures for production of fish from Fisheries during 1961 amounted to 13,000 tons of fish valued at £640,000 obtained from the Coast, Lake Victoria, and other lakes, rivers, ponds and dams. At the Fish Culture Farm, Sagana Station, covering 40 acres of ponds, the fisheries research effort of Kenya is directed to problems mainly concerned with tilapia and other fresh water fish.

The scheme of loans to fishermen at Malindi during 1961 was working satisfactorily and increased the catch of fish by approximately 100 tons valued to fishermen at Sh. 89,000/-.

In 1961 the chief minerals in order of value were soda ash, copper, salt, refined gold, limestone (other than for cement), diatomite, carbon dioxide (natural). The total value of minerals won during 1961 was about £5,300,000.

There are in operation in the Colony over 130 main types of manufacturing and industrial concerns which produce goods both for internal consumption and export. There has been a steady rise in the export of Kenya's products, which, over the past five years, have increased by more than 30% in value to £35 million in 1961. The main items of export in 1961 were coffee, sisal, tea, pyrethrum, meat and meat preparations, hides and skins and soda ash. Two cement factories, in addition to supplying home requirements, exported more than 93,000 tons during 1961, about 120% more than during 1960.

(Including bullion and specie, excluding all interterritorial transfers of domestic produce to Uganda and Tanganyika.)

In 1961, 34·4% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 13·4% from other Commonwealth countries and 47·3% from foreign countries; postal packages and special transactions accounted for 4·9%.

In 1961, 24·1% of domestic exports went to the United Kingdom, 16·6% to other Commonwealth countries, and 58·7% to foreign countries; 0·6% exported as ships' and aircraft stores.

Tourist Trade

Kenya's share of the East African income from tourism in 1961 is estimated at approximately £3,730,000 and so it ranks as the country's second largest "export". Figures for visitor arrivals are available only in respect of East Africa as a whole and not for each of the constituent territories, though it is possible to determine what proportion of the average length of stay of visitors is spent in each country. In 1961 there were 57,085 visitors to East Africa who spent, on the average, 67% of their time in Kenya. Their average duration of stay was 16½ days.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

On 31st December 1961 there were 650 registered co-operative societies, with a total membership of 201,000. Of these, 586 were marketing societies, mostly African, but also including Asian and country-wide racial societies. Organizations previously looked upon as basically European have been accepting members of all races. The value of the produce handled by marketing societies in 1961 was £20,150,000, which was £1,050,000 less than the previous year due to the adverse climatic conditions encountered during the year.

On top of marketing societies the co-operative field extended to cover consumers, housing, thrift and savings societies.
