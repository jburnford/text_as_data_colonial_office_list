THE HIGH COMMISSION TERRITORIES

(BASUTOLAND, THE BECHUANALAND PROTECTORATE AND SWAZILAND)

Basutoland (a Colony), the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland (also a Protectorate), are administered on behalf of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom by a High Commissioner. Each territory is administered on his behalf by a Resident Commissioner, responsible to the High Commissioner, and is divided into administrative districts in charge of District Commissioners. Since the advent of the South African Republic in May 1961 the High Commissioner has also held the office of British Ambassador to South Africa.

BASUTOLAND

Area

Comprises an area of 11,716 square miles of which about one quarter in the west is lowland country varying in height above sea level from 5,000 to 6,000 feet, the remaining three quarters being highlands rising to a height of 11,425 feet in the Drakensberg Range, which forms the eastern boundary with Natal.
Population

In 1956 (the date of the last census) the population figures for Maseru township were: Africans 5,739, Europeans 590, Mixed Race 57 and one Asian.

A census of all races held in April 1956 gave the following figures for the population present in the Territory: Africans 638,857; Europeans 1,926; Persons of Mixed Race 644; and Asians 247. The census also gave the additional figures of 154,782 as an estimate of the number of Africans temporarily absent from the Colony for work and other purposes. The estimated total population of Basutoland in July 1961 was 697,000 with an additional 130,000 absent from the Territory. (By way of comparison, a census of 1875 gave a total of 469 Europeans and 127,707 Africans in Basutoland.)

Principal Towns

The capital is Maseru, which has an estimated population of about 10,000. The other principal towns are: Butha Buthe, Leribe, Mafeteng, Mokhotlong, Qachas Nek, Mohale's Hoek and Quthing.

Geographical Features

The Colony of Basutoland is an enclave within the Republic of South Africa, its boundaries running with those of Natal to the east, the Cape Province to the south and the Orange Free State to the north and west. It lies between latitudes 28° 35' and 30° 40' south and longitudes 27° 00' and 29° 30' east. The mountain ranges run from north to south and those in the central area, named the Maluti, are spurs of the main Drakensberg which they join in the north, forming a high plateau varying in height from 9,000 to 10,500 feet. In this area two of the largest rivers in the Republic, the Orange and the Tugela, and tributaries of the Caledon, have their source.

Climate

Rainfall is variable and averages approximately 29 inches a year over the greater part of the country. Most of it falls between October and April, but there is normally no month which has less than half an inch. Unfortunately, river discharge statistics show that most of this water is lost to Basutoland in the form of run-off. The deciding factors from an agricultural point of view are whether the rain comes in steady soaking showers at intervals suited to the growth of the staple crops or whether it comes in the form of short and heavy storms, running to waste and eroding the soil. Serious droughts, like the one of 1948-49 are rare and there are a large number of perennial streams, though not so many as existed some years ago. In the lowlands the temperatures vary from a maximum of 90° or more in summer to a minimum that rarely drops below 20° in winter; in the highlands the range is much wider and temperatures below zero are common.

History

The Basotho as a nation did not come into prominence until 1818 when Moseshoe, a minor chief of the Bakoena tribe in Northern Basutoland, gathered together the remnants of the various clans that had been scattered by the raids of the Zulu and Matebele.

The new nation went through a period of struggle, first with the emigrant Boers of the Great Trek, then with the British. From 1856 until 1868 there was a series of wars with the Orange Free State burghers, Moshoeshoe lost a large portion of his country and repeatedly sought the protection of the British Government.

In 1868 the Basotho became British subjects and the boundaries of the Territory were defined by the Cape of Good Hope Notice of 13th May 1870.

The country remained in a very unsettled condition until it was annexed to the Cape Colony in 1871. The people never took kindly to the Cape Colonial rule and in 1880, after various disturbances, the Governor of the Cape extended to Basutoland the provisions of the Cape Peace Preservation Act of 1878, which included a clause for the general disarmament of the Basotho. They refused to accept the terms, and, after a war lasting nearly a year, the Act was repealed, several chiefs would not submit, and it was decided to hand over the administration to the Imperial Government. This was effected by Order in Council of 2nd February 1884.

Constitution

Before the introduction of constitutional reforms in March 1960 Basutoland was governed under a loose-knit system by which the British Administration combined with an hereditary Chieftainship. The Basotho owe allegiance to a single Paramount Chief under whom there is a hierarchy of Chiefs and Headmen. These Chiefs and Headmen are the authorities with whom the ordinary people deal in their daily affairs, and are responsible for the day to day administration of the Territory.

The Head of the Administration is the Resident Commissioner, who works under the direction of the High Commissioner for Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland.

In 1910 an advisory body known as the Basutoland Council consisting of the Resident Commissioner as President, the Paramount Chief as Chief Councillor and 99 Basotho nominated members, was constituted by Proclamation. The Council evolved gradually and an elected element, 42 in number, was introduced in 1957.

In 1943 District Councils, consisting in the main of nominated members and a small number of elected members, were established as advisory and consultative bodies.

In September 1955 the Basutoland National Council passed a motion requesting "that the Basutoland Council be given power to make laws in all internal matters, such laws to be confirmed by the Paramount Chief". In May 1956 the Secretary of State invited the Council to submit detailed recommendations for an advance in constitutional status. Agreement on a new constitution was reached at the end of 1958 and this was brought into operation in March 1960.

The new constitution provides for an Executive Council, which is advisory to both the High Commissioner and the Paramount Chief, and a Legislative Council known as the Basutoland National Council.

The Executive Council consists of the Resident Commissioner, who acts as Chairman, the Government Secretary, Finance Secretary, Assistant Attorney-General, three persons chosen by the Basutoland National Council from among their own number and one person nominated by the Paramount Chief.

The Basutoland National Council consists of 80 members, divided equally between elected and non-elected members; the former being elected from among the members of District Councils by
the District Councils sitting as electoral colleges for that purpose. The non-elected element is made up of the three official members of the Executive Council (excluding the Chairman), the Commissioner for Local Government, the 22 Principal and Ward Chiefs and 14 nominees of the Paramount Chief. The Council has power to legislate for all persons in Basutoland in respect of all matters, save the following, which are the High Commissioner's matters:

- External Affairs and Defence; Internal Security;
- Currency, Public Loans, Customs and Excise;
- Copyright, Patents, Trade Marks and Designs;
- Posts (including Post Office Savings Bank), Telegrams, Telephones, Broadcasting and Television; the recruitment, appointment, conditions of service, promotion, discipline and retirement (including pensions) of officers in the Public Service.

In respect of legislation within the High Commissioner's field, the Basutoland National Council will continue to act as a consultative body and all matters will be referred to it.

National elections under the new constitution were held in January 1960 to elect the 162 members of the nine District Councils. The results were:

- Basutoland Congress Party . . . 72
- Independents . . . . . 52
- Basutoland National Party . . . 22
- Marema-Tlou . . . . . 16
- Basutoland Progressive Association 0

Taxation

The main forms of direct taxation are Basuto tax, income tax and poll tax (payable by all male adult persons who do not pay Basuto tax).

The principal sources of indirect revenue are customs and excise duties at varying rates. Basutoland is in a customs union with the Republic of South Africa and receives a fixed percentage of the gross revenue collected on imports into the Republic. Licensing exists for many trades and businesses. There are also death duties, stamp duty and a wool and mohair export duty.

Public Finance

| Year    | Revenue   | Expenditure |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| 1958–59 | £1,637,792 | £1,792,336 |
| 1959–60 | £1,803,900 | £2,139,302 |
| 1960–61 | £1,865,866 | £2,393,928 |
| 1961–62 | £1,999,551 | £3,204,052 |
| 1962–63 | £1,828,500 | £3,269,332 |

Excluding Colonial Development and Welfare funds.

Revenue is derived mainly under the following headings for which estimated receipts are given for 1962–63:

- Customs and Excise . . . . . £984,000
- Taxes and duties . . . . . £481,000
- Posts and telegraphs . . . . . £99,120

As revenue was expected to be substantially below expenditure and the Territory had no central balance the United Kingdom Government approved grant-in-aid of £1,441,000 for 1962–63.

Currency

The currency is the same as in the Republic of South Africa. During February 1961 the Territory followed the South African change from Sterling to a decimalized system of Rands and Cents (£1 Sterling = R.2; 1 shilling = 10 cents).

Development Plans

Under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act 1959 Basutoland received an allocation of £1·2m. in grants and exchequer loans towards development over the period 1959–64. The programme provides for both social and economic projects, the main headings being:

- Soil conservation and agriculture . . . . . £400,000
- Medical services . . . . . £143,000
- Education . . . . . £119,000
- Roads and airfields . . . . . £104,000
- Water and electricity supplies . . . . . £95,000

A further allocation of £418,000 was made in 1961 for development to March 1963. This will be used principally towards Education, Medical, Agriculture and Veterinary services.

Education

African education is largely in the hands of three missions (Paris Evangelical, Roman Catholic and Anglican), under the direction of the Education Department. Grants-in-aid are paid by Government to the three missions to cover the salaries of all teachers on the approved grant-in-aid list. In many aided schools of the Roman Catholic mission, assistance is given by unaided teachers, particularly Sisters. Small grants are paid from territorial funds to improve the equipment in primary schools. The total expenditure on grants-in-aid during 1960 was £290,099.

There are 1,110 schools and institutions in the Territory, of which all but 14 are under mission control; and of these mission schools 942 are either wholly or partly aided. The total enrolment in primary schools is 136,111. The average number of pupils per teacher is 54. In secondary schools the enrolment is 1,836; in teacher training schools 536; in technical schools 188; and in housecraft or craft schools 506.

The only institution providing post-secondary education in the Territory is the Pope Pius XII College at Roma, which is aided by a small Government grant. In 1960 it had an enrolment of 131 male and 36 female students. The college provides courses leading to the B.A. and B.Sc. and B.Comm. degrees and to the University Education Diploma of the University of South Africa.

All primary education is free and bursaries are provided for all stages of secondary, teacher training and University work. One Mosotho was studying at the University College of Fort Hare in 1960. Six bursars, including one woman, were undergoing medical training at the Durban Medical School. Twenty Basotho were studying at Universities and other institutions in the United Kingdom. One was studying in Southern Rhodesia, three at American universities and three in India. An increasing number of Basotho are being appointed to responsible posts in the Education Department; three Education Officers, three Assistant Education Officers and a Female Education Officer are now Basotho.

Health

The Government Medical staff of the Territory consists of a Director of Health, 20 Medical Officers, one Medical Officer of Health and one Assistant Medical Officer, one Medical Officer for Mental Health and one Surgical Specialist.
There are nine Government hospitals, staffed by European Nursing Sisters with subordinate African staff. There is accommodation for 587 patients in the Government hospitals. A 200 bed Government hospital in Maseru, which with the gracious consent of Her Majesty has been named the Queen Elizabeth II Hospital, was officially opened on the 25th July 1957. There are four mission hospitals subsidized by the Government, with a total accommodation of 338 beds. Health centres in mountain dispensaries provide outpatient medical facilities, and, where a trained African nurse is a member of the staff, maternity services to people living in remote areas. During 1960 17,795 patients were admitted to Government hospitals and 5,351 to mission hospitals. During the period 1937 to 1960 the outpatients at both Government and Mission dispensaries and clinics increased from 110,807 to 604,490. The Leper Settlement, four miles out of Maseru, had 318 patients at the end of 1960.

The principal diseases are venereal disease, chronic rheumatism, malnutrition, infections of the respiratory tract and dyspepsia. The heaviest toll of lives in children is due to tuberculosis, malnutrition, diphtheria, whooping-cough and gastro-enteritis. The incidence of nutritional and deficiency diseases is comparatively high and is allied to maize being the staple food. Typhus, plague and smallpox occur only rarely, and then in sporadic form, while diphtheria, typhoid fever, measles and whooping cough are endemic.

Communications

The Territory is linked with the railway system of the Republic of South Africa by a short branch-line from Maseru, the capital, to Marseilles on the Bloemfontein-Natal main line. One mile of this line is in Basutoland. The South African Railway runs near the boundaries of the Territory and goods are transported by road to the nearest railway station across the border.

The Road Motor Transport Department of the South African Railways runs regular services between Foursburg and Buthe-Buthe, Zastron and Quthing, Zastron and Mohale's Hoek, and Quthing and Sebapala, and within the Territory in the lowland areas there are a number of bus services owned and operated by Basotho.

The greater part of Basutoland is very mountainous and in this area all transport is by pack animals. A new mountain motor road running eastwards from Maseru into the mountains has been constructed in order to open up the interior and facilitate its development and administration. The road has reached a point 80 miles from Maseru.

On the western side of Basutoland a fairly good road system has been developed in the strip of agricultural country running from north to south. The main roads traverse the whole of this area, with branches leading west to the principal points of exit. From the main roads a number of feeder-roads lead towards the foothills.

Principal Occupations

Basutoland is a pastoral country without factories or industrial undertakings, and since the produce of the land is insufficient to support the total population, many able-bodied Basotho leave the Territory each year to take up employment in the Republic of South Africa. The Government protects labourers by forbidding recruitment for any mine or other concern where the conditions of work are not good. All labourers recruited by agents in Basutoland for work outside the Territory have to be attested before an official and the contract must be according to Government Regulations.

Main Crops and Products

So far there has been little evidence of any exploitable mineral deposits in the Territory, but recent prospecting for diamonds has shown encouraging results. For the present, agriculture and animal husbandry are Basutoland's main sources of wealth. The chief exports at present are wheat, wool and mohair. It is estimated that 1,000,000 acres are under cultivation.

The soils in the mountain areas are of basaltic origin, while those in the lowlands are derived mainly from underlying cave sandstone. In the lowlands the soil has been cropped continuously for upwards of 80 years. Due to the absence of fuel, practically all cattle manure is burnt, so that little or no organic matter is returned to the land. Thus with increasing population, both human and livestock, excessive demands have been made on the soil, which has lost its structure and become subject to serious erosion. The soils in the mountains which have been brought into cultivation comparatively recently are rich though shallow. Controlled grazing has brought back a grass cover and has effectively halted the loss of soil by storm water run off in the mountain areas. In 1960 some 1,249,000 trees were planted as part of soil conservation measures.

In 1960 there were 331,200 head of cattle and 1,037,300 sheep in the Territory. Wool, followed by mohair, hides and skins, continue to be the main source of cash income from the animal population.

Trade

Basutoland has no industries and imports the consumer goods and capital items it needs as well as a certain amount of agricultural produce and livestock. Exports consist almost entirely of agricultural commodities and livestock, the main exports being wool and mohair, followed by wheat, sorghum and cattle. The value of imports usually exceeds the value of exports but the adverse balance is partly offset by the export of labour to the Republic of South Africa.

THE BECHUANALAND PROTECTORATE

Area

The Protectorate has not been surveyed as a whole, but its area is estimated at 222,000 square miles. The headquarters of the Protectorate Administration is at Mafeking, across the border in the Cape Province of the Republic of South Africa.

Population

The last census was taken in 1956 and showed a population of 3,177 Europeans, 680 Coloured, 249 Asians and 316,578 Africans.

The population is not evenly distributed, the bulk of the people living in the eastern part of the Protectorate with one fairly large tribe occupying the north-western corner. The central, western and southern areas of the territory, consisting for the most part of the Kalahari Desert, are extremely sparsely inhabited.

The Bechuanas tribes tend to live in large villages or towns. About one-half of the population lives in towns of more than 1,000 inhabitants.

Principal Towns

Francistown, Gaberones, Kanye, Lobatsi, Maun, Molepolole, Mochudi and Serowe.

Geographical Features

The Bechuanaland Protectorate is bounded on the south by the Province of the Cape of Good Hope, on the south-east by the Transvaal, on the north-east by Southern Rhodesia, on the north by the Caprivi Zipfel and on the west by South West Africa. It lies between latitudes 18° and 37° south and longitudes 20° and 29° 50' east. The Kalahari Desert extends over most of the Protectorate west and south of Ngamiland as far as latitude 27°S. This is not a desert in the commonly accepted sense of the word, but consists of a vast expanse of undulating sand-belts with outcrops of limestone. In these limestone belts water is sometimes found at depths from 30 to 100 feet and it is possible that under the deep overburden of sand there may exist untapped reservoirs. The northern and south-western corners of the Kalahari have the least vegetation and most sand dunes, but elsewhere the grasses are excellent, and this is the natural habitat of the aboriginal Bushmen. Large areas are wooded like parklands with camel-thorn and other indigenous trees.

In the north-western part of the Protectorate the Okavango River, flowing inland from Angola, widens into a delta from which flood-waters, in seasons of heavy rainfall, flow as far south-east as the Makarikari salt-lake and south and southwest into Lake Ngami. The Chobe River, also
flowing from Angola, inundates a large area in the north before flowing into the Zambesi 60 miles west of the Victoria Falls.

The mean altitude of the Protectorate is 3,000 feet and in the eastern portion occasional elevations, e.g. at Kanye, Serowe and Ghanzi, reach 4,000 to 5,000 feet.

The Protectorate as a whole is a natural game-reserve for most species of the fauna of Africa and Government policy aims at their preservation.

Climate

The climate is sub-tropical (latitude 22°S. passes through the centre of the Protectorate) but varies with latitude and altitude.

The average annual rainfall is 18 inches, varying from 25 inches in the north to 9 inches or less in the western Kalahari.

In the higher parts, days are pleasantly warm and the nights cold during the winter, but the summer is universally hot. In August seasonal winds blow from the west coast and, desiccated by the Kalahari, carry sand and dust across the whole country.

The atmosphere throughout the year is very dry and this helps somewhat to mitigate the high temperature.

History

In 1884 the British Government appointed a Deputy Commissioner to the Bechuana tribes and in 1885 the whole of the Bechuanaland was, with the concurrence of Khama and other principal chiefs, proclaimed to be under the protection of Her Majesty The Queen. The southern part of the territory, which included Mafeking, Vryburg and Kuruman, was at the same time constituted a Crown Colony with the title British Bechuanaland. In 1885 British Bechuanaland was annexed to Cape Colony, subsequently the Cape Province of the Republic of South Africa. The northern part, known as the Bechuanaland Protectorate, has continued to be administered by the Government of the United Kingdom.

The administration of the Bechuanaland Protectorate is governed by various Orders in Council and Proclamations, of which the most important is the Order in Council of Her Majesty Queen Victoria dated 9th May 1891. That Order empowered the then High Commissioner for South Africa to exercise on Her Majesty's behalf all the powers and jurisdiction which Her Majesty had or might have within the Protectorate and to that end authorized him to take or cause to be taken all such measures as he might think expedient, subject to such instructions as he might from time to time receive from Her Majesty or through a Secretary of State. Other provisions of the Order empowered the High Commissioner to appoint administrative and judicial officers and to assign their functions to them subject to the preservation of his own powers in their entirety and to provide, by proclamation from time to time, for the administration of justice, the raising of revenue and the peace, order and good government of all persons within the Protectorate, including the prohibition and punishment of acts tending to disturb the public peace.

In issuing these proclamations the High Commissioner was instructed by the Order in Council to respect any Native laws and customs by which the civil relations of any Native chiefs, tribes or population under Her Majesty's protection were at that time (viz., in May 1891) regulated, except in so far as the same might be incompatible with the due exercise of Her Majesty's power and jurisdiction or which were repugnant to humanity.

The Order required the High Commissioner to publish his proclamations in the Gazette and reserved to Her Majesty the right to disallow any such proclamation. The Order also provided that, subject to any proclamation lawfully issued by the High Commissioner, any jurisdiction exercisable otherwise than under this Order in Council of 1891, whether by virtue of any Statute or Order in Council, or of any treaty, or otherwise, should remain in full force.

Her Majesty reserved the power to revoke, alter, add to or amend this Order at any time.

Constitution

The Protectorate is administered by a Resident Commissioner under the direction of the High Commissioner for Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland and is divided for administrative purposes into ten districts under District Commissioners who are assisted in the maintenance of law and order by a force of police.

The territory comprises Crown lands, blocks of European farms and tribal Reserves.

In the African areas the method of administration is that generally known as "indirect rule". Tribal administrations were formally established and the powers and rights of African authorities were defined in the African Administration and African Courts Proclamations of 1943 (Caps. 56 and 5 of the Laws, Cap. 56 having now been replaced by Proc. No. 24 of 1956) which replace the original Proclamations 74 and 75 of 1934. In 1938 Tribal Treasuries were successfully established in all Tribal Territories. Government pays 50% of each Tribal Administration's collection of native tax to the tribal treasury concerned; other sources of revenue are a graded tax and stand-rents. The Chiefs and Finance Committees, under the guidance of District Commissioners, are responsible for the preparation of estimates and general management of their treasuries.

On 28th July 1960 the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations announced his approval of proposals for a new constitution in the Protectorate. These proposals were promulgated by the Bechuanaland Protectorate (Constitution) Order in Council, 1960, and provide for a Legislative Council with power to legislate for the Protectorate, subject to certain reserve powers remaining with the High Commissioner. The Legislative Council has an elected unofficial majority; there are 21 elected members, of whom 10 are European, 10 African and one Asian; there are also 10 Government officials and four nominated unofficial members. The European elected members are elected by European voters, subject to certain qualifications of age, residence and property or income; the Asian elected member is elected by Asian voters similarly qualified. The African elected members are elected by an African Council consisting of Chiefs of the eight principal tribes, 32 members elected by the tribal or district councils together with the official and appointed members. The Executive Council consists of six officials and four unofficials two of whom are European and two African.

Taxation

The main forms of direct taxation are African tax and African graded tax, income tax, personal tax and cattle export tax. The principal sources
of indirect taxation are customs and excise duties at varying rates. The Bechuanaland Protectorate is in a customs union with the Republic of South Africa and receives a fixed percentage of the gross revenue collected on all imports into the Republic. Licensing exists for many trades, businesses and professions. There are also death duties.

(a) Revised Estimate  
(b) Estimate

Excluding Colonial Development and Welfare Funds.

Revenue is derived mainly under the following headings for which estimated receipts are given for 1962–63:

- Customs and Excise: £351,865
- Taxes and duties: £640,480
- Posts and telegraphs: £179,050
- Revenue from Government property: £186,150

United Kingdom grant-in-aid was £560,000 (1958–59); £650,000 (1959–60); £970,000 (1960–61) and £1,267,289 (1961–62).

As revenue was expected to be substantially below expenditure and the Territory had no central balance the United Kingdom Government approved a grant-in-aid of £1,102,454 for 1962–63.

Currency

During February 1961 the Territory followed the South African change from sterling to a decimalized system of Rands and Cents (£1 sterling = R. 2; 1 shilling = 10 cents). The Standard Bank of South Africa and Barclays Bank (D.C.O.) each have branches at Francistown, Lobatsi and Mahalapye.

Development Plans

Under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act 1959 Bechuanaland received an allocation of £1·5m. in grants and exchequer loans towards development over the period 1959–64. The programme provides for both social and economic projects, the main headings being:

- Agriculture and veterinary: £350,000
- Water supplies: £334,000
- Public building: £416,000
- Education: £208,000
- Roads: £137,650

A further allocation of £165,000 was made in 1961 for development to March 1963. This will be used principally towards Education, Public Works, Agriculture and Veterinary.

Education

There are eight main tribes in the Protectorate. Communications are primitive, distances great and financial resources far from commensurate with urgent needs. Consequently the administration and promotion of African education are unusually difficult.

Most of the administrative work has devolved upon eight tribal central school committees in addition to which there are four committees for non-tribal polyglot areas and in three remote areas education is administered directly by the District Commissioners concerned and the Department of Education.

Primary Education. Enrolled in the 218 African primary schools in the Protectorate during 1961 were 38,067 pupils of whom approximately 56% were girls. The disparity between the sexes, caused by the absence of boys at cattle-posts and on the land, has had a retarding influence ever since schools were first established.

Post-Primary Education. The Bamangwato College was re-constituted as a territorial institution under a Governing Council by Proclamation No. 26 of 1956. All tribes are represented on the Council. A Colonial Development and Welfare grant of £30,000 was made available for the building of a classroom block and this has now been completed. The Government now meets recurrent costs. Secondary boarding schools are conducted by the Roman Catholic Mission at Khale and the L.M.S. at Moeding, while junior secondary day schools exist at Kanye, Mochudi and Molepolole. The total secondary enrolment in 1961 was 817.

Teacher Training. A new teacher training college was completed and occupied in July 1956. Classroom accommodation was extended in 1958. This institution can accommodate at least 100 students, twice the number previously in training. Cost of the buildings, met from Colonial Development and Welfare funds, was over £45,000.

Youth Movements. There are 3,566 Boy Scouts, divided into 69 groups and 4,700 Girl Guides, in 80 groups. Monthly bulletins are issued to all Scout and Guide officers. A Government grant of £200 per year, divided equally between the two movements, is applied chiefly to training and travelling expenses.

The total expenditure on educational service from funds controlled by Government, by Tribal Administrations and by missions during the year 1960 was £312,014. Of this total £34,479 was contributed by Colonial Development and Welfare schemes.

Health

There are four Government hospitals and seven Government Health Centres, together with 41 dispensaries, 16 of which are staffed by resident dispensers. Various missions administer three hospitals and one Health Centre and 34 out-station dispensaries. These hospitals, health centres and dispensaries provide 830 beds and 191 cots, equivalent to one bed or cot to 328 of the population. During 1960 16,709 patients were admitted to hospitals, and attendances for treatment as out-patients numbered 333,475, plus 116,623 attendances for vaccinations, inoculations, etc., making a total of 450,098. Maternity work, including ante-natal and post-natal care, is mainly carried out in the hospitals but there is a special maternity centre administered by the London Missionary Society and supervised by the Government Medical Officer of the District.

The technical staff consists of the Director of Medical Services, Deputy Director of Medical Services, two Medical Officers of Health, eight Medical Officers, three Health Inspectors, one Matron, four Sisters-in-Charge, one Sister Tutor
and 11 Sisters. There is a subsidiary African staff, trained, semi-trained and untrained. In addition there are six medical missionary centres with European and African staff.

African nurses are trained at both Government and Mission hospitals. Midwives are trained at the Government Hospital, Serowe, at the Maun Maternity Centre and the Molopolo Mission. Nurses undergo a three-year course in general nursing, at the end of which they receive a year's training in midwifery.

African Sanitary Inspectors are trained under the supervision of the Health Inspectors.

Communications

The main railway line from Cape Town to the north runs through the Protectorate, entering it at Ramathlabama, 886 miles from Cape Town, and leaving it at Ramaquabane, 398 miles farther north. The line runs roughly parallel to the eastern boundary of the territory at an average distance from it of about 55 miles. The railway within the territory is owned by the Rhodesia Railways and the section Mahalapye/Ramathlabama is operated by the South African Railways Administration as agents. The gauge is 3 feet 6 inches.

The roads are almost exclusively of earth or sand, the only exceptions being short lengths of gravel, and, in two townships, bitumen surfaces over short distances. There is limited bridging over the main rivers.

Twenty-four landing-grounds and emergency strips are maintained in the Protectorate.

Principal Occupations

Over 95% of the population is engaged in stock raising. A few Africans are employed as drovers and herdsmen by European farmers but the great majority are themselves owners of livestock, which are cared for on a family or tribal basis. The principal occupations of the small number of African wage earners are:

Government service ... 3,300*
Agriculture ... 3,500
Building ... 500
Trade and industry ... 3,500
Domestic service ... 2,000

* This figure includes approximately 1,700 casual labourers.

Main Crops and Products

The main occupation of the Bechuana is cattle raising. The number of cattle in 1961 was 1,319,127 of which 12,695 annals and 36,813,034 lb. of carcasses were exported. There were also 373,932 sheep, goats and pigs. Seasonal lack of water and grazing and indifferent animal husbandry are the chief handicaps to the expansion of the industry.

Irregular rainfall and primitive agricultural practices, aggravated by the migration of able-bodied men to work in the Republic are the cause of occasional crop failures. The principal crops are sorghum and beans.

A little gold and some kyanite are mined in the north-east, asbestos near Kanye in the Banwaketse Reserve and manganese in the Bangwaketse and Galesete Reserves.

SWAZILAND

Area

Swaziland, the smallest of the three High Commission territories is bordered on the north, west and south by the Transvaal, on the nor-east by Mozambique and on the south-east by Natal. It lies between latitudes 24° 50' and 26° 40' south and longitudes 30° 25' and 32° 5' east. With a total area of 6,704 square miles, it is a country of many diversities and many distinctive characteristics.
Population

The 1956 Census showed that the population of Swaziland was 240,511. This figure included 11,728 Swazi who were temporarily employed outside the Territory and 3,470 foreign Africans temporarily employed in Swaziland. Africans comprised 97% of the population, Europeans 2.4% and Eurafricans 0.6%. At the end of 1961 the population was probably about 270,000 including approximately 10,800 Swazi temporarily absent. This figure is broken down as follows: 260,000 Swazis, 9,400 Europeans, 2,000 Eurafricans.

Principal Towns

The capital is Mbabane and other principal towns are: Hlatikulu, Mankaiana, Manzini, Piggs Peak and Stegi.

Geographical Features

Geographically and climatically, it is divisible into four physiographic provinces—the broken mountainous high-veld in the west, with altitudes averaging over 4,000 feet, the middle-veld which is mostly mixed farming country about 2,000 feet lower and the low-veld, a hot woodland region typified by aloes, acacias and pterocarpus, and bounded on the east by the Lubombo mountains, with an average altitude of 1,500 feet. The Lubombo mountains form the fourth physiographic province. Four rivers, the Komati, Usutu, Mbuluzi and Ngwavuma, flow from west to east, cutting their way through the Lubombo mountains to the Indian Ocean. The exploitation of these rivers is particularly important to the agricultural development of the middle and bush veld, where irrigation projects are giving the scenery a different aspect.

Climate

75% to 80% of the rains come in the summer half of the year from October to March. Year to year variability of totals is extremely large, especially in the low-veld. Drought hazard is also most serious in the low-veld. The average rainfall at Mbabane in the high-veld is 54.6 inches, at Manzini (formerly Bremersdorp) in the middle-veld 35.9 inches and at Sipofaneni in the low-veld 26.5 inches. The mean maximum and minimum temperatures are respectively 72.6°F. and 51.7°F. at Mbabane; 79.7°F. and 56.4°F.° at Manzini; and 84.4°F. and 59.5°F. at Sipofaneni.

History

Swaziland remained nominally independent until 1890. From 1890 to 1894 the United Kingdom and the Transvaal (South African Republic) Governments established a species of condominium which was replaced in 1894 by an arrangement under which the South African Republic was given powers of protection and administration without actual incorporation. After the Anglo-Boer war, the administration of Swaziland was transferred to the Governor of the Transvaal, who was also the High Commissioner of South Africa, but in 1907 responsibility for Swaziland was transferred from the Governor to the High Commissioner for South Africa. Swaziland therefore remained under the control of the United Kingdom when the Transvaal became a province of the Union of South Africa in 1910.

Constitution

In 1902, at the end of the Anglo-Boer war, the British Special Commissioner with a small force of the South African Constabulary was sent into Swaziland to establish a provisional Administration. Shortly afterwards, an Order in Council dated the 25th of June 1903, was issued which established the relationship between Great Britain and the Swazi and constitutes the basic authority under which the Administration has been conducted by Her Majesty's Government.

At the head of Government is the Resident Commissioner, who is subject to the direction and instructions of the High Commissioner for Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland. The Resident Commissioner exercises such administration and control and is vested with all such powers, authorities and jurisdiction as are conferred upon him by the Swaziland Administration Proclamation of 1904 and other laws, or by the terms of his Commission. He is assisted and advised by the Government Secretary, who is also the Deputy Resident Commissioner, and by the heads of the various Government departments. The Territory is divided into six districts which are administered by District Commissioners stationed at Mbabane, Manzini, Hlatikulu, Piggs Peak, Mankaiana and Stegi. The District Commissioners are the principal executive officers of Government within their districts and directly responsible to the Resident Commissioner for their efficient administration. The Judiciary falls under the Chief Justice of the High Commission Territories.

The Resident Commissioner is advised by the European Advisory Council on matters directly affecting the European residents of Swaziland and on any other matters specifically referred to the Council by the Resident Commissioner. The Territory is divided into ten electoral divisions and each returns one member to the Council, which usually meets twice a year. Urgent matters are, however, dealt with by the Council's Standing Committee. On matters concerning the African population the Resident Commissioner consults the Paramount Chief and through him the Swazi National Council.

The Constitutional Committee set up in 1960 has completed its work and presented its report to the Secretary of State.

A great deal of the structure of the traditional Swazi political system has been retained in the modern pattern of the Swazi National Administration. The Ngwenyama (the Paramount Chief) is the constitutional ruler who is advised by his kinsmen and his chosen Councillors and cannot initiate action without the approval of two formally constituted Councils. The Liqoqo, comprising the more important of Ngwenyama's kinsmen and a number of chosen advisers, and the Libandla, which at its widest extension is a Council of every adult male in the nation. It is recognised as the final body from which approval for any contemplated act or legislation should be obtained.

From the central institutions of the Swazi National Administration, responsibility for the routine administration of the country devolves upon the Chiefs and Indunas.

There are proclaimed townships at Mbabane, Manzini, Stegi, Hlatikulu and Goedgegun. In each of these townships and in Piggs Peak village, an Urban Area Advisory Committee functions under the chairmanship of the District Commissioner and advises him on the administration and welfare of the township and surrounding urban area. These Committees consist of five elected members and Government officials nominated by the Resident Commissioner.
There are, in addition, African Advisory Committees which advise the District Commissioner on the needs of the urban African population. Attention is now being given to the question of granting municipal status to the townships of Mbabane and Manzini, and to the establishment of district councils in the six administrative districts of the Territory. Whilst no formal machinery has been established to effect joint consultation between the different communities in the Territory, Standing Committees of the Swazi Nation and the European Advisory Council, as well as representatives of the Eurafrican Welfare Association, meet together to discuss matters of territorial importance. In terms of the Swaziland General Law and Administration Proclamation—Chapter 3 of the Laws of Swaziland—Roman Dutch Common Law is the common law of the Territory, except where modified by statute. In civil matters Swazi law and custom may be followed where necessary. Statute law consists of Transvaal laws in force at the date of the General Law and Administration Proclamation and all subsequent laws promulgated by the High Commissioner. A Special Court, now the High Court, having the full jurisdiction of a Superior Court, was also established together with Courts of District Commissioners with a limited jurisdiction. A Court of Appeal for Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland was established in 1955, but the right of further appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was retained.

Taxation

The main forms of direct taxation are African tax, European poll tax and income tax, towards which mining companies contribute the major share. The principal sources of indirect taxation are customs and excise duties at varying rates. Swaziland is in a customs union with the Republic of South Africa and receives a fixed percentage of the gross revenue collected on imports into the Republic. Licensing exists for many trades. There are also death duties.

Public Finance

| Year    | Revenue   | Expenditure |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| 1957-58 | £1,684,507 | £1,327,258  |
| 1959-60 | £1,453,389 | £1,629,715  |
| 1960-61 | £1,493,124 | £1,803,737  |
| 1961-62 | £1,667,628 | £2,077,628  |
| 1962-63 | £1,892,583 | £2,325,083  |

Excluding expenditure from Colonial Development and Welfare funds.

Revenue is derived mainly under the following headings for which estimated receipts are given for 1962-63:

- Customs and Excise: £245,510
- Income tax: £892,098
- Posts and telegraphs: £190,372

As revenue was expected to fall below expenditure in 1962-63 and the central balance would be exhausted, the United Kingdom Government approved a grant-in-aid of £435,000.

Currency

The currency in circulation in Swaziland is that of the Republic of South Africa. During February 1961 the Territory followed the South African change from Sterling to a decimalized system of Rands and Cents (£1 sterling = R.2; 1 shilling = 10 cents).

Development Plans

Under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1959, Swaziland received an allocation of a little over £4m. in grants and exchequer loans towards development over the period 1959-64. The programme provides for both social and economic projects, the main headings being:

- Roads: £920,000
- Education: £673,000
- Water supplies: £500,000
- Agriculture: £320,000

A further allocation of £280,000 was made in 1961 for development to March 1963. This will be used principally towards Education, Hospital extensions and Electricity supplies.

The construction of the first railway in Swaziland began in mid-1962 and the line should be open for traffic by the end of 1964. The railway will run a distance of 140 miles to the Mozambique border and will eventually link Swaziland with the port of Lourenço Marques. Its construction will make possible the development of large iron ore deposits at Ngwenya and will facilitate the export of wood pulp and sugar.

Education

African Primary Education is largely the responsibility of a number of Church Missions which receive substantial financial assistance from the Government in the form of salary and equipment grants. Apart from 236 schools falling under the direct superintendence of the Missions there are 19 Government maintained schools, three National schools financed by the Swazi Treasury and 36 tribal schools. Enrolment which stood at 13,797 in 1950 reached 41,262 Swazis in 1962. In addition to the primary schools there are three high schools, 20 junior secondary schools, two Teacher Training Centres, a Housecraft Training Centre and a Trades School which offers courses in building, carpentry, motor mechanics, and electrical wiring and maintenance.

Many bursaries are granted each year to assist students taking secondary school courses leading to matriculation, teacher training courses, post-matriculation courses at University level and various forms of industrial training.

For European children, education is compulsory up to the age of sixteen or the successful completion of Standard VIII. There are two high schools and 11 primary schools with a total enrolment of 1,536 in 1962.

The Coloured, or Eurafrican, community is numerically the smallest group in Swaziland and comprises a wide range of types with varying material and cultural standards. The educational requirements of coloured children are met by five Government-aided Mission boarding-schools, one of which offers secondary education up to matriculation and two to the Junior Certificate. There is also a Housecraft Training Centre for girls, while coloured boys may and do enrol at the Mbabane Trades School. Total enrolment in 1962 was 744.

Health

Posts are provided in the Medical Department for the Director, eleven Medical Officers, two Medical Officers of Health, two Dispenser-torekeepers, four Dispensers, two Matrons, sixteen Nursing Sisters, four Health Inspectors,
ninety Nurses as well as auxiliary medical staff. Seven Doctors and thirteen Nursing Sisters as well as thirty-seven Nurses are employed at Mission Hospitals, subsidised by Government.

There are two Government general hospitals, one at Mbabane and the other at Hlatikulu. In the former there is accommodation for 210 patients and 135 in the latter. There is a 24 bed cottage hospital at Mankaiana and another with 40 beds at Pigg's Peak. The Raleigh Fitkin Memorial Hospital (Nazarene Mission) at Manzini provides accommodation for 230 patients, the Roman Catholic Mission Hospital at Stegi for 35 patients and the Mahamba Methodist Hospital for 55 patients.

There are 11 Government, 16 Mission and three other clinics, financed by the Swazi National Treasury, in the Territory. The headquarters of the public health staff under the Medical Officer of Health is at Manzini where there is a well-equipped laboratory; in addition a Tuberculosis control administrative building and laboratory has been erected.

Communications

The road motor-transport services of the South African Railways Administration and the Portuguese East African Administration carry both goods and passengers and operate between Swaziland and the railheads in the neighbouring territories. A railway line to the Mozambique border is under construction.

The Territory is served by a network of roads which are being rapidly brought to acceptable standards. There is an extensive telecommunications system.

Main Crops and Products

Cattle form the main wealth of the Swazis and the total number owned increased from 146,542 in 1921 to 434,995 in 1949; in 1961 the number was 413,046. The number of cattle owned by others increased from 63,748 in 1921 to 122,330 in 1961. In 1961 there were 219,143 goats, 37,764 sheep and 11,581 pigs.

Slaughter cattle are exported to markets in Johannesburg and Durban which are controlled by export quotas allocated by the South African Meat Industry Control Board. The numbers of cattle exported increased by 3,916 to 21,123 compared with the 1960 figure. Sales of butter locally in 1961 were 177,287 lbs. and 386,700 lbs. were exported.

Mining is an important part of Swaziland's economy. The Havelock asbestos mine in the north-western corner of the Territory is one of the largest asbestos mines in the world and is apparently assured of a life of at least 30 years at present rates of output. Rich deposits of iron ore exist north-west of Mbabane and will be developed as a result of the decision to build a railway link to Mozambique. Other deposits of iron ores are known to occur in the Pigg's Peak, Mankaiana and Hlatikulu districts. There is a small tin-mining industry and barytes is being worked in the Mbabane district. There are extensive deposits of low volatile bituminous and anthracitic coal in the lowveld. The bituminous coal deposits will be worked to provide coal for the railway and the sugar mills in 1963. The refractory minerals diaspore and andalusite are being worked in the Mankaiana district, where pyrophyllite is also being exploited. In the same district considerable tonnages of high grade kaolin are mined. There are three small gold mines in production in the Mbabane and Pigg's Peak districts. Recently further rich gold values have been intersected in exploratory work in the Hoho area. Corundum and beryl have also been found.

The agricultural possibilities of Swaziland are considerable and most crops can be grown. In the past seven years, there has been an immense improvement in agricultural methods among the Swazi due to the stimulus of the rural development schemes which were inaugurated in 1949.

Swaziland has considerable agricultural potential, especially in so far as timber production, irrigated cropping of sugar and citrus, and the dryland production of cotton, pineapples and tobacco are concerned.

During the last ten years much has been done to lay the foundations for the development of this potential, both on Title Deed and Swazi Nation land. One of the most important aspects of this work has been the establishment of an agricultural research service in the Territory.

Maize, which is the staple food of the Swazi, is the most important dryland crop. It is estimated that 370,000 bags of grain were reaped from the 170,000 acres planted to this crop during 1961. In the same year 170,000 bags of maize had to be imported to meet the food requirements of the country, this being mainly attributable to the adverse climatic conditions which prevailed during the growing season.

The most important dryland cash-crop is cotton, the record crop of 1961 being 5,297 short tons worth £359,300. Other important dryland crops produced during 1961 included: 267 short tons of tobacco worth £24,000; 2,500 short tons of pineapples delivered to the local cannery produced 1,145 tons of canned fruit worth £76,800; banana production amounted to 26,000 crates (100 lb.) valued at £36,000.

Irrigation agriculture is centred on three main schemes; that on the Komati River, developed by the Colonial Development Corporation, commands 30,000 acres of irrigable land; the other two privately run projects extract water from the Great Usutu River and command a total of 27,000 irrigable acres. There are numerous minor irrigation schemes throughout the middle and low veld regions. Principal crops grown on these schemes during 1961 were sugar cane, citrus, rice and tomatoes; the production of other irrigated crops such as cotton and maize is being investigated by the research service. During the 1961–62 season sugar production amounted to 76,889 tons of milled sugar valued at £2,355,000 from 665,000 tons of cane delivered to mills; citrus fruit marketed through the local co-operative amounted to 66,500 export cases and 97,000 packets, worth a total of £96,400. There were over 370,000 citrus trees in orchards by the end of the 1961–62 season. The 1961 rice crop, worth £194,500, totalled 4,500 short tons and the winter-grown tomato crop for the same year amounted to 1,681 tons—worth £13,500.

The Republic of South Africa is the principal market for the Territory's agricultural produce, viz.: all cotton, tobacco, rice, bananas and canned tomato and the greater portion of the sugar produced find a ready market in that country. Rice, citrus and tobacco are marketed through co-operative organisations, the last two named being affiliated with similar organisations in the Republic of South Africa.
Considerable development has taken place in the forestry industry during the last two decades. The total area afforested by the end of 1961 was 196,000 acres, of which 180,000 acres were pines.
