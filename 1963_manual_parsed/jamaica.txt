JAMAICA

Following the Referendum in September 1961 which resulted in a majority vote in favour of Jamaica withdrawing from the Federation of The West Indies, legislation was enacted to enable Jamaica to achieve independence.

Agreement was reached at a Conference held in London in January 1962, under the chairmanship of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and Jamaica attained independence and became a member of the Commonwealth on 6th August 1962.

The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations is now the channel of communication between Her Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and Her Majesty’s Government in Jamaica.

Basic information about Jamaica can be found in the 1962 edition of the Colonial Office List.
