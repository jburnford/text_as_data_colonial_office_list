TANGANYIKA

Area
The total area of the territory is 361,800 square miles, which includes 20,650 square miles of inland water. The land area (in square miles) of the nine Provinces and one Extra-provincial District into which Tanganyika is now divided is as follows:

| Province                  | Square Miles |

| Dar es Salaam Extra-provincial District | 50          |

(The areas as shown are approximations to the nearest 50 square miles.)

Population
In June 1958 the total population was estimated to be 8,919,000.

The 1957 census showed that there were 8,665,000 Africans, 20,500 Europeans, 76,500 Indians and Goans, 19,000 Arabs and 7,000 others—total non-African population 123,000. Among the Africans some 120 tribes can be distinguished. Some of these number only a few thousand persons, while the largest tribe in the Territory, the Sukuma, represents 13% of the African population and numbers over one million. Other large tribes in numerical order are the Nyamwezi, Makonde, Haya, Chagga, Gogo and Ha. The ten largest tribes together comprise 43% of the African population.

Geographical Features
The two extremes of topographical relief of the whole continent of Africa lie within the boundaries of the Territory—Kilimanjaro, with a permanent ice-cap, rising to 19,340 feet above sea-level, and the deep trough-like depression filled by the waters of Lake Tanganyika, the world's second deepest lake. Along the coast lies a plain, varying in width from 10 to 40 miles, behind which the country rises gradually to the great central plateau, which for the most part maintains an altitude of some 4,000 feet, is sharply defined along both its eastern and western margins by a series of steep-sided and deeply eroded escarpments, and falls sharply to the west to the level of the lakes (Tanganyika 2,534 feet; Nyasa 1,568 feet)* which lie in the trough of the great Rift Valley. Along both the eastern and western escarpment edges the plateau has been elevated to form long but relatively narrow belts of high country, rising in several places to over 7,000 feet. In the west this belt is cut by the valley of the Malagarasi River. This valley provides a drainage outlet to Lake Tanganyika from a large part of the central plateau, and thus extends the Congo-Atlantic drainage basin to within about 350 miles of the Indian Ocean. The escarpment to the east of Lake Nyasa is broken by the Ruhuhu River. The valley of the Ruhuhu is of importance as forming possibly the only practical alignment for a rail connexion between the coast and Lake Nyasa. Approximately half of the two great lakes, Victoria and Tanganyika, lie within the Territory's borders, and lakes Natron, Manyara, Eyasi (in the north) and Rukwa (in the southwest) account for most of the remainder of the 20,000 square miles of inland water.

Climate
Roughly, three climatic zones can be distinguished:

(i) The coast region and immediately adjoining hinterland—tropical, temperature seldom below 80° during October–May, when the two rainy seasons occur; between June and September it is much cooler; average temperature 76°; average rainfall 40 inches.

(ii) The central plateau, altitudes 2,000–4,000 feet—prevailing characteristics low humidity, rainfall 20–40 inches annually, mean temperature over 70° with great daily and seasonal variations, sometimes exceeding 30° daily; nights almost invariably cool.

(iii) The semi-temperate regions round the slopes of Kilimanjaro (19,340 feet) and Meru (14,979 feet) to the north of the Territory, the "Winter Highlands" further west, the Usambara and Pare Highlands in the north-east, the Fipa Plateau in the south-west, and the mountainous areas to the north and east of Lake Nyasa (5,000 to 10,000 feet); frosts at higher altitudes, nights cold.

Generally speaking, the rainfall is low for a tropical country. Except for the northern and middle sections of the coastal belt, where the advent of the rain is dependent on the south-east and the north-east monsoon currents, and the areas around Lake Victoria and the north of Lake Nyasa—where there are two distinct rainy seasons—the greater part of the Territory has generally a one-season rainfall, beginning in November or December and continuing more or less unbrokenly to the end of April or May.

History
The country now known as Tanganyika came under German influence largely through the initiative of Dr. Karl Peters. In 1884 he journeyed

*Lake Victoria is 3,717 feet above sea level.
into the interior and concluded twelve treaties with chiefs whose chiefdoms were then declared to be German territory. In 1885 the land he had acquired was placed under the protection of the Imperial German Government. A ten-mile belt along the coast was regarded as belonging to Zanzibar, but in 1888 Germany acquired the right of collecting duties on the coast and in 1890 took over the coastal strip on payment of £200,000 to the Sultan of Zanzibar. For some time after their acquisition of the territory the Germans were engaged in quelling risings, and in 1905 there broke out a serious rebellion, known as the "maji-maji" rising, in the southern areas and extending from Lake Nyasa in the interior to Kilwa on the coast.

Soon after the outbreak of the 1914–18 war clashes took place between British and German forces on the northern frontier of the Territory, but the serious attempt to occupy the country did not begin until 1916. By the end of that year all the country north of the Central Railway was occupied by British or Belgian forces and a provisional Civil Administration was established for that area on the 1st January, 1917. In November 1917 the German forces were driven across the Ruvuma River into Portuguese East Africa and the occupation of the whole of the Territory was then completed. By the Treaty of Peace with Germany, signed at Versailles in 1919, Germany renounced in favour of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers all her rights over her overseas possessions, including her East African colony. The Principal Allied and Associated Powers agreed that His Britannic Majesty should exercise a mandate to administer this former German colony, except for the areas of Ruanda and Urundi, for which the mandate was given to the Belgian Government. In 1920 the office of Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Territory was constituted. Since then the administration of the Territory has continued to be carried out under the terms of the mandate until the establishment of the Trusteeship System under the Charter of the United Nations.

**Constitution**

The Territory is administered by the Governor who is assisted by a Council of Ministers and an Executive Council. The Council of Ministers, which is presided over by the Governor, consists of three *ex officio* members (the Chief Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary), all of whom are officials, and nine members appointed by the Governor by Instrument. At present four of the nine appointed members (namely, the Ministers holding the portfolios of Natural Resources, Education and Labour, Security and Immigration, and Provincial Affairs) are officials; the remaining five appointed members (namely, the Ministers holding the portfolios of Health, Lands and Surveys, Mines and Commerce, Social and Co-operative Development, and Urban Local Government and Works) are elected members of the Legislative Council. The seven Ministers who are officials are also *ex officio* members of the Legislative Council.

The Executive Council, which is also presided over by the Governor, comprises the 12 Ministers referred to above, all of whom sit as *ex officio* members, together with five members who do not hold public office and who are appointed by the Governor by Instrument.

In 1957, the Legislative Council (Elections) Ordinance was passed, making provision for the holding of elections to the Legislative Council throughout the territory which was divided into ten constituencies. Elections were held in five of these constituencies in September 1958 and in the other five in February 1959.

The Tanganyika (Legislative Council) Orders in Council 1920 to 1959 provide for a Legislative Council, presided over by a Speaker (appointed by the Governor), consisting of not more than 67 members, of whom 34 form the Government side and 33 the Representative side.

The 34 seats on the Government side are filled by the 7 official Ministers, who are *ex officio* members of Legislative Council, and by not more than 27 members nominated by the Governor. There are at present only 16 nominated members; these, together with the 7 official Ministers and the 5 Ministers who are elected members of Legislative Council, make a total on the Government side of 28.

Provision is made for the 33 seats on the Representative side to be filled by 30 members elected to represent the ten constituencies (10 Africans, 10 Asians and 10 Europeans) and by 3 members, appointed by the Governor, to represent special interests. The three latter seats are, at present, unfilled.

At the present time, therefore, the Representative side consists of 25 elected members (since 5 of the 30 elected members sit as Ministers on the Government side), and the Government side of 28 members as indicated above. Of the 16 nominated members on the Government side, 7 are Africans, 4 are Asians and 5 are Europeans (of whom one is an official). Of the 45 unofficial members of Council, 17 are Africans, 14 Asians and 14 Europeans.

**Land Policy**

Subject to the validity of any title to land or any interest therein lawfully acquired before the 26th January, 1923, the whole of the lands of the Territory, whether occupied or unoccupied on that date, were declared to be public lands under the control of and subject to the disposition of the Governor, to be held and administered by him for the use and common benefit, direct or indirect, of the natives of the Territory. No title to the occupation and use of any such lands is valid without the consent of the Governor who, in the exercise of his powers, is obliged to have regard to native laws and customs. The only grants of freehold title which the Governor may make over public land are grants to give effect to a contract or undertaking by the former German Government, certain grants by way of exchange for freehold land acquired by the Governor, and grants to the Board of Trustees of the Tanganyika Higher Education Trust Fund. The Governor may, where it appears to him to be in the general interests of the Territory, make grants of Rights of Occupancy over public land to both native and non-native persons for terms not exceeding 99 years and subject to the payment of a suitable rental, revisable at intervals of not more than thirty-three years. Land lawfully used or occupied by a native or native community in accordance with native law and custom is deemed to be held on a Right of Occupancy.

**Taxation**

The tax system includes indirect taxation in the form of import, export and excise duties, stamp duties, and miscellaneous licence fees.
Particulars of direct taxation are set out below.

(a) Personal Tax is payable by all males over 18, irrespective of race; the rates are related to an individual's chargeable income. The minimum and maximum rates payable per annum are Shs. 12/- and Shs. 180/- respectively.

(b) Non-Native Education Tax is payable by every male non-native over 18 resident in the Territory, and assessed on Personal Tax payable.

(c) Municipal House Tax is levied on owners of houses in townships, not including native dwellings, at rates not exceeding 15% of the net annual value of the house. The tax is not leviable in those townships where local rates are in force.

(d) Income Tax—Resident individuals pay 2/- in the £ on the first £400 of chargeable income, 3/- in the £ on the next £400, 4/- in the £ on the next £400, 5/- in the £ on the next £400, 6/- in the £ on the next £500, 8/- in the £ on the next £500, 9/- in the £ on the next £1,000, 10/- in the £ on the next £1,000, 11/- in the £ on the next £1,000, 12/- in the £ on the next £1,000, 13/- in the £ on the next £1,000, 14/- in the £ on the next £1,000, 15/- in the £ on every pound after £9,000.

Non-resident individuals pay at the rate of 2/- in the £ where the chargeable income does not exceed £800. Where it exceeds £800 the rates of tax as for residents apply. The chargeable income of individuals is calculated by deducting the total of personal allowances which can be claimed from the total income figure.

Limited Companies pay at the rate of Shs.5/50 in the £ on income as computed for Income Tax purposes.

* Contributions from Territorial to Development Funds are excluded from the former's expenditure and the latter's revenue.

† Since 1st July, 1954, the financial year has run from the 1st July to the 30th June. An interim budget covered the first six months of 1954.

In 1958/59 the sum of over £8½ million was received from Customs and Excise duties, nearly £6½ million from licences and taxes, and over £3½ million on Development Plan Account.

In the same year the main heads of expenditure were over £5½ million on Development Plan Account, over £2½ million Public Works, £3 million Education (including expenditure by non-native Education Authorities), over £1½ million Medical Services, nearly £1½ million Police, £1 million Provincial Administration, over £889,000 for Pensions and Gratuities, £675,000 for Defence, over £630,000 for Agriculture, over £440,000 for Veterinary and over £916,000 East Africa High Commission.

The Public Debt at 30th June, 1959, amounted to £17,108,212 (approximately £1 18s. 0d. per head of population) and comprised:

Currency

This is issued by the East African Currency Board in London. The British East Africa shilling is the standard coin. Subsidiary coins are of the following denominations: 1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents and 50 cents. There are 100 cents to the shilling. Currency notes are issued in the following denominations: Sh. 5/-, Sh. 10/-, Sh. 20/-, Sh. 100/- and Sh. 1,000/-.

Development Plans

Since 1948 there has been a steady rate of development and it is anticipated that this development will continue at a rate of £4 million per annum of capital expenditure. The following figures are of interest in illustrating the development which has taken place in the past nine years:

| Year    | Amount     |
|---------|------------|
| 1950    | 3,438,000  |
| 1951    | 3,830,000  |
| 1952    | 5,009,310  |
| 1953    | 3,699,000  |
| 1954 (First six months) | 1,600,785 |
| 1954/55 | 3,657,997  |
| 1955/56 | 4,283,672  |
| 1956/57 | 5,431,060  |
| 1957/58 | 5,597,890  |
| 1958/59 | 5,274,892  |

These funds come from a variety of sources but the main items are Loan Funds, Colonial Development and Welfare grants and contributions from Tanganyika Revenue.

The revised Development Plan covering the period July 1957 to June 1961 envisaged expenditure of £26·9 million. Of this sum, 52% was for basic development—communications, public works and township services; 26% for the development of social services and urban housing; and 22%, for the provision of increased agricultural productivity, rural water supplies, bush clearing and resettlement, forestry, veterinary and co-operative development training, research and extension work. The position is under review and account will be taken of the recommendations of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development Survey Mission, which visited the territory in 1959, in drawing up a new development plan for the period July 1960 to June 1965.

Other Development

The Colonial Development Corporation's wattle plantations in the Njombe district now extend over an area of 33,000 acres.

The modified programme pursued by the Tanganyika Agricultural Corporation lays stress on such crops as soya beans, maize, simsim, and tobacco, in addition to groundnuts. Ranching
is being undertaken at Kongwa and in an area near the Ruvu River some 50 miles west of Dar es Salaam.

Following on a preliminary reconnaissance by an F.A.O. expert in 1953, a survey of the Rufiji basin is being undertaken by the Tanganyika Agricultural Corporation, on behalf of the Tanganyika Government, assisted by a team of F.A.O. experts. The project is being financed mainly from Colonial Development and Welfare funds. The object of the survey is to lay down the main lines of the development of the basin and to ensure that such development as is immediately possible is in line with the overall scheme. The first major step in development has been the initiation in 1959 of a scheme for irrigated tenant farming which will eventually cover some 5,000 acres.

The Mbeya Exploration Co. Ltd. continued its experimental work in the pilot mill near Mbeya in the Southern Highlands Province where large reserves of niobium bearing carbonatite have been proved.

Progress was also made at the Kiabakari Gold Mine in Musoma District, and at the Kyerwa tin mine in Karagwe District.

The acquisition of Williamson Diamonds Ltd. jointly by De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. and the Tanganyika Government on an equal shares basis was an important feature of the year.

In Kilwa District the drilling of the third deep test well in East Africa for oil by BP Shell Petroleum Development Co. (T) Ltd. began in March, 1958, and has since been completed. No oil was found but remarkable thicknesses of rock salt were revealed which may become an important mineral asset. Significant thicknesses of gypsum and anhydrite were also revealed.

In the Northern Province investigations on the phosphate deposit are being continued by New Consolidated Goldfields Ltd.

Education

Facilities for higher education are provided by the University College of Makerere at Kampala, Uganda, and at the Royal Technical College of East Africa, Nairobi. There are 215 students from Tanganyika at Makerere and 27 at the Royal Technical College.

There are about 251 students from Tanganyika receiving post-secondary education in the United Kingdom at the present time, and 54 in other countries.

The system of African education provides for three stages up to secondary level; the Primary School Standards I-IV, the Middle School V-VIII and the Secondary School IX-XIII inclusive. In addition, Higher School Certificate classes were opened in January, 1959, at three boys secondary schools and at one girls secondary school. In 1958 the number of pupils attending schools was as follows: Primary pupils 366,690; Middle school pupils 36,611; Secondary pupils 3,499; Teacher Training Centres 1,784; Technical and vocational training 2,035.

In 1958, eight Government Primary Schools, 15 assisted schools, nine unaided schools, together with a Government Correspondence Course, gave primary education to 2,356 European children and 431 received secondary education at one Government school and one assisted school, while about 770 received grants towards the cost of secondary education outside the territory.

Indian pupils numbering 16,217 attended three Government, 119 assisted and three unassisted primary schools; and 6,992 Indians received secondary education at five Government and 27 assisted schools. Another 958 non-Africans received primary education, and 361 secondary education, at assisted schools for other non-Africans including Goans.

Expenditure on educational services during 1958-59 (excluding £1,115,129 spent on capital works) amounted to £3,288,804. This total includes contributions amounting to £261,135 from Local Authorities and expenditure met from Non-Native Education Authority funds amounting to £832,728. In 1935 the total expenditure was £81,100.

Libraries

In Dar es Salaam there are the King George V Museum Library, the Arnautoglu Library which caters for all races and contains books in English, Swahili and Arabic, The British Council Library, and the High Court Library, which is open to all members of the Legal Department, to other serving officers of the Colonial Legal Service and to Advocates who have been admitted to practice in Her Majesty's High Court of Tanganyika and courts subordinate thereto.

The East African Literature Bureau runs postal and Book Box Services throughout the territory for African readers and the Social Development Department of the Tanganyika Government runs a combined book and cinema van and libraries at various community centres to serve Africans outside Dar es Salaam. In addition various schools, clubs and other institutions have libraries in Dar es Salaam and elsewhere.

Health

There are 643 out-patient dispensaries maintained by Native Authorities, five by Government, 136 by grant-earning missions and 299 by private bodies and industry. The Native Authorities maintain 183 maternity and child health clinics, Government 120 and missions 204. There are 19 major leprosaria of which some are maintained by Government and some by grant-aided missions. Government, missions and industrial concerns maintain a total of 225 hospitals and bedded dispensaries with 13,861 beds. During 1958, 273,160 in-patients and 15,679,103 out-patients were treated at Government and mission hospitals and dispensaries, and at Native Authority dispensaries.

Total estimated expenditure on medical and allied services in 1958-59 was £2,065,062. In 1935 expenditure amounted to £193,930. These figures exclude such items as medical building works provided for in the Public Works estimates and public health measures undertaken by the various township authorities or the expenditure on medical services by industry and voluntary agencies.

These steamer services connect the railways of Tanganyika with those of Kenya and Uganda and the transport systems of the Belgian Congo, Ruanda Urundi and Northern Rhodesia.

Broadcasting

The Tanganyika Broadcasting Service was handed over on the 1st July, 1956 to an Independent Statutory Corporation which has full authority to develop the Service as it sees fit. The project, however, is still financed by means of a subvention from Government funds. The transmitters (5·0kW and 20kW) and studios are in Dar es Salaam. Licences cost 10/- and in 1958 more than 19,200 were issued.

Principal Occupations

Most of the self-employed indigenous inhabitants are engaged in agriculture. The numbers of African adult males employed (at a census held during the third quarter of 1958) are classified in the following major industrial groups:
