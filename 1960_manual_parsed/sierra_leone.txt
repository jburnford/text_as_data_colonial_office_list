SIERRA LEONE

Area

The total area is 27,925 square miles (Colony 256, Protectorate 27,669). The Protectorate is divided into three Provinces (Northern 13,925, South-Western 7,868 and South-Eastern 5,876 square miles).

Population

The latest estimate of population was 2,260,000 (Colony 130,000; Protectorate 2,130,000). Twenty-five per cent. of the Africans in the Colony are settlers and their descendants. Apart from these,
and about 2,000 Europeans and Asians, the population is tribal, mainly Mende and Temne.

| Freetown, capital        | 100,000              |
| Bo, S.W. Province        | 20,000               |

| Makeni, N. Province      | 7,500                |

Geographical Features

Geographically the territory falls into three main zones:

(i) The Colony Peninsula, 25 miles long and ten miles wide, is mostly mountainous and the highest point is almost 3,000 feet above sea level. Rivers rising in this area are mountain torrents and not navigable.

(ii) A belt of plains, with mangrove swamps on its sea margin, extends to a width of 50 miles. There are many rivers traversing this belt almost all of which are navigable for at least part of their length.

(iii) Rising ground in the east and north-east of the Protectorate, which reaches 6,000 feet, forms an upland plateau in which most of the Sierra Leone rivers have their source. Agriculture tends to give way to cattle in the remoter parts of this area.

Climate

There are two distinct seasons: the dry season from November until April, and the wet season, which extends over the rest of the year. Rain is heaviest on the coast, especially on high ground. Most of the rain falls in the three months July-September. The mean temperature is approximately 80°, but whereas on the coast the mean range of temperature is approximately 10°, inland it is approximately 20° on the eastern boundary. Relative humidity also has a much larger range inland, approximately 12% on the coast, and 25-30% inland.

History

The Colony of Sierra Leone originated in the sale and cession of a portion of land by "King" Naimbana and his subordinate chiefs to Captain John Taylor in 1788 on behalf of the "free community of settlers, their heirs and successors, lately arrived from England, and under the protection of the British Government". This portion of land was described in the treaty as extending from the bay commonly called Frenchman's Bay, but of which the name was changed to St. George's Bay, coastwise up the River Sierra Leone to Gambia Island, and southerly or inland from the riverside 20 miles.

The main purpose of the Colony in its inception was to secure a home on the African continent for a number of natives of Africa, and some others, who, due to various circumstances, had been separated from their countries of origin, and were destitute in and about London. Subsequently the settlement was used for Africans rescued from slave ships and also for Africans repatriated from North America. The territory received additions from time to time by various concessions from the native chiefs. Thus, in 1807, "King" Farima and "King" Tom ceded all the land they possessed in the peninsula of Sierra Leone lying to the westward of the settlement and on 1st January, 1808, the whole settlement became a Crown Colony; in 1861 Bai Conteh, "King" of Koya, with his chiefs, ceded a portion of the Koya country abutting on the Colony of Sierra Leone. In 1825 the Governor made a treaty of cession with various chiefs in, and in the neighbourhood of, Sherbro Island, for the purpose of adding these countries to the territories of the Colony. The treaty, not immediately ratified by the Crown, was revived by a new agreement made in 1882. Other treaties of cession were made from time to time.

On 31st August, 1896, a proclamation was issued declaring a Protectorate over the hinterland of Sierra Leone, and Ordinances were passed providing for the administration of this Protectorate.

Constitution

That part of Sierra Leone administered as a Colony includes the Sierra Leone Peninsula, Tasso Island, Banana Island, and York Island, and the township of Bontho on Sherbro Island.

The Sierra Leone (Constitution) Order in Council, 1958, provides for an Executive Council consisting of the Governor as President, a Premier and not less than seven other Ministers. Like the Premier, they are appointed from the Elected Members of the House of Representatives.

The same Order in Council provides for a House of Representatives consisting of a Speaker, 51 elected members and two nominated members, the last to have no voting powers. Of the 51 elected members, 14 represent Freetown and the Colony area, 25 represent Electoral Districts in the Protectorate, and the remaining 12 are Paramount Chiefs elected by the 12 District Councils in the Protectorate. Elections to the new House on a franchise extended to include virtually all adult males and all adult female taxpayers or property owners, were held in May 1957 and the House met for the first time in July 1957.

With regard to the Protectorate, in 1951, under the provisions of the District Councils Ordinance, 1950, the basis of representation of Chiefdoms in the District Councils was broadened by the addition of three members who may be either appointed by the Chiefdom representatives in the District Council or elected for a particular area. By the same Ordinance executive and financial responsibilities were vested in the Councils to enable them to take their full part in the development of the Protectorate. Their revenues are derived from Native Administrations and from grants made by Government and by the Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board.

Land Policy

In the Protectorate land may not be alienated though it may be leased for a term not exceeding
50 years to non-natives with the consent of a Tribal Authority and the approval of the District Commissioner. In the Colony individual ownership is recognized and there is no restriction on alienation to non-natives.

Taxation

There are two forms of direct taxation in force: income tax and local tax. Income tax is chargeable on individuals at graduated rates (beginning at 6d. in the £) subject to personal reliefs and other deductions. An unmarried man is granted £300, and a married man £500 as an initial relief; there are allowances up to a maximum of £400 for children (not more than eight) up to the age of 16 years or so long as they are receiving whole-time education; and for life assurance premiums within certain limits. Companies pay a flat rate of 9s. in the £. A double taxation agreement has been concluded with Her Majesty's Government and with a number of other Governments including Ghana, Nigeria and Gambia.

With effect from the 1st April 1960, the Income Tax scale of allowances is being reduced in order to bring within the orbit of the taxation system salaries at a lower level. An attempt has been made by means of an abatement at the 1s. rate of tax to avoid increasing the incidence of tax on those taxpayers who pay at the full 1s. rate or more e.g. from the 1st April 1960 a single man will be given only £200 personal allowance and a married man £300 in place of £300 and £500 respectively. These reductions will be chargeable at 6d. The next £400 of chargeable income will be chargeable at 6d. also, but from the 1s. tax will be abated the amount (or part of it) that has been paid at 6d. on the reduced allowances.

A Local Tax Ordinance introduced in 1954 replaces the House Tax, formerly paid by all adult native males, by a Local Tax. This is at present subject to a maximum of 25s. per head, and within chiefdoms is paid at a fixed rate. In general terms payment applies to all adult male persons residing in each chiefdom and in certain cases to adult females also. Revenue from this tax is divided between District Councils and Native Administrations.

The main form of indirect taxation is the Customs tariff.

| Year | Revenue | Expenditure |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1938 | 886,149 | 910,077     |
| 1954 | 7,621,299| 6,863,115   |
| 1955 | 7,545,788| 7,397,335   |

| 1958 | 10,517,835| 10,886,157  |

In 1958, £6,060,516 of total revenue was derived from Customs and £2,372,473 from taxes. In the same year, the main heads of expenditure were:

- Development Schemes £1,115,112,
- Medical and Education Services £2,171,939,
- Public Works and Electricity recurrent £1,331,005,
- Non-recurrent Public Works £479,898,
- Law and Order £925,847,
- Provincial Administration and the Secretariat £223,833.

The Public Debt at the end of December 1958 amounted to £6,680,152.

Currency

The currency in circulation is issued by the West African Currency Board in London on behalf of the British West African territories. It consists of notes of 100/-, 20/- and 10/-; yellow metal alloy coins of 2/-, 1/- and 6d.; nickel coins of 3d., 1d. and ½d. In addition bronze coins of 1d. and ½d. are now in circulation. The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

Development Plans

"An Outline of the Ten-Year Plan for the Development of Sierra Leone" was published in 1946 (and reviewed in 1949 when "A Plan of Economic Development for Sierra Leone" was published). The Plans provided for the development of Communications, Natural Resources and Social and Basic Services at a total cost of £5,000,000 in the ten-year period.

Under the new Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1959, an allocation of £2,000,000 has been made and a new Development Programme is in process of being drawn up. Agreement in principle has also been given for an Exchequer loan from the United Kingdom of £3,000,000, the greater part of which will be spent in 1959–60 to finance the continuation of schemes started under the original Development Plan of 1949.

A Colonial Development and Welfare allocation of £450,000 has also been made for capital works at Fourah Bay College.

Education

University courses in Theology, Arts, Science, Economic Studies and Education are provided at Fourah Bay College (University of Durham), Freetown. At the beginning of the 1958–59 session, 286 students were in attendance at these courses and, apart from scholarships for secondary education and teacher training, 114 scholarships were awarded, 58 for higher education, including study overseas. About 36 students were known to be studying in the U.S.A.

There are five Teacher Training Colleges and one Teacher Training Department in the territory; 604 students were in training in 1958.

There are seven Government secondary schools and 17 assisted secondary schools in which 5,452 pupils were enrolled in 1958. There are also two unassisted secondary schools which had 452 pupils. Two Government, 495 assisted and 25 unassisted primary schools had an enrolment of 69,276 pupils.

In 1958 there were two technical schools with 265 full-time and 872 part-time students, a vocational centre for girls with an enrolment of 68.
and 3 pre-training centres for unqualified teachers with 117 students.

Literacy campaigns were conducted in 1958 by the Protectorate Literature Bureau in 66 chiefdoms, and 546 reading certificates were issued. The Bureau reported that in ten years 45,200 people were estimated to have attained literacy in one vernacular, while 311,532 books in five vernaculars (Mende, Temne, Limba, Kono, and Koranko), had been sold, 144,943 of them within the last five years of the period.

The Extramural Department of Fourah Bay College, the British Council and the Social Development Department organized adult education courses in various subjects.

Recurrent expenditure on education was £1,619,956 in 1958. In 1935 total expenditure amounted to £38,518.

Libraries

Fourah Bay College has a library of some 22,000 volumes. The British Council maintains a subscription library of over 27,000 books and despatches bulk loans, book-boxes and periodicals to the Protectorate at regular intervals. In Freetown there are also two small public libraries. The British Council has opened up a new centre at Bo and branch libraries at Kenema and Makeni.

Health

Diseases contended with in Sierra Leone, in addition to such infections as typhoid and dysentery, which are common, include malaria, schistosomiasis, leprosy, tuberculosis, goitre, rabies, yellow fever, trypanosomiasis, smallpox, cerebro-spinal fever and yaws. The incidence of the last five is comparatively low. The Health Service includes an Endemic Diseases Control Unit, an Entomological Laboratory and the former Malaria Control Unit.

In 1958 beds available in hospitals (including two Infirmarys and a maternity hospital) totalled 1,551 (Government 1,173, Missions 284, Mining 94). In-patients numbered 20,285 and out-patients 257,559. There were 39 Government dispensaries and Health Centres (excluding 24 treatment centres attached to the Endemic Diseases Control Unit) at which 132,134 new cases were treated.

Actual expenditure on medical and allied services in 1958 was £1,023,721. By comparison actual expenditure in 1935 was £63,923.

Communications

Freetown Airport (Lungi) is the international airport, and is operated by the Government Department of Civil Aviation. Scheduled Air Services are operated by Air France, Ghana Airways, Hunting-Clan/Airwork Services, Nigerian Airways and U.A.T. They connect Sierra Leone to other parts of West Africa and provide at least seven services a week to and from Europe.

Air and marine navigational aids, and aeradio and meteorological radio services, are also provided.

The railway carried 1,596,332 passengers and 133,886 tons of freight in 1958. The gauge of the railway is 2 ft. 6 in. and the mileage maintained (including sidings) totalled 339. This mileage includes a branch line covering a distance of 83½ miles. The Marampa railway (3 ft. 6 in. gauge) is operated by the Sierra Leone Development Company Limited for the purpose of carrying iron ore from Marampa to Pepel, a distance of 57½ miles.

There are 3,442 miles of road, 1,642 miles of first class roads maintained by the Public Works Department and 1,800 miles of roads maintained by local Government bodies and private companies. Freetown, a port of British Shipping Registry, has anchorage room for 240 ships of unrestricted draught and berths for two large or three small ships alongside the new Queen Elizabeth II Quay, which is 1,206 feet long with a depth of 32 feet of water at Mean Low Water Ordinary Springs. Oil bunkers can be obtained by ships alongside the Quay, and ships also berth alongside the nearby Kissy Oil Jetty for oil bunkers, or to discharge various types of fuel into the Oil Storage Company's tanks. Smaller ports are at Pepel and Bonthe. Pepel is a loading port for iron ore from the Marampa mines; Bonthe is a loading port for local produce such as palm kernels, palm oil and piassava. Regular passenger and cargo services to the United Kingdom are provided by Elder Dempster Lines Limited and Palm Lines Limited. Twenty-four other shipping lines provide services to the Continent, the Middle East, South Africa, India, the Far East and America.

The total of inland waterways is approximately 493 miles but several of these rivers are only navigable for three months of the year when the rivers are in flood. A considerable amount of local produce is transported to Freetown by launches from the Great and Little Scarcies River in the north and Bonthe River to the south.

Broadcasting

The Sierra Leone Broadcasting Service, transmitting from Freetown, was inaugurated in 1955 and at present operates from 6·45 to 8·00 a.m. and 4·45 to 10·00 p.m. on the frequency of 3,316 kilocycles in the 90 metre band with a power of 5 kilowatts. The Service consists of approximately 4½ hours' local programme and the remainder re-radiated B.B.C. Overseas Service.

The Department of Broadcasting came into being on 1st January, 1958, the programme side of the Sierra Leone Broadcasting Service having broken away from the former Public Relations (now Information) Department. The transmitters were taken over from Posts and Telecommunications Department early in 1959. Completely new Studio equipment is being installed under the supervision of the Chief Engineer. It is planned to install new and more powerful transmitters on another site as soon as possible. The hours of broadcasting will be extended in 1960.

On the 31st December, 1958, the number of licences issued to owners of private sets was 3,146, and the number of subscribers to the Government operated wire system in Freetown was 4,295.

Principal Occupations

It is estimated that over half the population is engaged in agriculture. Returns from employers of six or more workers show the numbers employed in the main industrial groups at the end of 1958 to be as follows:

| Industry                        | Number |
|--------------------------------|--------|
| Building and Construction       | 7,556  |
| Mining                         | 6,596  |
| Transport (road, rail and air)  | 6,964  |
| Maritime and Waterfront         | 2,048  |
| Commerce                       | 5,568  |
| Public Administration Offices   | 5,666  |
| Others                         | 9,931  |

These workers served the following employers: Government 23,834; Native administrations
In addition an estimated 34,000 workers were employed by smaller employers i.e. of less than six persons. During 1958 the average monthly figure of all workers in wage-earning employment was approximately 79,000.

There were, at the end of 1958, 14 registered trade unions; eleven of these, including one employer's union with 18 members, had a total membership of 27,606. The membership figure of the remaining three unions, including two employers' unions, is not available.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops and products are palm kernels and palm oil, piassava, rice, cocoa, coffee, groundnuts, cassava, benniseed, kola-nuts, bananas and ginger.

The livestock population (rough estimate) is: cattle 150,000, goats 21,500, sheep 10,000, pigs 5,000.

The main timber products are sawn timber, shingles, roundwood, firewood, charcoal and gum copal. Sawn timber is not available for export but small quantities of gum copal and charcoal are exported.

Inshore fishing by African fishermen is extensive but insufficient to meet the demand in Freetown and the Protectorate. The operation of commercial trawlers from Sierra Leone in recent years has contributed significantly to the local supply of fish.

The chief minerals mined are iron-ore, diamonds and chrome ore. Small quantities of gold are also found. Other minerals known to occur in Sierra Leone are platinum, ilmenorutile, lignite, cassiterite and molybdenite.

Nine pioneer oil mills for the expression of palm oil are operated by the Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board. An oil-expressing plant for the production of groundnut oil and palm kernel oil is being operated by Government. Government also operates two small and three large rice mills and there are a number of privately-owned mills. Connected with the Government rice mills is the complementary enterprise of pig and poultry feed production.

Furniture making is carried on by Government and private enterprise.

Village industries include fishing, fish curing and smoking, weaving, and hand methods of expressing palm oil and cracking palm kernels.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The Sierra Leone Produce Marketing Board was set up under Ordinance No. 1 of 1949, the objects being to secure the most favourable arrangements for the purchase, marketing and export of Sierra Leone produce, and to assist, by all possible means, in the development of the agricultural industry in Sierra Leone and of secondary industries connected with it.

On 31st December, 1958, there were 328 co-operative societies with a membership of 20,000. Their turnover for the year was roughly £433,000.

The most important new development has been the formation of the South East Co-operative Federation Limited, which includes all cocoa and coffee marketing societies in the province, and its appointment as a buying agent of the Produce Marketing Board, starting work in September, 1958. All "co-operative" cocoa is being handled by it, the total at the end of the year being 40% of the country's cocoa for the season. The value of cocoa co-operatively marketed during the year has risen from £126,000 to £154,000.

The mechanized cultivation of rice has continued with some success. Rice marketing turnover has been increased to £107,000.

The amount guaranteed by Government to be operated through the Registrar's Loan Account has been increased to £200,000. Of this, some £60,000 is utilized to finance the cocoa-buying agency work in addition to a maximum of £50,000 made available by the banks as commercial produce advances. About £100,000 is being used for normal short term credit.
