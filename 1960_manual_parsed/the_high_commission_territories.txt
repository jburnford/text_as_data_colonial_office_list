THE HIGH COMMISSION TERRITORIES

(BASUTOLAND, THE BECHUANALAND PROTECTORATE AND SWAZILAND)

The Colony of Basutoland and the Protectorates of Bechuanaland and Swaziland in southern Africa are administered on behalf of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom by a High Commissioner. The High Commissioner also holds the office of High Commissioner for the United Kingdom in the Union of South Africa. He is the sole legislative authority for Basutoland, the Bechuanaland Protectorate and Swaziland and is responsible to the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations in the same way as a Colonial Governor is responsible to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

Each Territory is administered by a Resident Commissioner, responsible to the High Commissioner, and is divided into administrative districts in charge of District Commissioners.

Information about these Territories will be found in The Commonwealth Relations Office List. This brief note, and the following Civil Establishment list showing heads and deputy heads of departments and analogous appointments, have been included in The Colonial Office List 1960, because the staffs of these Territories are interchangeable with the staffs of the territories administered under the direction of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Biographical notes are included in the Record of Services section.

Secretary—I. S. De Souza.

On the establishment of the Federation of The West Indies in January 1958 (see page 192) this Office, hitherto known as the Office of the Trade Commissioner for the British West Indies, British Guiana and British Honduras, became a federal responsibility and was created a Commission incorporating the agency formerly known as the British Caribbean Welfare Service.

The Commissioner represents the Governments of The West Indies and British Guiana and British Honduras. The units of the Federation are Antigua, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Christopher, Nevis and Anguilla, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Trinidad and Tobago.

The main functions of the Commission are promotion of trade, tourism, industry and investment; the administration of Government Scholarships, placing and general welfare of students; reception and welfare of migrants from the West Indies and community development; recruitment and information services. The Commission is organized in five Divisions.

REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

A feature of British colonial policy is the encouragement of regional co-operation between Colonies, wherever practicable. In this way there is not only a valuable sharing of knowledge and experience, but also, in certain instances, a substantial measure of economy from the unified control of technical services. The following are the principal regional organizations.

CIVIL AVIATION

(a) British Caribbean Air Transport Advisory Council

The former Directorate-General of Civil Aviation in the British Caribbean was abolished in May 1954, and in July of the same year the British Caribbean Air Transport Advisory Council was established for the co-ordination of civil aviation activities in the region. The Governments represented on the Council were those of Barbados, British Guiana, British Honduras, Jamaica, the Leeward Islands, Trinidad and Tobago and the Windward Islands. With the setting-up of the federation of The West Indies in 1958, the functions of the Council Secretariat were taken over by the Federal Government, and the future arrangements for co-ordinating civil aviation in the Caribbean are under review.

(b) East Africa.

The East African Air Transport Authority was set up by Order in Council in 1945, to control aircraft flying for hire and reward. The functions of the Authority were taken over on the 1st January, 1948, by the East Africa High Commission.

Following a meeting of the East Africa High Commission in March 1951, an Air Advisory Council was set up by administrative action pending the necessary legal enactment to establish the Council as a statutory body. The Council, which meets about twice a year, consists of the Commissioner for Transport as ex officio chairman, two members appointed by each of the Governments of Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda and one by the British Resident, Zanzibar, and in addition two members appointed by the High Commission.

The functions of the Council are:

(i) to be advisory to the East Africa High Commission, whose authority is exercised through the Commissioner for Transport;

(ii) to advise on all questions of major policy affecting Civil Aviation within the jurisdiction of the East Africa High Commission and on any civil aviation matters referred to it by the East Africa High Commission acting through the Commissioner for Transport;

(iii) to advise on the Annual Estimates of the Directorate of Civil Aviation before they are submitted to the Central Legislative Assembly and the Estimates Committee of the Central Legislative Assembly;
(iv) to advise on all Civil Aviation legislation coming within the scope of the Central Legislative Assembly;

(v) to advise on the steps necessary to achieve a policy of co-ordination between Civil Aviation and all other forms of transport.

Director of Civil Aviation, East Africa—J. J. Furniss.

EAST AFRICA HIGH COMMISSION

CONSTITUTION, SCOPE AND LEGISLATIVE POWERS

The establishment of an East Africa High Commission (headquarters are at Nairobi, Kenya), with effect from 1st January, 1948, to replace the East African Governors' Conference, was announced in the House of Commons by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 28th July, 1947.

The High Commission, consisting of the Governors of Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda, was constituted by Order in Council and was charged with the administration of the following services:

(1) The Secretariat of the High Commission.
(2) The East African Anti-Locust Directorate.
(3) The East African Directorate of Civil Aviation.
(4) The East African Directorate of Training.
(5) The East African Income Tax Department.
(6) The East African Industrial Council.
(7) The East African Inter-Territorial Languages Committee.
(8) The East African Office in London.
(9) The East African Posts and Telegraphs Department.
(10) The East African Committee for Economic Co-ordination.
(11) The East African Publicity Committee.
(12) The East African Refugee Administration.
(13) The East African Research Services.
(14) The East African Statistical Department.
(15) The East African Tsetse Reclamation Department.
(16) The Lake Victoria Fisheries Board.
(17) The East African Meteorological Department.
(18) Services connected with the maintenance of contact between the Territories and the Defence Services.
(19) Services arising out of the functions of the High Commission as East African Air Transport Authority.
(20) Services of Inter-Territorial import arising from the operation in the Territories of the East African Currency Board.

The East African Directorate of Training and the East African Refugee Administration completed their tasks and ceased to operate in 1949 and 1951 respectively. The administration of the East African Inter-Territorial Languages (Swahili) Committee was taken over by Makerere College in 1952. The East African Publicity Committee has not been formed. In 1960, when the Lake Victoria Fisheries service was disbanded, the Lake Victoria Fisheries Board ceased to operate.

In 1948 the following additional services fell, upon their formation, within the administrative sphere of the High Commission:

The East African Railways and Harbours Administration.
The East African Literature Bureau.
The Desert Locust Survey.

On the 1st January, 1948, the East African Research Services included:

(a) The East African Agriculture and Forestry Research Organization.
(b) The East African Veterinary Research Organization.
(c) The East African Fishery Research Organization.
(d) The East African Industrial Research Board.

Since that date the following Research and Scientific Services have been added:

(a) The Desert Locust Survey and Control.
(b) The East African Medical Survey.
(c) The East African Virus Research Institute.
(d) The East African Institute of Malaria and Vector-borne Diseases.
(e) The East African Leprosy Research Centre.
(f) The East African Marine Fisheries Research Organization.

The East African Customs and Excise Department was formed as a High Commission service, with effect from 1st January, 1949. The East African Naval Force was formed on the 1st July, 1950, and was constituted the Royal East African Navy on the 26th May, 1952. In 1950 the Desert Locust Control became a separate service under the High Commission, but it was amalgamated with the Desert Locust Survey on 1st July, 1957. The East African Posts and Telegraphs Department was re-designated the East African Posts and Telecommunications Administration with effect from the 1st October, 1951. The Accountant General's Office was established on the 1st April, 1953.

Under the Order in Council the following services will also be administered by the High Commission upon their formation:

The East African Information Office.
The East African Radio-communications Service.
The East African Regional Geological Survey.
The East African Regional Topographical Survey.

Inter-territorial Services financed, in whole or part, by means of grants made to the High Commission from the East African Regional Allocation under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts.

Such further Research Services as may be set up on an East African basis.

Certain of these services have been re-named so that their designations may correspond more closely with their present functions.

The East Africa Central Legislative Assembly was established by the East Africa (High Commission) Order in Council, 1947, for a period of four years from the 1st January, 1948. The Order in Council has since been amended for the purpose of extending the life of the Assembly, on the last occasion for a period of three years.
from 1st January, 1960. The Assembly held its first meeting in April 1948, and normally holds three meetings in an annual Session.

With effect from the 12th December 1956 membership of the East Africa Central Legislative Assembly was increased from 24 to 34. Hitherto the Assembly consisted of a Speaker, seven ex officio members, three nominated members and 13 unofficial members. There was no change regarding the Speaker and seven ex officio members, but nominated members were increased from three to six and the unofficial members from thirteen to twenty. Two nominated members are appointed by each of the Governors of Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda. Six unofficial members are appointed from each territory, of whom three are appointed in each case by the Governor. In Kenya and Tanganyika these three need not be members of their territorial Legislative Councils, but in Uganda at least two must also be members of the Uganda Legislative Council. The other three from each territory are elected. In Kenya they are elected one from each of the racial groups of European, Asian and African elected members of Legislative Council. In Tanganyika the other three are elected by Representative Members of the Legislative Council from among all members of the Council. The other three from Uganda are elected by the Representative Members of the Legislative Council from among their own number. Two Arab unofficial members are appointed by the East Africa High Commission.

The High Commission has power to legislate, with the advice and consent of the Assembly, in respect of and in connexion with, the inter-territorial services. It also has power to legislate with the advice and consent of the Legislative Councils of the three territories on any matter concerned with the peace, order and good government of the Territories. It has power to appoint such advisory and consultative bodies as it may think fit in respect of any matter which is subject to the control of the High Commission or is of common interest to the territories.

The establishment of the High Commission has involved no change in the constitution or administrative responsibilities of the Governments of the three Territories, which remain responsible for the basic services such as administration, police, health, education, agriculture, animal health, forestry, labour, housing and public works.

The East African Railways and Harbours Administration and the East African Posts and Telecommunications Administration are self-contained and self-financing services. The revenue of the High Commission, from which its other services are financed, is derived from contributions in agreed proportions by the three East African Governments, also by the Government of Zanzibar and certain other Governments for which services are performed, and by Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom which makes substantial contributions to the Research and other Services from the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund. The whole of the expenditure is controlled by the East Africa Central Legislative Assembly.

RESEARCH AND SCIENTIFIC SERVICES

RESEARCH SERVICES

The Research Services administered by the High Commission at present are arranged in the following six principal divisions:

East African Agriculture and Forestry Research Organization incorporating the former East African Agricultural Research Institute at Amani in Tanganyika, and including the East African Herbarium, Nairobi; and attached temporary schemes. The organization is responsible for research on certain aspects of animal industry in addition to agriculture and forestry. The headquarters are at Muguga, within easy reach of Nairobi, and are shared with the East African Veterinary Research Organization.

The East African Veterinary Research Organization is responsible for research on animal diseases and other aspects of animal industry, and for the production of vaccines for certain of these diseases.

The East African Trypanosomiasis Research Organization is responsible for entomological and trypanosomiasis research, animal and human, based on Sukulu in Uganda; the headquarters are at Torooro in Uganda.

The East African Fisheries Research Organization is in two sections, one for the fisheries of inland waters with headquarters at Jinja in Uganda, the other for marine fisheries at Zanzibar—the East African Marine Fisheries Research Organization.

The East African Industrial Research Organization has its headquarters and main laboratory in Nairobi and a Metallurgical Laboratory at Entebbe. The Board is responsible for policy with regard to industrial research.

SCIENTIFIC SERVICES

The Scientific Services include some research among their functions and are as follows:

The East African Statistical Department consists of five units. These are situated in Nairobi, Entebbe and Dar es Salaam. The head of the organization is the Statistical Adviser to the East African Governments and to the High Commission and Director of the Department.

The East African Meteorological Department has its Headquarters and Central Forecasting Organization at Nairobi and maintains Regional Headquarters at Dar es Salaam and Entebbe. It is responsible for the maintenance and study of meteorological records in all parts of East Africa and for weather forecasting, for aviation and other uses.

OFFICE OF THE COMMISSIONER-GENERAL FOR SOUTH-EAST ASIA

COMMISSIONER-GENERAL—The Earl of Selkirk, P.C., O.B.E., A.F.C.*
Deputy Commissioner-General—Sir Denis Allen, K.C.M.G., C.B.

*Lord Selkirk is also United Kingdom Commissioner, Singapore. (See page 56.)

As part of His late Majesty's Government's post-war policy in South-East Asia, a Governor-General was appointed with responsibility for the co-ordination of policy and administration in an area including the Malayan Union, Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo and the Protected State of Brunei. This appointment was announced in Cmd. 6724 in January, 1946, and Mr. Malcolm MacDonald assumed duty as Governor-General in May, 1946. At first his area of authority included only the Malayan Union, Singapore and Brunei, but on the conclusion of negotiations with the Rajah of Sarawak and the British North Borneo Chartered Company, it was extended to the new Colonies of Sarawak and North Borneo. The Governor-General had co-ordinating, but no direct administrative, functions and power to convene conferences of Governors. In respect of Brunei the Governor-General acted as the channel of communication between the Secretary of State and the Resident. In defence matters, the Governor-General was chairman of the British Defence Co-ordination Committee, Far East, on which sat the Commanders-in-Chief of the Services and the Special Commissioner (see below), and on which the Governor-General represented the interests of the territories in his area of authority and also those of Hong Kong.

In 1946 a Special Commissioner (Lord Killearn) responsible to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, had been appointed with Headquarters in Singapore, charged with the responsibility for advising His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom on general problems affecting the conduct of foreign affairs in an area which included Burma, Siam, Indo-China and the then Netherlands East Indies, and with the special duty of improving the production and distribution of food supplies in the area.

Towards the end of 1947, His Majesty's Government came to the decision that, without diminishing in any way the scope of the two organizations, it would be possible to place them under one head, and to combine to a certain extent their clerical and administrative staffs. Accordingly, on Lord Killearn's retirement, the supervision of the two organizations was entrusted on 1st May, 1948, to Mr. Malcolm MacDonald with the title of "Commissioner-General for the United Kingdom in South-East Asia". On the same date the Commissioner-General's direct administrative responsibilities in respect of Brunei lapsed when the Governor of Sarawak was appointed High Commissioner for Brunei; his other responsibilities in respect of Brunei remain. Mr. MacDonald was succeeded in September, 1955, by Sir Robert Scott.

On the attainment of full independence within the Commonwealth by the Federation of Malaya on 31st August 1957, a High Commissioner for the United Kingdom was appointed in Kuala Lumpur and the Commissioner-General's responsibilities in relation to the Federation became similar to those exercised in relation to the other independent countries in the area.

The Commissioner-General's organization, with its headquarters in Singapore, was reorganized during 1956 as a United Kingdom Office, staffed by United Kingdom-based officers and paid for by United Kingdom funds.

On the attainment of full internal self-government by the State of Singapore, it was agreed that the responsibilities of the Commissioner-General should in future be discharged by the person appointed under the Singapore constitution to be the representative of the United Kingdom Government in Singapore, and in October 1959 the appointment of Lord Selkirk to this joint office was announced. The United Kingdom Commissioner in his responsibilities for South-East Asia is instructed to advise Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom on the general conduct of British policy in South-East Asia. In addition, he is the United Kingdom Council Representative in the South-East Asia Treaty Organization (Headquarters in Bangkok), and Chairman of the British Defence Co-ordination Committee (Far East) dealing with defence policy in the area.

WEST AFRICAN RESEARCH OFFICE

As the outcome of a meeting held in Lagos in January 1958, the Governments of Ghana, the Federation of Nigeria, Sierra Leone and the Gambia decided to replace the West African Inter-Territorial Secretariat and the West African Standing Advisory Committee for Agricultural Research by a new organization, to be known as the West African Research Office, with the functions of co-ordinating and administering scientific research conducted jointly by the four Governments. The new office is in Accra, Ghana (P.O. Box 1117), but is expected to transfer to Lagos, Nigeria, during the course of the year.

Administrator—L. G. Heptinstall (Acting).

INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION

THE UNITED NATIONS

Her Majesty's Government is constitutionally responsible for the conduct of the international relations of Colonial territories and accordingly the interests of the Colonies are represented by the United Kingdom at the United Nations. Her Majesty's Government consults Colonial Governments before acceding on their behalf to international agreements which affect them.

In some of the Specialized Agencies, namely the International Telecommunications Union, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the Inter-governmental Maritime Consultative Organization, Colonial Governments can be separately represented as associate members. In the Universal Postal Union they have combined representation through a Colonial Ensemble. In the International Telecommunications Union Colonies which are not associate members are similarly represented through a Colonial Ensemble. Some Colonies, or groups of Colonies, are separate members of the World Meteorological Organization.

The Singapore and British Borneo group (consisting of Singapore, North Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei) and Hong Kong are associate members of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East.

An Economic Commission for Africa was set up in 1958 and held its first meeting at Addis Ababa in December 1958. The Federation of Nigeria, Sierra Leone, the Gambia, Kenya and Zanzibar (together), Uganda, Tanganyika and the Somaliland Protectorate are associate members.

Apart from the participation of Colonies directly in the work of those of the Specialized Agencies which permit it, Her Majesty's Government also, when appropriate, includes Colonial Representatives in United Kingdom delegations.

In their administration of the Trust Territories of the British Cameroons and Tanganyika, Her Majesty's Government collaborates with the General Assembly of the United Nations and the Trusteeship Council in accordance with the United Nations Charter and the respective Trusteeship Agreements. The United Kingdom Permanent Representative on the Trusteeship Council and in the Fourth Committee of the General Assembly is Sir Andrew Cohen, K.C.M.G., K.C.V.O., O.B.E. He is assisted by the First Secretary (Colonial Affairs) in the United Kingdom Mission to the United Nations, Mr. G. K. Caston.

AFRICA

The Commission for Technical Co-operation in Africa South of the Sahara (C.C.T.A.) has been in existence since 1950. The Agreement formally establishing the Commission was signed in 1954 by the Governments of Belgium, France, Portugal, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, the Union of South Africa and the United Kingdom. There is provision in the Agreement for the admission of other countries within the geographical scope of the Commission; Ghana and Liberia were so admitted to membership in 1957 and Guinea in 1959.

C.C.T.A. organizes in Africa regular technical conferences, which are attended by representatives of the territories of the Member Governments, and to which observers from non-member
Governments in the region and from other international organizations may be invited. It supervises the activities of a number of technical bureaux and the execution of special research projects. It has also created a number of advisory committees and panels of correspondents. Amongst the subjects dealt with are agriculture, forestry, animal diseases, social services, social sciences, medicine, labour, housing and statistics.

The Commission is advised in scientific matters by the Scientific Council for Africa (C.S.A.), which itself organizes frequent meetings of specialists.

C.C.T.A. co-operates with other international organizations including the Specialized Agencies of the United Nations.

In February 1958 the Foundation for Mutual Assistance in Africa South of the Sahara was inaugurated under the auspices of C.C.T.A. Its function is to promote technical assistance by providing experts, instructors or advisers, by training personnel and by supplying equipment for training and research.

The headquarters of the Commission and the Foundation are to be transferred during 1960 from London to Lagos, Nigeria; there is also an office of the Joint Secretariat of C.C.T.A./C.S.A. at Bukavu in the Belgian Congo.

CARIBBEAN

The Caribbean Commission was set up in 1946, and has its headquarters in Trinidad. It is a joint body representative of the Governments of France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States, for the purpose of encouraging and strengthening social and economic co-operation between the Caribbean territories for which those Governments have responsibilities, and co-ordinating research in these fields. (See Cmd. 8575, paragraphs 336-344.) The United Kingdom co-Chairman is Mr. I. P. Garran, C.M.G., Minister (Commercial) at the British Embassy, Washington.

SOUTH PACIFIC

A regional Commission for the South Pacific was established in 1947 (Cmd. 8539) by agreement between the Governments of Australia, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. It is a consultative and advisory body to the participating Governments in matters affecting the economic and social development of non-self-governing territories in the South Pacific region. Annual sessions of the Commission are held at its headquarters in Noumea, New Caledonia, and it is assisted, in framing its work programme, by annual meetings of a Research Council and triennial meetings of a Conference of territorial delegates. The Commission's organization was reviewed at an inter-Governmental conference in 1957.

The United Kingdom Senior Commissioner is Sir Kenneth Maddocks, Governor of Fiji, and the Secretary-General, Mr. T. R. Smith, Noumea, New Caledonia.

SOUTH-EAST ASIA

Singapore, North Borneo and Sarawak participated in the preparation of the Colombo Plan for Co-operative Economic Development in South and South-East Asia, and are eligible for assistance under the technical co-operation scheme. The scheme is designed to provide participating countries with technical assistance in the form of training facilities and the services of experts.
