BERMUDA

Situation and Area

The "Bermudas" or "Somers Islands" are situated in the Western Atlantic Ocean, about 570 miles east of Cape Hatteras in North Carolina, and until 1940 had an area of 19·34 square miles. As a result of work done by the United States authorities since 1940 to unite and extend some of the islands with materials dredged from the sea, their total area is now 20·59 square miles, of which 2·30 square miles are leased to the Government of the United States for naval and military bases, leaving 18·29 square miles available to the civil population. The United States Bases include a large airfield which is used by both military and commercial traffic.

Population

The estimated civil population on the 31st December, 1958 was 43,480, of whom 16,037 were white and 27,443 coloured.

Principal Towns

The City of Hamilton, the capital since 1815, with a population estimated at about 3,000, is situated on the main island. The town of St. George on the island of St. George was formerly the capital of the Colony. Its population is estimated at about 1,500.

Geographical Features

The Bermudas consist of about 300 coralstone islands and islets, roughly in the form of a fishhook, along the southern rim of the oval plateau summit, about 22 miles from east to west and 14 miles from north to south, of a steep submarine volcanic mountain which is reputed to be between 14,000 and 15,000 feet in height. The ten principal islands are connected by bridges and form a chain about 22 miles long between its north-east and south-west extremities. These islands vary in width but the main island, which is about 14 miles long, has an average width of about 1 mile; it contains about 9,000 acres of land, the highest point being only 259·4 feet above the sea. All the other islands and the areas reclaimed for the United States Bases aggregate about 4,240 acres.

Climate

The climate is generally mild and humid with a mean annual temperature of 70° F. and average annual maximum and minimum temperatures of 90° F. and 47° F. respectively. The coldest and hottest months are February and August with mean temperatures of 62° F. and 80° F. respectively. The average annual rainfall is 58·1 inches. The climate shows very little variation throughout the Colony.

History

According to a 17th century French cartographer the islands were probably discovered in 1503 by a Spanish mariner, Juan Bermudez, but the Spaniards took no steps to form a settlement and the islands were still entirely uninhabited when in 1609 Admiral Sir George Somers ship The Sea Venture was wrecked upon one of the sunken reefs while conveying a party of colonists to Virginia. The reports of the beauty and fertility of the land induced the Virginia Company to seek an extension of their charter so as to include the islands within their dominion, and this extension was granted by King James I, in 1612 and the first emigrants went out in that year. Shortly afterwards the Virginia Company sold the islands for the sum of £2,000 to a new body of adventurers called "The Governor and Company of the City of London for the Plantation of the Somers Islands", and thenceforward for a considerable time the islands bore that name. In 1684 the charter of the Bermuda Company of London was annulled and government passed to the Crown.

Constitution

Representative government was introduced into the Colony in 1620. Since 1684 the Governors have been appointed by the Crown and the laws of the Colony have been enacted by a local legislature. Until 1888 this legislature consisted of the Governor and the House of Assembly and since then of the Governor, the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly.

The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council consisting of three official and five unofficial members. The Legislative Council consists of eleven members, three of whom are official and eight unofficial. The House of Assembly consists of 36 members, four of whom are elected by each of the nine parishes. There are 7,245 electors, the elector's qualification being the possession of freehold property of not less than £60 value. The qualification for a member of the House of Assembly is the possession of freehold property valued at £240.

With the enactment of the Women's Suffrage Act, 1944, women with the necessary property qualification are entitled to vote and to be elected to the Legislature.

Taxation

There is no direct taxation. The revenue of the Colony is mostly raised from Customs duties. The revenue of the corporation of Hamilton is derived from wharfage, shed tax, rents and local taxation assessed at the rate of 13s. 6d. on every £100 of real estate and personal property, plus 1s. 6d. on every £100 for those freeholders receiving sewerage service. The corporation of St. George's obtains its revenue in like manner, the rates being 13s. 6d. on each £100. The nine parishes, which administer the general parochial affairs of the poor law, levy rates, and under the Liquor Licence Act licensees pay a certain sum which varies according to the class of licence held.

Currency

The coins in circulation are British currency, which is legal tender. There is no limit to the legal tender of British silver. Bermuda Government £5, £1, 10s. and 5s. currency notes to the value of £1,229,396, were in circulation on 31st December, 1958.

Development

During 1958, 13,890 more dead cedar trees were felled and removed and more than 8,000 plants were substituted for them by the Department of Agriculture. This completed the reafforestation of most Government land on Ireland Island and much of the Prospect area. In 1959 the Department's Parks Division continued its excellent work of clearing, developing, landscaping and generally beautifying the many hitherto neglected areas, however small, throughout the islands, thereby greatly enhancing the appearance of the Colony. The Department in collaboration with the Commonwealth Institute of Biological Control continued its unremitting efforts to cope with the several pests which seriously menace so much of the vegetation of Bermuda, the climate of which favours the propagation of such pests.

After seeking a satisfactory marketing scheme, the Bermuda Citrus Growers Association recommended that all citrus fruit be marketed co-operatively through the Government Wholesale marketing Centre. The Department of Agriculture proposed, and several growers agreed, that all fruit offered to the Centre be graded into four sizes for grapefruit, five for oranges and two for lemons, also that seeded, seedless, pink and white fleshed grapefruit be in separate categories.

Throughout 1958, and since, the Department of Public Works was handicapped, as were private contractors, by over-employment and consequent shortage of labour. It succeeded, nevertheless, in dealing with a wide variety of improvements and repairs to, as well as maintenance of, bridges, buildings and roads, as well as with plans for the future. A million gallon rainwater storage tank is being constructed at Prospect and an imposing new City Hall, being built by the Corporation, is approaching completion in the centre of Hamilton.

The Government stone quarry on Castle Harbour appears likely to become a problem in the foreseeable future. Opened some thirty-five years ago, it has yielded nearly one million tons of aggregate for roads and construction work, and is estimated to contain sufficient material for another ten years, if blasting operations continue to be permitted. As, however, no alternative source of supply is known in Bermuda, stone will presumably have to be imported at greatly increased cost when the present quarry is exhausted.

Note.—The number of courses rather than the number of institutions is given, as one institution may provide more than one type of course.

During 1958 the enrolment at St. George's Secondary Modern School was 170 pupils and that at the Prospect Secondary School for Girls 218.

Government expenditure on education in 1958 was £498,203, compared with £40,090 in 1938.

Libraries, Museums, etc.

The Bermuda Library, with adult, children's and music departments in Hamilton, was greatly enlarged during 1957 and now accommodates the interesting collection of the Bermuda Historical Society. It has a branch in St. George and a distribution service to the schools of the Colony.

The Bermuda Government Aquarium with adjoining live zoological collection, which was also considerably enlarged and much improved, has a museum of local natural history and other exhibits. The Bermuda Historical Society has a second museum in St. George containing items of local historical interest.

Health

The level of health in the Colony continued to be high and Government services are chiefly engaged in preventive measures. The Public Health Department is responsible for the inspection of milk and meat, garbage collection and disposal, rat control, mosquito control, etc. It is also responsible for pre-natal and pre-school health services.

The King Edward VII Memorial Hospital is privately run, but receives an annual Government grant-in-aid, amounting in 1959 to £132,000. The Mental Hospital is attended by Government Medical Officers and Health Officers. There is no public hospital or Government medical scheme.

During 1958 total government expenditure on Health Services was £376,271 compared with approximately £41,000 in 1937.

| Year | Visitors |
|------|----------|
| 1953 | 86,110   |
| 1954 | 89,071   |

The majority of these visitors are Americans. In 1958 6,354 came from Canada and 2,472 from the West Indies. Most visitors arrive and leave by air.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The only marketing scheme in operation in Bermuda is the "Planned Production and Marketing Scheme" introduced in 1949 to assist the growers of vegetables to find a suitable outlet for their produce. The growers taking part in the scheme contract to grow a specified acreage of certain vegetable crops. The Department of Agriculture agrees to purchase any produce from the acreage specified at guaranteed minimum prices. In addition to the produce grown on contract the Government Wholesale Agricultural Marketing Centre buys other vegetables, citrus fruit and bananas. This scheme has undoubtedly assisted the farming community as more farmers are applying to join. During 1958 purchases of agricultural produce at the Wholesale Marketing Centre amounted to £49,000. Receipts from the resale of this produce were nearly £47,700.
