FEDERATION OF NIGERIA

Area
The total area is 373,250 square miles (including 34,081 in the Cameroons Trust Territory). The country is divided into the Northern, Eastern and Western Regions, the Southern Cameroons and the Federal territory of Lagos. The northern portion of the Cameroons Trust Territory is administered as part of the Northern Region. The areas are:

| Region               | Square miles |
|----------------------|--------------|
| Northern Region      | 281,782      |
| Western Region       | 45,376       |
| Eastern Region       | 29,484       |
| Southern Cameroons   | 16,581       |
| Lagos                | 27           |

Population
Estimated total population in mid-1959 was about 35,284,000.

A census of the country was carried out in three stages: the Northern Region in July 1952, the Western Region (including Lagos) in December 1952 and the Eastern Region (including the Southern Cameroons) in June 1953. The population based on this census, amounted to 31,171,000 distributed as follows:

| Region               | Population   |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Northern Region      | 16,840,000  |
| Eastern Region       | 7,218,000   |
| Western Region       | 6,088,000   |
| Southern Cameroons   | 753,000     |
| Lagos                | 272,000     |

The total non-African population is approximately 27,000.

The main tribal groups are:

- Fulani: 3,023,000
- Hausa: 5,488,000
- Yoruba: 4,508,000
- Ibo: 4,944,000

These are the known figures for each group within the Region it mainly inhabits and exclude minorities living in other Regions. Population is densest between Lagos and Ibadan in the West, around Kano in the North and in the area between Port Harcourt and Onitsha in the East.

Principal Towns
Lagos is the Federal capital. Its population was estimated to be 350,000 in mid-1959. The Regional capitals are Kaduna (Northern), Ibadan (Western), and Enugu (Eastern) with populations of approximately 51,000, 500,000 and 63,000 respectively.

The headquarters of the Southern Cameroons is at Buea. The approximate populations of other towns with more than 50,000 inhabitants are:

**Northern Region**
- Kano: 130,000
- Yerwa/Maiduguri: 57,000
- Zaria: 54,000

**Western Region**
- Ogobomosho: 140,000
- Oshogbo: 123,000
- Ife: 111,000
- Iwo: 100,000
- Abeokuta: 84,000
- Illesha: 72,000
- Oyo: 72,000
- Benin: 54,000

**Eastern Region**
- Onitsha: 77,000
- Port Harcourt: 72,000
- Enugu: 63,000
- Aba: 58,000

Geographical Features
There are four main zones, each stretching across the country from east to west and corresponding closely to the annual rainfall. This falls from as much as 200 inches in the south-east to
as little as 20 inches in the north. The four zones are:

(i) A belt of creeks and mangrove swamps along the coast, which includes the Niger delta.

(ii) A well-watered belt of dense tropical forest stretching inland from the coast from 50 to 100 miles. It is rich in oil palms and cacao.

(iii) A belt of park-like land with savannahs of high grass.

(iv) A vast undulating plateau about 2,000 feet high, with occasional hills of granite and sandstone sometimes rising to over 5,000 feet. The northern half of this is free of tsetse fly, and carries a heavy stock of nomadic cattle. This area also produces groundnuts and cotton.

The Cameroons Mountain (13,350 ft.) is a volcano, which shows intermittent signs of being active. There are 2,600 square miles of land over 5,000 feet and 193,000 square miles over 1,000 feet. The main rivers (with length in Nigeria) are as follows: Niger, 730 miles; Benue, 495 miles; Sokoto, 390 miles; Kaduna, 340 miles; Cross, 335 miles and Dongola, 330 miles.

Lake Chad, the only important lake, has an area of 1,850 square miles. There are 119,431 square miles of forest (constituting 31·9% of the total area of the country).

Climate

There is a dry season, roughly from November to April and a rainy season, which is longer in the south than the north and later in the east than the west. The wettest months in the north are August and September and in the south, June, July and August. Average annual rainfalls are:—Kaduna, 2,000 feet above sea level, 52 inches; Enugu, 600 feet above sea level, 71 inches; Ibadan, 600 feet above sea level, 48 inches. The annual average temperature is everywhere about 80°. In the south the temperature varies very little; in the north it may rise as high as 110° but the nights are cool.

History

As far back as the seventeenth century British traders had mercantile depots on the mouths of the Niger and adjacent rivers and creeks, trade until the nineteenth century being mainly in slaves. Journeys were not undertaken into the interior, however, until the era of exploration which began with the formation in London of an African Association in 1788. The Association directed its attention to solving the mystery of the "Great River" which was known to flow through much of West Africa. Thanks to the journeys of Mungo Park, Hugh Clapperton and the Lander brothers, it was demonstrated in 1830 that the many rivers flowing into the Bight of Benin were, in fact, the delta of the Niger.

Under the inspiration of MacGregor Laird and others, efforts then began to use the Niger as a commercial highway into the interior. They were not on the whole successful, but British and other firms maintained stations in the delta chiefly to trade for palm oil. The energy and vision of Sir George Goldie led to an amalgamation of the British firms into a single company, and the new company developed its trade to such effect that opposing interests were all bought out. At the Berlin conference in 1885 the British claim to a sphere of influence over the Niger districts was accordingly recognized.

The British company, now given a charter and re-named the Royal Niger Company, proceeded to extend its influence into the interior by treaties with local rulers. There was friction with French interests but in 1898 the British and French Governments signed a convention regulating boundaries. In 1900 the administrative rights and powers of the Royal Niger Company were taken over by the Crown.

Until 1914 the country was administered in two parts—the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria and the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria. The Colony comprised a small area around Lagos which had been annexed in 1862 as a base for operations against the slave trade. From 1900 to 1903 the authorities in Northern Nigeria were engaged in bringing under control the powerful emirates of the Hausa states and the Kanuri kingdom of Bornu which maintained large standing armies used for slave raiding.

In 1914 Northern and Southern Nigeria were amalgamated to form a Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. At the end of the 1914–18 war part of the adjacent territory of the German Cameroons (which had been occupied by Anglo-French forces) was placed by the League of Nations under British Mandate and has since been administered as part of Nigeria. Following the formation of the United Nations the Cameroons became a Trusteeship Territory.

Constitution, 1914–1951

The administration of the amalgamated territory was in the hands of the Nigerian Council, set up in 1914 and existing alongside the old Lagos Executive Council which had first been created in 1862 to administer Lagos affairs. The Council had six African members and 30 European members and was without legislative or executive authority. The Governor was not bound to give effect to any resolution of the Council unless he should think fit to do so.

In 1922 a new constitution was introduced providing for a Legislative Council of 46 members of whom ten were Africans, four of them elected (three for Lagos and one for Calabar). The Council was empowered to legislate for the Colony and the Southern Provinces of Nigeria, while the Governor continued to legislate by proclamation for the Northern Provinces. In 1923 an Order in Council made provision for the trusteeship territory of the Southern Cameroons to be administered as part of the Southern Provinces, while the Northern sections were attached for administrative purposes to the adjacent provinces of the North.

No further changes were made until 1947 when the "Richards Constitution" was introduced (so-called after Sir Arthur Richards, then Governor). The objects of the 1946 Constitution were (i) to promote the future unity of the country; (ii) to express its diversity; and (iii) to increase the discussion and management by Nigerians of their own affairs. A Legislative Council was set up for the whole of Nigeria with 45 members, of whom 28 were Africans (four elected and 24 nominated) while the Executive Council was still mainly composed of official members. But the biggest change brought about by the 1946 Constitution was the setting up of Regional Houses of Assembly in Eastern, Western and Northern Nigeria with a House of Chiefs for the Northern Region. These Assemblies were created for the purpose of linking the Central Legislative Council and the Native Authorities and to consider and advise by resolution on any matters referred to them by the Governor. Executive functions were not provided for but estimates of annual and supplementary expenditure and bills whose terms were
applicable to a region were placed before the Houses of Assembly. Their recommendations were considered by the Governor-in-Council and placed before the Central Legislative Council.

The importance and uniqueness of the Richards Constitution was its introduction of the policy of regionalization which has since been developed in successive constitutions. Provision was included in the constitution for its operation to be reviewed after three-year and six-year periods and to be revised after nine years; but as early as 1948 the new Governor, Sir John Macpherson, reported that he was so encouraged by the working of the constitution that he considered that changes should be made at the beginning of the second three-year period. In fact deliberations extended over a two-year period and it was not until January 1951 that a new constitution was formally introduced.

The 1951 Constitution provided for a Council of Ministers of 18 members (12 Africans and 6 officials), a House of Representatives of 142 members (136 Africans and 6 officials) and for a House of Assembly in each of the three Regions and a House of Chiefs in Northern and Western Nigeria. Apart from the official members, members of the Houses of Assembly were elected through electoral colleges and members of the House of Representatives were elected by each Regional House of Assembly on the basis of 34 members each from Eastern and Western Nigeria and 68 from Northern Nigeria. Increased powers were given to the Regional Houses to make laws covering a restricted range of subjects, mainly concerned with local social services, local courts and local taxation, subject to reference to the Governor-in-Council. Nominations to the Central Council of Ministers were subject to approval by a joint council of the Regional Houses in North and West and to a session of the House of Assembly in the East. There was equal representation for each Region in the Council of Ministers.

Throughout its life of 27 months the 1951 Constitution was subject to stresses and strains and in March 1953 a crisis developed which made it clear that further constitutional revision had become necessary.

Constitutional Conferences of 1953 and 1954—Federation

In August 1953 delegates of all political parties met in London to consider the problems involved in creating a new constitution. They met again in Lagos in January 1954, and on 1st October 1954 a new constitution was brought into operation which recognised to a limited extent the autonomy of Regional Governments for their internal administration and affairs. The 1954 Constitution retained the framework of its predecessor but carried regionalization a stage further by declaring Nigeria a Federation. It was also noteworthy in that it gave responsibilities to Nigerian Ministers for the formation and execution of policy.

At the centre, the House of Representatives was enlarged to 184 directly elected members and the Council of Ministers was composed of ten African Ministers and three ex officio Ministers. In the Eastern and Western Regions all ex officio representation ceased both in the Regional Executive and the Regional House of Assembly. In the Regions the members of the Executive Councils were appointed from the party having a majority in the Regional House of Assembly. At the centre, appointment to the Council of Ministers was on the basis of three members each from Eastern, Northern and Western Nigeria and one member from the Southern Cameroons. Nominations were made by the party having a majority of seats in a Region at the Federal elections. These are separate from and independent of elections to a Regional House of Assembly and no one may serve as a member of both a Regional and the Federal Legislature. At the Federal elections of 1954 the party of the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (N.C.N.C.) won a majority of seats in both Eastern and Western Nigeria and thus obtained the right to nominate six members in all to the Federal Council of Ministers, the composition of which was:

- 6 N.C.N.C.;
- 3 Northern Peoples’ Congress (N.P.C.);
- 1 Kamerun National Congress (K.N.C.).

Constitutional Conference of 1957

The review of the 1954 Constitution, scheduled for 1956, was deferred until May and June 1957. The delegates, who again met in London, pressed for a firm date to be given for the grant of full independence for the Federation, but in view of the many unresolved questions the Secretary of State for the Colonies was unable to give an undertaking to this effect. He did undertake, however, to consider the matter sympathetically after a new Federal House was elected in 1959. In the meantime it was agreed to set up Commissions to inquire into the fears of minorities, the fiscal arrangements for the Federation, and the delimitation of constituencies for a proposed new Federal House of Representatives of 320 members. It was also agreed that the office of Federal Prime Minister should be created, and in August 1957 the first Federal Prime Minister was appointed. Ex officio members disappeared from the Federal Council of Ministers, except for the President (the Governor-General). The Prime Minister formed a coalition Government of the principal parties in the House and the Council was composed of the Governor-General as President, the Prime Minister and ten other Ministers.

The township of Lagos became Federal territory and the trusteeship territory of the Southern Cameroons, although having its own Legislature, was described as quasi-Federal territory.

Internal self-government was granted to the Eastern and Western Regions as a result of decisions taken at the 1957 Conference and to Northern Nigeria on March 15, 1959, following the Conference of 1958. The Premier of each Region now presides over meetings of the Executive Councils. The Governor is required to act on the advice of his Ministers and on their advice to give or withhold assent to all bills passed in the Legislative Houses of the Regions except in three specific cases: a bill appearing to be inconsistent with treaty obligations of the United Kingdom; a bill whereby the Royal Prerogative or the rights of property of Her Majesty’s subjects not residing in Nigeria, or the trade and communications of any part of Her Majesty’s dominions, may be prejudiced; a bill which in the opinion of the Governor might have the effect of impeding or prejudicing the performance by the Federal Government of its functions or of endangering the continuance of federal government in Nigeria.

In the Northern and Western Regions there are two-chamber systems of Government, consisting in each case of a House of Chiefs and a House of Assembly. In the Eastern Region there is a House...
of Assembly only but there is constitutional provision for an Eastern Region House of Chiefs as a second chamber. The Members of the Western House of Assembly are all elected, with the exception of three Special Members who may be appointed by the Governor of the Region. In the Northern Region the Members of the House of Assembly are all elected except for five Special Members who are appointed by the Governor of the Region. Both the House of Chiefs and the House of Assembly are to be enlarged and a Council of Chiefs is to be created.

Constitutional amendments which came into effect on the 1st April 1958 provided for the establishment of a Ministerial form of Government in the Southern Cameroons and on the 15th May 1958 the former Leader of Government Business was appointed Premier. Four Ministers were appointed by the High Commissioner on the Premier's recommendation from among the unofficial majority in the Executive Council. The Governor-General of the Federation, as High Commissioner for the Southern Cameroons, remains responsible for all matters within the competence of the Southern Cameroons Government and the Executive Council is presided over by the Commissioner of the Cameroons, who is responsible to the High Commissioner. The elected membership of the House of Assembly is now 26 following new elections held in January 1959. Provision has also been made for the creation of a House of Chiefs with deliberative powers. The United Kingdom Government will continue to be responsible for the Trust Territory pending the outcome of the plebiscite.

The N.P.C. is the majority party in the Northern House of Assembly, the N.C.N.C. in the Eastern House of Assembly, the Action Group in the Western House of Assembly, and the Kamerun National Democratic Party in the House of Assembly of the Southern Cameroons.

The executive authority of the Federation extends to all matters in respect of which the Federal Legislature has power to make laws. Under the 1954 Constitution (as subsequently modified) certain subjects became exclusively a matter for the Federal Legislature. Such subjects include External Affairs, Aviation, Banks, Census, Customs, Defence, Maritime Shipping, Mines and Minerals, Posts and Telegraphs, Trunk Roads and Railways. In addition there is a Concurrent List of subjects which may be dealt with by the Regional Legislatures as well as by the Federal Legislature, although in the event of inconsistency Federal law prevails. All subjects which are not included in the Federal or Concurrent Lists are matters within the exclusive executive and legislative competence of the Regional Governments.

The 1957 Conference recommended that the Regions should have power to own or participate in Commercial Banks, though the Federal Government would retain its exclusive responsibility for central banking matters and exclusive powers of legislation concerning the supervision of banks and banking.

Resumed Conference of 1958

In September and October 1958 a further meeting of the Constitutional Conference was held in London at which Her Majesty's Government agreed to grant independence to the Federation of Nigeria as from 1st October 1960 if the Federal House of Representatives, elected at the end of 1959, so requests. The Conference was a resumption of the May–June Conference of 1957, called to consider the reports of the Commissions set up as a result of the 1957 Conference and to settle certain other outstanding questions. The Commissions enquired into (i) the fears of minorities in an independent Nigeria; and (ii) the allocation of revenue. All the recommendations of the Fiscal Commission, and most of those of the Minorities Commission, were accepted by the Conference. The resumed Conference of 1958 also reached agreement on many other outstanding problems preparatory to independence. These included the following:

(i) Incorporation of provisions in the constitution to safeguard human rights;

(ii) Preservation of the Police as a unified Force under the Inspector-General, but providing for such measures as recruitment on a regional basis and the creation of a Police Council with Regional Ministerial members responsible (subject to the ultimate authority of the Federal Government) for Police administration;

(iii) Grant of self-government to Northern Nigeria as from 15th March 1959;

(iv) Lagos Federal Boundary to remain unchanged and the Lagos Town Council to take over certain responsibilities at present the concern of the Federal Government;

(v) Composition of the Federal Supreme Court to be enlarged by appointing Regional Chief Justices as ex officio members; certain rights of appeal, on a new basis, to lie from the High Courts to the Federal Supreme Court;

(vi) Except in the United Kingdom there is not to be Regional representation of Nigeria overseas;

(vii) General acceptance of the recommendations of the Minorities Commission in respect of minority areas but provisions and safeguards to be included in the constitution, prescribing the procedure for the creation of new States in an independent Nigeria and for revision of boundaries between Regions;

(viii) No immediate constitutional changes are to be made affecting the Southern Cameroons although the new Government taking office in 1959 will be free to request the implementation of certain agreed measures of constitutional advance; the subsequent position of the territory vis-à-vis the Federation will depend on the wishes of the people.

(ix) Procedure for the amendment of the constitution after independence.

(x) After independence there would be mutual advantage to Britain and Nigeria in co-operation in all fields including defence.

The Constitution was further amended after the 1958 Conference, in November 1958 and March, June, October and November, 1959, to give effect to the Conference's recommendations, including those relating to the police, the appellate jurisdiction of the Courts, changes in the Southern Cameroons constitution as requested by the Southern Cameroons Government, and provision for safeguarding human rights.

New elections to the Federal House of Representatives were held in December 1959 for 312 seats, the Southern Cameroons not taking part. Elections were by adult suffrage in all parts of the Federation except Northern Nigeria where there is male adult suffrage.

As a result of the election the N.P.C. obtained a majority of seats in the new House and the outgoing Prime Minister was invited to form a
Government. A coalition of the N.P.C. and N.C.N.C. has been formed and the Action Group forms the Opposition.

The new Federal Legislature also includes an Upper House or Senate consisting of twelve members from each Region, four members from Lagos, four Special members and those members of the Council of Ministers who are members of the House of Representatives (the latter having no votes in the Senate).

At its first meetings the new House passed a resolution requesting Her Majesty's Government to introduce the necessary legislation to enable Nigeria to become an independent sovereign state with effect from 1st October, 1960.

Elections to the Federal House in the Southern Cameroons have been suspended at the request of the Southern Cameroons legislature, pending the results of a plebiscite to be held before March 1961, to ascertain whether the people of the territory wish to join an independent Nigeria or an independent Cameroons Republic.

At a plebiscite held in the Northern Cameroons Trust Territory on the 7th November 1959, 42,797 voted for the territory to become part of the Northern Region of Nigeria when Nigeria achieved independence and 70,401 voted to defer a decision on the territory's future until a later date.

Military and Naval Forces

On 1st April 1958 control of the Nigerian Military Forces was handed over by the War Office to the Government of the Federation. As the Nigeria Regiment, the Force was formerly part of the Royal West African Frontier Force. It was created the separate military command of the Nigerian Military Forces in 1956 and now consists of five battalions, one field battery, one Field Squadron of Engineers and one Squadron of Signals. Officers and senior N.C.Os. are seconded from the British Army, though there is progressively rapid "Nigerianization" and a number of Nigerian officers have been commissioned. The Regiment has seen service in both World Wars and has a distinguished list of Battle Honours in East Africa and Burma. On the occasion of the Royal Visit to Nigeria in January 1956, Her Majesty the Queen conferred on the Regiment the title of the "Queen's Own Nigeria Regiment".

In 1956 approval was given for the establishment of a Naval Force and on 1st May 1958 the Nigerian Naval Force was formally created with headquarters aboard H.M.N.S. Quorra at Lagos.

Both the Military and Naval Forces have been granted the prefix "Royal".

Land Policy

Outside Lagos and the Colony Province of Western Nigeria, land may not be alienated to non-natives without the consent of the Regional Government. In Eastern and Western Nigeria approval may be given for a lease of up to 99 years. In Northern Nigeria right of occupancy in trading areas may be granted by the Governor to non-natives for periods up to 40 years. In general, rights of occupancy are extended for further periods on the expiry of the first term. In the Federal territory of Lagos and the Colony Province of Western Nigeria there is no Government control over land transactions and any person or any company incorporated or registered in Nigeria may acquire property by agreement with the owners. In the Southern Cameroons the same regulations apply as in Northern Nigeria except that grant of occupancy is in the pleasure of the Governor-General.

Taxation

The taxation of non-natives throughout Nigeria, and of natives in the township of Lagos, is governed by the Income Tax Ordinance, which levies a graduated income tax ranging from 4½d. in every £ of the first £200 of taxable income to 15s. in the £ for every £ exceeding £10,000. There are special rates for incomes which do not exceed £150. Companies pay a flat rate of 8s. in the £. In 1948 an arrangement was concluded with the United Kingdom Government for the avoidance of double taxation.

The taxation of natives outside the township of Lagos is a matter for the Regional Governments and the Government of the Southern Cameroons. In the Northern and Western Regions and in the Southern Cameroons the Direct Taxation Ordinance provides for the payment of a tax assessed in a variety of ways from the individual assessment of wealthy traders in large towns to a flat rate in backward areas. A graduated form of income tax is in force throughout the Eastern Region by the Eastern Region Finance Law, 1956.

The resumed Constitutional Conference of 1958 agreed that, as recommended by the Fiscal Commission, Income Tax on non-natives should in future be levied by the Regional Governments in whose Areas such non-natives are resident.

The principal forms of indirect taxation are import, export and excise duties.

(Federal expenditure includes statutory appropriations to Regional Governments.)

Sterling assets in London were valued at £211 millions at 31st March 1959.
The Public Debt of both the Federal and Regional Governments at 31st December 1958 totalled £47·99 millions, of which £19·65 millions consisted of external loans (including £2·8 millions of the £10 million loan negotiated with the International Bank) and £28·34 million internal loans. In addition there were external loans of £1·26 millions outstanding to statutory authorities and guaranteed by Governments. In May 1959 the Federal Government launched three internal loans totalling £2 millions. Applications for the stock totalled £2,856,220. The United Kingdom Government agreed in July 1959 to make available by way of loan £15 millions (comprising £12 millions Commonwealth Assistance Loan and £3 millions Exchequer Loan) towards the Nigerian Governments' development programmes.

Currency

The currency in circulation is issued by the West African Currency Board in London and the Central Bank of Nigeria. It consists of notes of 100s., 20s., 10s. and 5s.; alloy coins of 2s., 1s. and 6d.; nickel coins of 3d.; bronze coins of 1d., ¼d. and tenth penny. Nickel coins of 1d., ¼d. and tenth penny continue to circulate but are withdrawn on presentation to banks. The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par. The Central Bank of Nigeria was opened on 1st July 1959 and now issues a Nigerian currency which will eventually replace entirely the currency of the West African Currency Board.

Development Plans

Nigeria has received a total allocation of £13,530,000 for the period 1955-60 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1955. This sum, which is additional to the unspent balance of the allocations made in respect of the period 1951-56, and includes a supplementary allocation of £450,000 made to the Southern Cameroons in 1957, is divided as follows:

| Region                  | Amount (£) |
|-------------------------|------------|
| Federal Government      | 3,750,000  |
| Northern Region         | 4,750,000  |
| Eastern Region          | 2,750,000  |
| Western Region          | 500,000    |
| Southern Cameroons      | 1,780,000  |

In addition, direct grants made under the Higher Education allocation of the 1955 Act include £300,000 to the Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology and £150,000 to the University College, Ibadan. A further £250,000 has been made available for the Southern Cameroons. It has been agreed that grants will be made to Governments of any unspent balances of existing schemes at the date of independence.

Soon after the war the Government of Nigeria embarked on a Ten-Year Plan of Development and Welfare which came to an end on 31st March 1956. Capital expenditure of approximately £60 millions was incurred on projects which now fall within the competence of the Federal Government. These include all forms of national communications, provision of loan capital to statutory corporations and grants to the institutes of higher education (University College, University College Teaching Hospital and the Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology). Towards the end of this period Government invited the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development to carry out an appraisal of the economic prospects of the territory and to recommend practical measures for their realization. The Mission's report was published in September 1954, under the title of "The Economic Development of Nigeria", which has been described as "the first attempt at a plan for Nigeria sufficiently broad to review not only the services of Government, but also to take into account all the resources which are likely to be available." The Mission's proposals form the broad basis of the Federal and Regional Government's development plans which have since been introduced.

In March 1956 the Federal House of Representatives approved a Government White Paper (Sessional Paper No. 2, 1956) for An Economic Programme of the Government of the Federation of Nigeria which called for capital expenditure of £91,336,000 over the five-year period 1955-1960. Several projects included in the programme had been started under an Interim Development Plan approved in 1955 and these were incorporated into the comprehensive scheme.

In 1958 the Economic Programme was re-examined in the light of progress reports which showed that the rate of implementation of the Programme was slower than planned. In the Second Progress Report on the Economic Programme (Sessional Paper No. 1, 1958) it was announced that the programme would be extended to 31st March 1962 and that the original estimated cost would be revised to £114,006,480 to cover the increased costs of projects already provided for and certain new schemes and projects which have now become necessary.

Of the total, £78,146,480 is capital expenditure on Government account, £32,860,000 is for capital expenditure loans to statutory corporations and £3 millions have been allowed as a margin for increased costs. A further £2 millions, additional to the above figures, are provisionally estimated to cover costs of new projects the need of which has not yet appeared. Government capital expenditure includes £21·5 millions on Posts and Telegraphs, and £25·8 millions on Public Works the main item of which is highways and bridges at an estimated cost of £20·3 millions. The Nigerian Railway Corporation is to receive £19·5 millions under the Capital Loans Account. About half of this was made available through a loan from the World Bank of £28 millions in 1958 for the purpose of starting work on a 400-mile railway extension in North-East Nigeria. Other large amounts are earmarked for Ports and Inland Waterways (£9·8 millions), Electricity (£8·6 millions), Education (£5·6 millions) and Medical Services (£1·5 millions). The programme includes expenditure on aviation, broadcasting, Lagos Town Planning, surveys, meteorology, natural resources, industry, defence and the building and setting up of a State Bank. Up to 31st March 1960 it is estimated that capital expenditure on Government account will reach £37,343,000. A further Progress Report (March 1959) shows that the expenditure is now estimated at £120,723,050.

The Northern Regional Government has estimated that the total revenue available from all sources to meet recurrent and capital expenditure in the Region over the period 1955-60 will be approximately £89,000,000. Of this about £15·3 millions is for expenditure on non-development projects. In the light of this estimate a development programme has been framed, details of which are contained in a White Paper entitled "A Statement of Policy on the Development Finance Programme of the Northern Region..."
of Nigeria, 1955–60”. The programme includes the following major items:

| Item                                      | £       |
|-------------------------------------------|---------|
| Public Works                              | 19,500,000 |
| Education, general and technical          | 17,000,000 |
| Roads, construction and improvement      | 10,000,000 |
| Agriculture                               | 9,700,000 |
| Medical and Health                        | 9,585,000 |
| Water Supplies, rural and urban           | 4,500,000 |
| Veterinary                                | 2,000,000 |
| Other Provision                           | 6,900,000 |

Native Authorities will spend an estimated £16.6 millions on development projects.

In 1959 the Government of the Eastern Region published its Development Plans as Eastern Region Official Document No. 2 of 1959, covering the period from 1958 to 1962. The total capital expenditure detailed in the Programme is £16,640,000 (including provision for a University of Nigeria and financing of the Eastern Region Development Corporation outside the Government budgets). The Programme points out that total expenditure by Government will greatly exceed this amount and is likely to be over £60,000,000 during the four-year period covered taking both capital and recurrent expenditure into account. Under the Development Programme the main heads of expenditure are listed as:

| Item                                      | £       |
|-------------------------------------------|---------|
| Agriculture                               | 790,000 |
| Transport (roads, bridges etc.)            | 3,840,000 |
| Water supplies                            | 2,400,000 |
| Health                                    | 875,000 |
| Education                                 | *4,000,000 |
| Building programme                        | 2,555,000 |

*Includes £3,500,000 for the University of Nigeria.

The Government of the Southern Cameroons has published an “Outline Plan of Development and Welfare, 1955–60” (Sessional Paper No. 2 of 1955), which envisages expenditure of over £1,500,000, including the following main items:

| Item                                      | £       |
|-------------------------------------------|---------|
| Road Development                          | 659,000 |
| Education                                 | 323,000 |
| Agriculture (including Fisheries)         | 230,000 |
| Medical (including Leprosy)               | 145,000 |

The Government of the Western Region has estimated that the total revenue available from all sources to meet all expenditure by the Regional Government over the period 1955–60 will be approximately £104,860,000. Of this it is estimated that about £37,126,000 will constitute Capital Development fund receipts. The following are some of the main items in the overall plan:

| Item                                      | £       |
|-------------------------------------------|---------|
| Education                                 | 34,000,000 |
| Health                                    | 9,900,000 |
| Water Supplies (Rural and Urban)          | 5,060,000 |
| Roads                                     | 4,382,000 |
| Electricity                               | 1,000,000 |

The capital expenditure figure also includes grants amounting to £6,750,000 to the Regional Production Development Board and to the Regional Finance Corporation. Details of the Development Plan are set out in Sessional Paper No. 4 of 1955 entitled “Development of the Western Region of Nigeria, 1955–60”. A new five-year plan of development to cost £165 million has been approved.

On the recommendation of the International Bank Mission, a National Economic Council has been formed in order that the Federal and Regional Governments may meet to discuss the many economic problems common to each, notwithstanding their separate constitutional functions and such of their development policies as may have consequences reaching beyond their respective constitutional spheres.

Other Development

The Production Development Corporations and Boards are devoting large sums of money to the improvement of production methods for both food and export crops which is so essential to the well-being of the country. They include the operation of oil mills in the west and east, the distribution of artificial fertilizers, particularly in the north, a survey of cocoa soils, the establishment of a 20,000 acre cattle ranch in the east and schemes for mechanizing rice cultivation. They are also spending large sums on roads. The Government has also set up a Development Board at Lagos to provide roads and services near Apapa Wharf to which the Colonial Development Corporation is lending £1½ million. The most important industrial plants, other than the Nigerian Tobacco Company at Ibadan and the plywood and veneer factory at Sapele, are the spinning and weaving mills at Kaduna, Kano and Lagos and the ceramic factory at Ikorodu, near Lagos, which supplies a large proportion of domestic pottery requirements, and the cement factory at Nkalagu, in the Eastern Region. The Development Corporations are empowered to make loans for development purposes.

Education

On the 1st October 1954, on the revision of the Constitution, Education became the responsibility of Regional Governments and the Government of the Southern Cameroons, the Federal Government retaining responsibility for education in Lagos and for those institutions of higher learning which have Nigerian significance, such as the University College at Ibadan, the Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology, King’s College and the Man O’War Bay Training Centre.

The number of children in both primary and secondary schools has expanded considerably. Free primary education for children within the 6–12 years age group was introduced in Western Nigeria in January 1955, in the Federal Capital of Lagos from January 1957. A similar scheme introduced in Eastern Nigeria from February 1957 was modified owing to the high cost of operation. In 1958 there were approximately 2,500,000 children attending primary schools throughout the Federation. There were 311 Teacher Training Institutions with provision for the training of 25,000 teachers; 477 secondary schools for about 88,000 pupils, and one Technical Institute and eight Trade Centres for 5,700 apprentices and trainees.

There are over 1,000 Nigerian students at the University College, Ibadan. The University College Teaching Hospital at Ibadan was officially opened at the end of 1957. The three branches of the Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology at Zaria, Ibadan and Enugu have, in the 1959–60 session, a total enrolment of more than 850 students.

In the Eastern Region an enabling measure for the establishment of a University was enacted during 1955 and a White Paper on the project has
been published by the Government of the Eastern Region. A site for the University has been selected at Nsukka.

On the 1st January, 1959 there were approximately 3,585 Government scholars and private students from Nigeria studying in the United Kingdom. In addition there were about 300 Nigerians studying in North America and a few in India and the West Indies.

Libraries, Museums, and Research Institutes

Lagos has a Municipal Library and other libraries are maintained by the Federal and Regional Information Services. Travelling library schemes have also been organized on a regional basis.

There is a National Museum at Lagos with a branch at Jos. Local museums are established at Ife, Oron and Benin. An Antiquities Commission has general control of museums' policy and the designation and preservation of ancient monuments.

The former West African Institute for Social and Economic Research has been reconstituted as a Nigerian Institute attached to University College, Ibadan.

Health

With the introduction of the 1954 Constitution medical and health matters became the responsibility of the Regional Governments and the Government of the Southern Cameroons, the Federal Government retaining responsibility for medical and health matters in Lagos.

The principal diseases are malaria, yellow fever, trypanosomiasis, cerebro-spinal meningitis, pneumonia, smallpox, leprosy, yaws, tuberculosis, dysentery, venereal diseases, intestinal parasites, filariasis, onchocerciasis, elephantiasis and tropical ulcers. Intensive vaccination campaigns are being carried out and considerable progress has been made in the fight against leprosy.

Hospitals number 188 and there are 479 Maternity Centres, 6 Rural Health Centres and over 1,000 Dispensaries. There are approximately 13,000 beds available in hospitals.

Communications

Kano, Lagos and Calabar are international airports and there are 12 other airfields regularly used by the internal services of the W.A.A.C. (Nigeria) Ltd. which took over Nigeria's share of the assets and services formerly maintained by the West African Airways Corporation when the Corporation was wound up in September 1958, following the dissolution of the West African Air Transport Authority. The present Company is owned jointly by the Government of Nigeria (51%), Elder Dempster Lines Ltd. (32½%) and B.O.A.C. (16%). Ten other aerodromes are used for charter flights and a further 23 landing strips are used also by light communications aircraft. The Company also operates services connecting Lagos with the other British West African territories, Dakar, Khartoum and the United Kingdom. The international services of B.O.A.C., Air France, Sabena, Swissair and other airlines connect Nigeria with London, Western Europe, the Union of South Africa and French West and Equatorial Africa. Full meteorological forecasting stations are established at Kano and Lagos under the control of the British West African Meteorological Service with headquarters at Lagos.

The Nigerian Railway, controlled by the Nigerian Railway Corporation, carried 7,015,000 passengers in 1958-59 and 3,097,000 tons of freight. Route mileage totals 1,770 of 3 ft. 6 in. gauge and 133 of 2 ft. 6 in. gauge. Work commenced in 1958 on a 400-mile extension from Kuru (Jos) to Maiduguri. An extensive programme of re-equipping is also in hand which includes the replacement of steam locomotives by diesel engines.

There are more than 37,000 miles of motorable road. Most of the roads have a gravel or earth surface but about 4,000 miles have been tarred.

The main ports are Lagos and Port Harcourt, and there are smaller ports at Calabar, Degema (Abonnema), Burutu, Sapele, Koko, Warri, Victoria and Tiko. Services for passengers and cargo from the United Kingdom are provided by Elder Dempster Lines Limited, which operates a regular fortnightly passenger service, Palm Line, Guinea Gulf Line, the Nigerian National Line and Elders and Fyffes. Cargo services are also operated from Scandinavian ports by Hoegh Line and Scandinavian West Africa Line.

The Nigerian Government maintains a service carrying passengers and coal between Lagos and Port Harcourt while there are other services linking Lagos, Calabar and Victoria provided by Elder Dempster Lines. This company and Palm Line Limited also provide irregular services linking other coastal ports while a Spanish concern links Calabar and Fernando Po.

The river Niger and its chief tributary, the river Benue, are the principal inland water highways. The Niger is navigable for a distance of 537 miles upstream to Jebba and the Benue for 547 miles from Lokoja to Garua in the French Cameroons. Although the Benue and the upper reaches of the Niger are only navigable during a limited season at high water, both rivers provide an important alternative to the Nigerian Railways for the evacuation of produce. In all there are approximately 4,000 miles of navigable inland waterways in Nigeria. Recommendations for the improvement of the navigability of the Niger/Benue system have been accepted by the Federal Government. These include new navigational aids while major proposals have been accepted for a dam to be built across the Niger above Jebba for the purposes of river and flood control and the development of hydro-electric power.

Radio and Television

The Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation took over on 1st April, 1957, the services hitherto maintained by the Nigerian Broadcasting Service.

There are high power transmitters at Lagos (20 kW.), Kaduna (7.5 kW.), Enugu (2.5 kW.), and Ibadan. The total number of wireless owners can best be estimated from imports of sets which, in 1958, totalled 42,520. In addition there are over 50,000 subscribers to the wired broadcasting systems operated by a private firm and official services to some 28 towns throughout the Federation.

At the end of October the Western Region Government inaugurated television broadcasting to schools. The Eastern Region Government is planning a similar scheme and both Governments are considering the establishment of their own broadcasting services.
Principal Occupations

By far the greater part of the working population is employed in agriculture, wage-earning agricultural employment being largely confined to plantations, although there is considerable seasonal wage-earning employment on the cocoa farms of the Western Region.

The following figures show the approximate numbers employed in the principal industries where workers are regularly employed on a wage. The figures do not include the many persons working for small employers:

| Industry                          | Number Employed |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|
| Agriculture and livestock farming| 42,683          |
| Mining and Quarrying             | 53,647          |
| Manufacturing                     | 31,574          |
| Construction                      | 111,208         |
| Electricity, etc.                 | 8,816           |
| Commerce                          | 56,565          |
| Transport, Communications etc.    | 45,032          |
| Services                          | 123,882         |

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are yams, cassava, guinea corn and millet, cocoyams, groundnuts, oil palms, maize, cocoa, rice and cotton.

The cattle population is estimated at over 6,000,000.

Timber products are of three categories: logs, sawn timber and plywood, of which the first is the most important. In 1958 15.3 million cubic feet of logs and 2.2 million cubic feet of sawn timber were exported.

Despite extensive fishing in inland and coastal waters, the supply of fish does not meet the demand. At sea, improved methods of fishing by canoe and motor boat are being developed. Inland reservoirs are being stocked and village fish ponds started.

The chief minerals are tin and columbite, all of which is exported, and coal, which is used almost entirely by the railway. In 1958 tin concentrates production amounted to 8,412 tons and columbite 806 tons; 925,000 tons of coal were produced and 245,000 tons of crude mineral oil were exported. Small quantities of lead, zinc and gold are also produced.

While agricultural activities continue to be the mainstay of economy and occupation, the past few years have seen an accelerated development of secondary industries and the introduction of a limited degree of mechanization to replace hitherto traditional hand processing in the primary industries. Pioneer oil mills throughout the oil palm belt are gradually replacing the old hand production methods. These are supplemented by the thousands of hand presses in use. Groundnut oil is produced in privately-owned and Government-sponsored mills at Kano and machines have been introduced to improve the decortication of groundnuts which have led to a spectacular increase in the quality of Northern Nigerian groundnuts. Soap factories are in operation at Apapa (Lagos), Aba and Kano; breweries at Apapa and Port Harcourt; cigarette factories at Ibadan, Port Harcourt and Zaria; a cement factory at Nkalagu and one under construction at Abeokuta; canning plants at Ibadan and Kano; textile factories at Kaduna, Kano and Lagos; shoe making; rubber processing; furniture making; tyre re-treading; ceramics; plywood and veneer (one of the most modern factories in the world); light engineering; boat building; wrought iron; metal drums and containers; stationery; gramophone records; plastics; body building (lorries); pre-cast concrete materials; bakeries; cosmetics; mineral waters and squashes; dairy produce; vehicle assembly plants. At a "Made in Nigeria" Exhibition held in Lagos in March 1958 over 120 firms exhibited products made in Nigeria.

In 1938, 55% of the total imports came from the United Kingdom, 9% from other Commonwealth countries and 36% from foreign countries. The corresponding figures in 1958 were 43%, 10% and 47%.

In 1938, 50% of exports went to the United Kingdom, 3% to other Commonwealth countries and 47% to foreign countries. The corresponding figures in 1958 were 56%, 2% and 42%.

The chief imports are cotton piece-goods, rayon piece-goods, bags and sacks, salt, beer, tobacco, corrugated iron sheets, machinery, bicycles, motor vehicles, cement, petroleum oils, foodstuffs and a wide range of consumer goods.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

Following recommendations approved at the Constitutional Conferences of 1953 and 1954 each Region, including the Southern Cameroons, has its own Regional Marketing Board for the purchase of all marketing board produce within the regional boundary. These boards have replaced the four original Marketing Boards each of which dealt with one crop or group of crops only. Regional Boards are responsible within their own areas of operation for fixing producer prices, appointment of licensed buying agents and for development and research.

Following a recommendation of the Constitutional Conference of 1957 the Nigeria Central
Marketing Board, set up under the 1954 constitution, was dissolved in 1958 and its place taken by the Nigerian Produce Marketing Company Ltd., registered in Lagos. The Company is the selling organization of the Boards and continues to be responsible for the functions hitherto conducted by the Central Marketing Board for the maintenance of standards of produce and the export, shipment and sale overseas of the produce purchased by the Regional Produce Marketing Boards.

The Produce Marketing Company Ltd. maintains its London Office at 5, Buckingham Gate, London, S.W.I. The Federal Department of Marketing and Exports is the executive of the Company in Lagos but both Western Nigeria and the Southern Cameroons have set up their own executive regional organizations to handle the internal buying and forwarding of produce.

There is an active co-operative movement in the country, principally organized for the benefit of agricultural co-operators and thrift societies. There are Government Departments in the Regions and in Lagos engaged exclusively in providing assistance to these societies.
