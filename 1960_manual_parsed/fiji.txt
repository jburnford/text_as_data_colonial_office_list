FIJI

Area
The aggregate land area is 7,040 square miles,
most of it contained in the two main islands of
Viti Levu (4,011 square miles) and Vanua Levu
(2,137 square miles). About 100 of the total of
300 islands are inhabited. The dependency of
Rotuma (18 square miles) lies some 400 miles to
the north of Fiji.

Population
The population enumerated in the census of
Fiji, 27th September, 1956, was 345,737:
Fijian . . . . . . . . . . . . 148,134
Rotuman . . . . . . . . . . . 4,422
Other Pacific Islanders . . . . . 5,320
Indian . . . . . . . . . . . . 169,403
European . . . . . . . . . . . 6,402
Part-European . . . . . . . . . 7,810
Chinese and Part-Chinese . . . . . 4,155
Others . . . . . . . . . . . . . 91

The population at the end of 1958 was estimated
to be 374,284.

Principal Towns
The principal centres of population are:

| Population |
|------------|
| Suva, the capital city | 37,371 |
| Lautoka, the largest of the sugar mill centres | 7,420 |
| Vatukoula, the site of the gold mining industry | 5,045 |

Geographical Features
The islands comprising the Colony straddle the
180° meridian and lie about 1,200 miles south of the
equator. Most of them are of volcanic origin
but some are of limestone formation. There are
no active volcanoes though hot springs occur in
isolated places. All the larger islands are sur-
rounded by coral reefs. Mountain ranges of
moderate height—the highest peak is 4,341 feet
above sea level—lie athwart the prevailing
easterly trade winds and there is consequently a
marked difference in the heavy forest vegetation
on the windward and the light reeds and grasses
on the leeward slopes of most islands. The
country is well watered and rivers are numerous.
The total forest area is approximately 3,486
square miles, more than half the total land area
of the Colony.

Climate
The climate is oceanic and tempered by cool
east or south-east breezes which blow between
May and October. During the rest of the year
winds are variable and tropical storms, known
locally as hurricanes, may occur. High humidity,
which sometimes reaches saturation point, causes
unpleasant living conditions while it lasts. Rainfall
varies from an annual average of about 120 inches
in Suva to 75 inches on the leeward coast of Viti
Levu. The diurnal range of temperature at
Suva, a few feet above sea level, is about 11°,
but recordings between 60° and 90° are not
unusual.

History
The first navigator to discover islands in the
Fiji archipelago was Tasman in 1643. Cook
charted a small island in 1774 and Wilson dis-
covered others in 1797. Bligh of the Bounty
recorded most of the Group in 1789 during his
memorable voyage in an open boat after being
cast adrift by the mutineers.

Christianity was introduced into Fiji by
Wesleyan missionaries from Tonga in 1835.
Cakobau (or Thakombau), an influential Fijian
chief, offered to cede the sovereignty of the
islands to Great Britain in 1858 in exchange for
support against his rivals and help in meeting his
debts, but the offer was refused. After a further
unsettled period, Cakobau renewed his offer of
cession. The Deed of Cession was signed at
Levuka on the 10th October, 1874. In 1882 the
seat of government was moved to Suva because
of its better harbour and greater facilities for
expansion.

Rotuma was discovered by Captain Edwards in
H.M.S. Pandora in 1791 during his search for the
Bounty mutineers. In the nineteenth century the
principal Rotuman chiefs repeatedly offered to
cede the island to Great Britain, in order to prevent
the continuance of a succession of religious wars.
Rotuma was formally annexed in 1881.

Constitution
The Government of the Colony is provided for
under Letters Patent, 1937 (as subsequently
amended) and Royal Instructions. The Executive
Council, presided over by the Governor, consists
of the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General,
the Financial Secretary, as ex officio members, and
five nominated members, including a European,
a Fijian and an Indian from the unofficial mem-
bers of the Legislative Council. When a vacancy
occurs amongst the three unofficial members of
Legislative Council serving on Executive Council,
the five European, Fijian or Indian unofficial
members of the Legislature, as the case may be,
are invited to nominate one of their number as a
suitable candidate for the vacancy. The Legis-
lative Council is presided over by the Govern-
or (or a Speaker, first appointed in 1956) and consists
of sixteen official members and fifteen unoffi-
cial members, of whom five are Europeans (three
elected and two nominated), five Indians (three elected and two nominated) and five Fijians elected by secret ballot by the Council of Chiefs, itself consisting of elected and nominated members.

A local government system, first established in 1876, and since 1945 known as the Fijian Administration, has jurisdiction over all Fijians in the Colony, a system based on indigenous institutions. At the apex is the Council of Chiefs, presided over by the Secretary for Fijian Affairs. In executive control is the Fijian Affairs Board, consisting of the Secretary for Fijian Affairs as chairman, the five Fijian members of Legislative Council, a Legal Adviser, and a Financial Adviser. The Secretary for Fijian Affairs is the executive officer of the Board and he is assisted, in each of the three administrative divisions into which the Colony is divided, by a Commissioner, who is in charge of the division and responsible to the Governor, through the Colonial Secretary, for the efficient administration of his division, including Fijian affairs. District Officers act as inspectors of the local government units but do not intervene in their management.

In Rotuma, where language and customs differ from those in Fiji, the District Officer is the chief executive authority and he also has limited magisterial powers. A Rotuman Regulation Board, consisting of the District Officer and a number of Rotumans, makes regulations of local application.

Land Policy

Soon after the date of the cession a commission investigated the title to lands claimed by foreigners and as a result freehold titles to some 400,000 acres of Fijian land were granted. The Fijians now own 84% of the land, the unit of ownership being the mataqali or extended family. Under the Native Land Trust Ordinance of 1940 the control of all Fijian-owned land is in the hands of an independent Board administered on behalf of, and for the benefit of, the Fijian owners. The Board has power to set aside certain areas of land as reserves for the exclusive use of the Fijian owners and to lease land outside such reserves without reference to the owners. The sale of Fijian-owned land is prohibited except to the Crown, and then only where it is required for a public purpose. The sale of Crown Land is prohibited except in very special circumstances.

Taxation

Customs duty and port and customs service tax are levied on most imports. Income tax rates range from 1s. 3d. to 6s. 3d. on each £ of taxable income. Provision is made for personal, married, dependent children and widows' allowances. Companies other than non-Fijian shipping companies are liable for tax at the rate of 6s. 3d. in the £ on profits. Non-Fijian shipping companies are taxed at the rate of 4½d. in the £.

Surtax is chargeable on individual incomes at varying rates. Death and gift duties are also payable:

In 1958, £4,784,281 of total revenue was derived from Customs and excise duties, licences, income tax and other direct taxation. A further £171,944 was non-recurrent revenue caused by the transfer of Government Employees' Provident Fund Bonuses in respect of civil servants who accepted new pension terms. The main heads of expenditure were: Public Works Annually Recurrent £1,071,056; Medical £888,047*; Education £911,730*. A contribution of £233,544 was made from recurrent revenue to the Capital Fund. * (Including personal emoluments.)

Currency

Fiji currency notes are issued by the Fiji Currency Commissioners in denominations of £20, £10, £5, £1, 10s., and 5s.; silver coins in denominations of 2s., 1s., and 6d.; and smaller denominations of ½d., ¼d., and ⅛d. The Fiji £ is linked to sterling at the rate of £F.111 = £100.

Other Development

During 1951 at the request of various Fijian Provincial Councils, a Fijian Development Fund was established into which is paid an amount not exceeding £10 a ton from the proceeds of the sale of Fijian-produced copra. Such deposits are credited to the producing group or individual and bear interest at 2½%. The money thus accumulated may be expended only on works or schemes which will benefit the Fijians. The fund is administered by the Fijian Development Fund Board and by the end of July 1959 had accumulated a sum of £555,978.

Education

At the end of 1958 there were 73,275 pupils enrolled in schools, 3,994 of them in post-primary institutions. Both primary and post-primary education was carried on by missions, private...
bodies and Government. The roll of the Government Training College for Teachers was 208 and that of the newly-opened Roman Catholic Training College, 11.

There were 512 registered schools where staffing and accommodation were satisfactory and 45 "recognised" schools of a lower standard.

In 1958 there were 1,832 registered teachers of whom 1,677 were in Government service.

The number of students studying abroad under scholarship and bursary schemes was 70:

- United Kingdom . . . . 3
- New Zealand . . . . 33
- Australia . . . . 17
- India . . . . 17

During 1958 estimated gross expenditure on education from general revenue amounted to £1,060,450 compared with £43,306 in 1935. When local contributions by school authorities and expenditure from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds are taken into account, total expenditure on education during 1958 is estimated to have exceeded £1,300,000.

Libraries and Museums

The Fiji Museum at Suva contains a fine historical and ethnological collection relating to Fiji and Western Pacific Territories. The Carnegie Library and British Council Library at Suva and the Shri Ramkrishna Library at Nandi are the main lending and reference libraries in the Colony. The Fiji Society is concerned with subjects of historic, scientific and antiquarian interest to Fiji.

Health

The principal infectious diseases in Fiji are: influenza, pertussis, infantile diarrhoea, pulmonary tuberculosis. Malaria does not occur. The total bed capacity of hospitals in the Colony is 2,146, of which 2,093 are in Government institutions; there are also 44 dispensaries in the rural areas in charge of Assistant Medical Officers. In-patients in 1958 in Government hospitals numbered about 16,243 and the number of out-patients, including those treated at dispensaries, was 590,045. Leprosy is treated at the Fiji Leprosy Hospital, Makogai, with the most modern methods.

The Central Medical School, founded in 1888, provides a five-year course in medicine and a three-year course in dentistry, together with shorter ancillary courses. In 1958, 134 students from 12 territories were enrolled in these courses.

The estimated expenditure from general revenue on medical services in 1958 was £823,585, compared with £78,052 in 1935.

Communications

The Colony's main airport is the international airport at Nandi, 135 miles by road from Suva. Aircraft on the trans-Pacific route from Canada and the United States to Australia and New Zealand call at Nandi on both northbound and southbound flights. Services on these routes are operated by Canadian Pacific Airlines Limited, Pan American World Airways (Incorporated), and Qantas. Qantas operate a regular twice weekly service in each direction. In 1958, 1,745 aircraft from overseas landed at Nandi. During that year there was further reorganization of the services provided by Qantas and Tasman Empire Airways Limited between Fiji and Australia and New Zealand. T.E.A.L. now operate three times weekly between Nandi and New Zealand using DC6s, but one Solent flying boat has been retained to operate the Coral Route flight to Tahiti, calling also at Samoa and the Cook Islands.

An internal air service by Fiji Airways, a local company, operates regular flights between Suva, the international airport at Nandi, Lambasa, Savusavu and Taivuni.

There are 440 miles of permanent line on the light railway operated by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company for bringing sugar cane to the crushing mills. The average annual tonnage transported is about 980,000. A free passenger service is run twice weekly on a section of track 120 miles long.

There are some 1,000 miles of road, 727 miles of which have an all-weather surface.

The chief ports are Suva and Lautoka but overseas shipping also calls at Levuka, Nasavusavu and Rotuma to load copra. Overseas vessels calling at Fiji ports during 1958 numbered 317, the majority being cargo vessels some of which also carry passengers. A monthly passenger and cargo service is maintained by the Union Steam Ship Company and connects Suva with Auckland, Tonga and Western Samoa. There is a monthly cargo service from the United Kingdom to New Zealand calling at Suva. Regular inter-island cargo, passenger and mail services are maintained by a small number of motor vessels and there are numerous craft up to about 120 tons operating on irregular itineraries to and from the main centres.

Broadcasting

A broadcasting service is undertaken by the Fiji Broadcasting Commission from Stations VRH, VRH2 and VRH4 at Suva, operating on frequencies of 930, 840 and 3,980 kilocycles with power of 2 kilowatts, 500 watts and 500 watts. Station VRH3 broadcasts from Lautoka on 890 kilocycles on 2½ kilowatts. There are 20,117 licensed radio receivers in the Colony (1958).

Principal Occupations

The economy of the Colony is based on agriculture and to a smaller extent on mining. The cultivation of sugar cane is almost entirely in the hands of Indian peasant farmers. Fijians produce about three-fifths of the second important export crop, copra, and about 70% of the employees at the mines are Fijians. The bulk of the population is not, however, a wage-earning one.

At the end of 1958 there were 41 registered Industrial Associations.

Main Crops and Products

Mining is the only substantial non-agricultural industry and the Colony is otherwise wholly dependent upon primary production plus associated industries for coconut oil extraction and processing, cigarette manufacture and butter manufacture. Export income is secured from the sugar industry, from gold and manganese mining and from copra and bananas. Almost the whole of the gold and silver output is produced at Vatukoula, where 1,436 persons were employed in 1958. Production was 86,720 ozs. gold and 25,342 ozs. silver. There were 60 manganese mines in production during that year, the total output being 18,295 tons. Two copper deposits were opened up during 1958 and 303 tons of copper were exported. Trial shipments of iron ore were also exported.
Production for local consumption only, which normally closely approaches local needs, includes rice, root crops, such as taro, yams and cassava; fish and livestock products including whole milk, butter and ghee, beef, pork, goat flesh and eggs; and miscellaneous fruits and pulses.

The livestock population is estimated at: horses 16,000; cattle 113,000; pigs 21,000; goats 25,000; poultry 170,000.

Timber plantation formation continues on a limited scale with 459 acres planted during 1958, mainly with pines and mahogany. Considerable experimental work is being carried out in the satisfactory establishment of plantations. One large long-term concession area is operating over some 10,000 acres. 29 sawmills were in operation during the year, and timber production during 1958 was 8.6 million super feet, the highest production figure to date, compared with 7.4 million super feet output in 1957. This was in spite of the recession in the building trade. A steady changeover to other sources of fuel continues, particularly in the larger centres.

Reef and coastal fishing is undertaken in a small way by Fijians and Indians but the supply of local fish does not nearly meet the demand.

A geological survey is being undertaken to determine in detail the areas of possible economic mineralization. Upon completion a geological map of the Colony will be issued. The cost of the survey is being met from a grant of £55,019 from the United Kingdom.

In 1938 33.1% of total imports came from the United Kingdom, 49.0% from other Commonwealth countries and 17.9% from foreign countries. The corresponding figures in 1958 were: 33.9%, 45.2% and 20.9%.

In 1938 32.9% of total exports went to the United Kingdom, 58.7% to other Commonwealth countries and 8.4% to foreign countries. The corresponding figures in 1958 were: 43.2%, 46.5% and 10.3%.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are 78 co-operative societies, 51 of which are composed of Fijian members, 5 of Indian, 9 of Rotumans, 5 of Gilbertese, 2 of European and 6 of mixed races. The total membership is 3,903 and the total subscribed capital is £66,781. Over 90% of the copra produced is sold to local crushing mills. Cane growers sell their cane to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. About one third of all bananas for export are purchased by licensed buyers (three of them are Fijian organizations), who are required to pay a minimum price in accordance with ruling export sale values; the rest are shipped by co-operative organizations of one kind or another.

PITCAIRN ISLANDS GROUP

The small, volcanic islands of Pitcairn (two square miles in area), Henderson, Ducie and Oeno, of which only the first is inhabited, lie about 3,500 miles from Panama and 3,000 from Auckland. Regular sea communication with the outside world is limited to the brief calls of large passenger liners, which heave to for a few hours. A small radio station is of particular importance in arranging such calls with passing ships, especially when a doctor is required.

Pitcairn was discovered by Carteret in 1767. In 1790 the Bounty mutineers landed with some women from Otaheite and these were the forebears of the present inhabitants. It was annexed as a colony in 1838 when two British ships visited the island. The population was removed at its own request in 1856 but 40 soon returned, and today the Islanders number about 130. There has been some emigration to New Zealand which accounts for the recent decrease in population.

Pitcairn is a British colony by settlement and was brought within the jurisdiction of the Western Pacific High Commission in 1898. On the 1st April, 1952, by Order in Council made by Her Majesty the Queen, the administration was assumed by the Governor of Fiji, following the separation of the offices of the Governor of Fiji and High Commissioner for the Western Pacific. There is an Island Council consisting of the Chief Magistrate, two assessors and a secretary. The Chief Magistrate is elected triennially, and the other officers annually, by the people. The principal source of revenue is the sale of stamps. A Government school is established under a trained teacher. Medical attention is given by a nurse resident on the island, assisted in cases of emergency by doctors from passing ships.

Chief Magistrate—John Christian.
