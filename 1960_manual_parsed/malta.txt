Geographical Features
Malta consists of a plateau with a hard core of coralline limestone on the west side which descends by gentle steps to a plain composed of a thick stratum of soft globigerine limestone on the south-east. The highest point on the Island, situated near Dingli, is just over 800 feet above sea level. The Grand Harbour and Marsamxett Harbour are excellent ports of call, while safe anchorages are also provided by Marsaxlokk Bay, St. Paul's Bay and Mellieha Bay. There are no rivers, lakes or forests. In low-lying places the soil, which contains a high percentage of lime and is rich in phosphates, is deep, but elsewhere it is shallow. Cultivation is mainly in terraced fields where the soil is held by rubble walls.

Climate
The climate is healthy. There are no excessive periods of hot or cold weather. The lowest temperature in 1958 was 37° F. recorded on the 31st January, while the highest, 104° F., occurred on the 23rd August. The mean annual temperature is 66° F. and the mean annual rainfall is 20·53 inches. Rain is rare in June, July and August. In July the heat at sea level approaches that experienced in subtropical countries. The nights, however, are pleasant and cool, except during the prevalence of the sirocco wind which blows from the south-east.

History
From Roman times until 1530 Malta was subjected successively to Arab and Sicilian domination. In 1530, the Emperor Charles V gave the Island to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, who held it until 1798, when Napoleon Bonaparte invested it on his way to Egypt, having prepared the ground by intrigue and revolutionary propaganda. On 12th June, 1798, Ferdinand de Hompesch, the last Grand Master in Malta, capitulated without any resistance, and the Order was dispersed. The French installed
themselves in the islands, but their interference with Maltese laws and customs brought about a sharp reaction, and the Maltese drove the French troops within the fortified towns and, with the help of the British fleet, held them closely blockaded for two years, after which the French, reduced to extremities, surrendered to the British.

In 1800 the Government was placed in the hands of Great Britain. The Treaty of Amiens provided that the islands should be restored to the Knights, but this was prevented by the recommencement of the war, and they were finally annexed to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris in 1814.

Malta was a vital point in allied strategy in the Second World War, and the Island was subjected to heavy enemy air attacks between the entry of Italy into the war in 1940 and the liberation of North Africa in 1943. In 1942, Malta was awarded the George Cross in recognition of the part she had played in the War.

**Constitution**

Following the resignation of Mr. Mintoff's Government on the 24th April, 1958, a State of Emergency was declared in Malta on the 30th April, 1958, primarily to enable the Governor to continue the administration of Government in the absence of Ministers. A new constitution was introduced on the 15th April, 1959, which is contained in the Malta (Constitution) Order in Council, 1959, and the Royal Instructions issued on the 30th March, 1959.

Provision is made under the Constitution for an Executive Council, presided over by the Governor, consisting of the Chief Secretary, the Legal Secretary and the Financial Secretary as *ex officio* members and of such other nominated members (appointed by the Governor) of whom not less than three shall be persons holding a public office.

**Land Policy**

There is no restriction on the alienation of land to non-Maltese, but the Mortmain Law restricts the alienation of land to religious bodies or institutions under certain circumstances.

**Taxation**

The principal forms of taxation are income tax, import duties, excise duties, stamp duties, entertainment duties, tombola duty, licence duties, and succession and donation duties.

Income tax, introduced in 1949, is levied on all personal incomes, with certain exceptions, at the following rates:

- 2s. for every pound of the first £200.
- 3s. for every pound of the next £300.
- 4s. 6d. for every pound of the next £400.
- 6s. 6d. for every pound of the remainder.

The tax on companies is at the rate of 5s. on every pound of the chargeable income.

A surtax is also levied on incomes exceeding £2,500 at the following rates:

- 2s. for every pound of the first £500.
- 2s. 6d. for every pound of the next £500.
- 3s. 6d. for every pound of the next £500.
- 5s. for every pound of the remainder.

**Personal deductions:**

| Category          | Rate |
|-------------------|------|
| Single persons    | 240  |
| Husband and wife  | 420  |
| Children          | 80   per child |

There are also deductions for dependants and allowances in respect of contributions to pensions funds, insurance policies, and medical expenses.

Development Plans

During the financial year ended 31st March, 1959, a total of £4,573,392 was expended on development and other capital works.

Since the end of the War, direct aid by way of free grant from Her Majesty's Government to Malta has amounted to over £41 million, mainly in respect of capital expenditure including War Damage and Reconstruction grants.

The Government published a Five-Year Development Plan for the Maltese Islands in October, 1959, covering the period 1959–64 and providing for an expenditure of £32½ million of which £29¼ million is being made available by Her Majesty's Government in loans and grants including £19¼ million from Colonial Development and Welfare sources.

The Plan aims at diversifying the Maltese economy which has hitherto been largely sustained by the expenditure of the fighting services; this expenditure is bound to decline because of changing defence policies and concepts.

The objectives of the Plan, and the measures being taken to reach them, may be summarized as follows:

(a) The Harbour, which is Malta's leading natural asset, is to be developed by the conversion of the Dockyard to commercial use and by the construction of modern deep water quays and other modern port facilities. A £6 million loan from Colonial Development and Welfare sources is being made for the Dockyard operation which has been entrusted to a United Kingdom firm of ship repairers. Work on the new quays and other port facilities has already started.

(b) Funds are provided for the building of a fully serviced industrial estate, on which a start has already been made, some factories being now available for letting. Capital loans and grants are also offered to industry, in addition to an income tax "holiday" and customs duty easements available under a recently enacted Aids to Industry Ordinance. Besides these direct aids, the Plan also sets out to provide or improve the basic services necessary for industrialization apart from the port already referred to above, i.e., the expansion of the water and electricity supplies and the modernization and expansion of the telephone services. Technical Education is also to be developed in order to meet industry's increasing needs for skills.

(c) The tourist industry is being built up to take advantage of Malta's climatic, scenic and historical assets. The capital loans and grants to industry referred to above will also be available for hotels.

(d) The two indigenous industries, agriculture and fisheries, are being assisted towards greater efficiency.

(e) Although the greater share of the funds is allocated to these economic objectives, substantial provision is made for the social services—primary and secondary education, health, housing, sewers and public buildings.

Education

Compulsory education was introduced in 1946. Primary education is carried on principally in free Government schools which are Roman Catholic. There are 113 Primary schools, where Maltese and English are the only languages of instruction, with an enrolment of 54,590 pupils; and six Grammar schools with 3,070 pupils. The Royal University of Malta, founded in 1769, has an average attendance of 283 students and grants degrees in divinity, law, medicine, architecture, engineering, dental surgery, pharmacy, arts and science. The number of Maltese studying or attending post-graduate courses in United Kingdom Universities or colleges during 1958 was 40. There are 30 evening classes for languages and commercial subjects with an attendance of 602, and literacy classes for illiterates and semi-illiterates with an attendance of 1,300. There are three Secondary Technical Schools providing five-year courses leading to G.C.E., and a Sixth Form for 979 pupils of whom 215 are girls. One Technical school for craft training—admission 14 to 17 years—provides a three-year course for 751 pupils. An apprenticeships school provides five-year courses for 245 apprentices on the day release system. St. Patrick's Residential School caters for 90 boarders, age 9 to 15. The School of Art provides seven evening classes attended by 317 persons of all ages. Evening classes mainly for emigrants have an average attendance of 1,000 persons, and 186 persons are undergoing accelerated full-time technical training in various trades, at two Government Industrial Training Centres in Malta and one in Gozo. These centres were started under the vocational training scheme for prospective migrants. There is a Government home for girls with a total of 60 inmates. The total number of private (primary and secondary) schools is 93 with an attendance of about 15,250 pupils.

In 1958–59 expenditure on education was £1,784,390 (of which £590,705 was capital expenditure). Expenditure on education in 1935 was £149,521.

Communications

The international airport of Malta is Luqa Airfield, which is also a Royal Air Force Station. There are other service airfields at Hal Far and Ta Qali. British European Airways operate the following services:—(a) three services daily to London via Ajaccio or Naples and/or Rome and/or Nice; (b) three services a week to Catania; (c) daily services to Tripoli, and (d) three services a week to Tripoli and Benghazi. In addition there are the following coach class services from Malta: Airwork Limited Malta via Entebbe–Nairobi and Malta via Ndola–Lusaka–Salisbury once every two weeks; Skyways Limited from Malta to Cyprus and Malta to Tunis once every week; and a freight service by Hunting Clan Air Transport Limited from London via Frankfurt–Rome–Malta–Central Africa. During 1958 3,283 aircraft off-loaded 30,232 passengers while 3,282 aircraft took off 31,501 passengers; 28,848 passengers passed through Malta in transit.

The size of the Island does not provide scope for internal air services and the only railway line ceased to operate in 1931.

Eight miles of roads have been resurfaced with hot-laid bituminous macadam. The standard surfacing for main roads remains penetration macadam (semi-grouting), and 430 miles are paved in this method using limestone aggregate and bituminous emulsion; 65 miles of country roads are paved in water-bound macadam.

The number and tonnage of ships which entered the Grand Harbour during 1958, are: 1,693 steamships, tonnage 2,392,166; 265 sailing ships, tonnage 22,829.

There is no regular passenger line between Malta and the United Kingdom. The Italian Tirrenia Line runs a service calling at Naples, Messina, Catania, Syracuse, Malta and Tripoli, every five days, and the Laferla shipping line four times a week between Malta and Syracuse. A ferry service running between Marfa and Mgarr links the two Islands of Malta and Gozo.

Broadcasting

There are no broadcasting stations in Malta. The number of licences for wireless receiving sets on 31st July, 1959, was, however, 17,865. Messrs. Rediffusion (Malta) Limited operate a wired broadcasting station situated at Hamrun. The number of subscribers on 31st July, 1959 was 46,338.

A broadcasting commission to organize political broadcasting has been set up.
