GIBRALTAR

Geographical Features and Area

Gibraltar is a narrow peninsula running southwards from the south-west coast of Spain, with an area of 2½ square miles. It consists of a long, high mountain called The Rock and a sandy plain to the north of it, raised only a few feet above the level of the sea, called the North Front. Its greatest elevation is 1,396 feet, its length 2½ miles and its greatest breadth nearly 1 mile.

Population

The population is European and at the Census of July 1951 numbered 22,848. At the end of 1958 it was estimated at 25,637.

Climate

The climate is mild and temperate; snow or frost is extremely rare. The mean minimum and maximum temperatures in winter are 45° and 65° respectively. In summer a warm breeze laden with moisture, known as the “Levanter”, strikes the eastern face of the Rock, condenses in the sky above and causes a cloud pall to hang over the city and bay. During this period the climate is humid and relaxing. The mean minimum and
maximum temperatures in summer are 55° and 85° respectively. The rainy season is spread over the period September to May; the average annual rainfall is 35 inches.

History

Gibraltar was possessed successively by the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans and Visigoths, but remained uninhabited till the Mohammedan invasion of Spain. It was held alternately by Moors and Spaniards until 1704 when, during the war of the Spanish succession, it was captured by the British forces under Admiral Sir George Rooke and ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. The cession was renewed by the Treaty of Versailles in 1783. Many attempts have been made to take Gibraltar, especially during the great siege in 1779-83, when General Eliott (afterwards Lord Heathfield) defended it against the united forces of Spain and France, but all have been unsuccessful and it has remained in British hands since its capture in 1704.

Constitution

The Gibraltar (Legislative Council) Order in Council, 1950, as amended by a further Order in Council which came into operation on 10th August, 1956, provides for the establishment of a Legislative Council consisting of the Governor as President, the Speaker, three ex officio members, two nominated members appointed by the Governor and seven elected members. The ex officio members are the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary. A Speaker was appointed in 1958. The Order in Council empowers the Governor to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Colony with the advice and consent of the Council. The Governor possesses the usual reserved power to pass into law any measure necessary or expedient in his opinion in the interests of public order, public faith or good government (including defence).

The Gibraltar Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions provide that the Governor shall be advised in the exercise of his powers by an Executive Council consisting of four ex officio members and four unofficial members. The ex officio members are the Deputy Fortress Commander, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General and the Financial Secretary.

Taxation

This is mainly indirect. An Income Tax Ordinance was enacted in April 1952 and came into force on the 1st April 1953; the standard rate, for companies and individuals, is 2s. in the £. There are no excise duties.

The main heads of taxation are:

- Customs.
- Income Tax.
- Estate Duties.
- Stamp Duties.
- Licences.
- Fuel Oil Tax.

The items subject to import duty are alcoholic beverages, perfumed spirits, motor spirits, tobacco, coffee, mechanical lighters, motor vehicles, motor vehicle spares and accessories, photographic cameras and cinema projectors, radio sets and spares, razor blades, watches and clocks.

The Government lottery yielded £108,538 in 1958.

Approximately 40 students of both sexes are undergoing courses of higher education in the United Kingdom.

British European Airways operate daily services between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom both direct and via Madrid. Gibraltar Airways and Royal Air Maroc operate a daily service (two flights) to and from Tangier. A modern Air Terminal building constructed by the Government at a cost of £40,000 was officially opened on the 8th April, 1959.

The length of road open for traffic is 5½ miles in the city, 4 miles in the south district and about 3¼ miles in the area of North Front and Catalan Bay. All roads are suitable for motor traffic.

Broadcasting

A Government Broadcasting Station (Radio Gibraltar) under the control of the Public Relations Officer was inaugurated on the 16th February, 1958. It broadcasts in English and Spanish for approximately 12 hours daily, 5 hours being leased for commercial broadcasting. In addition to live and locally recorded programmes, use is made of B.B.C. transcriptions and relays. The power of the station is 1kW and it operates on a frequency of 1,484 kc/s, 202·2 metres. Its coverage is about 50 miles. There is also a local wired broadcasting service operated by the Military Authorities for military personnel, which relays programmes from the B.B.C. During 1958, 4,666 radio receiving licences were issued.

Principal Occupations

Almost half of the male wage-earners in Gibraltar, of whom a large proportion are Spaniards entering for work daily, are employed in one or other of the Service Departments, the Colonial Government, or the City Council. Commercial enterprises provide employment for a substantial number of clerical workers in shipping offices and trading agencies. Hotels, catering services, retail distributing trades and stevedoring are the other main sources of private employment. Other local industries are the processing of tobacco and the roasting and blending of coffee. There is also a fish and fruit canning factory.

At the end of December 1958 the total insured labour force was 17,167. There are 17 registered trade unions in the Colony. The reported total paid-up membership of the 14 employees’ unions was 4,754.

Trade

Actual figures of imports are available only for dutiable articles and the figures given below are therefore largely estimates:

| Year | Total Imports | Re-exports |
|------|--------------|------------|
| 1953 | £8,108,213   | £3,072,267 |
| 1954 | £6,483,686   | £2,758,701 |

| 1958 | £9,925,482   | £2,829,292 |

The figures of re-exports are only in respect of goods liable to import duty upon entry.

Tourist Trade

The value of the tourist trade in 1958 was estimated at £2,000,000.

The number of visitors passing through the Colony continues to increase. To meet this increase two hotels are being enlarged, a new one has been built and two luxury hotels are in course of construction. In addition every possible facility is being given. Places of interest such as the Caves, Galleries, Moorish Castle and the Upper Rock may now be visited without permits.
