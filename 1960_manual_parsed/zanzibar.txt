Geographical Features

The island of Zanzibar is the largest coralline island on the East African coast and is separated from the mainland by a channel 22½ miles across at its narrowest part. To the north-east at a distance of some 25 miles lies the island of Pemba. Both islands are low-lying, the highest land being little above 390 feet (Masingini Ridge).

Climate

The mean maximum temperature is 84·4° and the mean minimum 76·6° (Zanzibar Town). The warmest season is from January to March (average 82° to 86°) and the coolest, June to September (average 75° to 78°). The average annual rainfall in Pemba varies from 65 inches in the north to 92 inches in the south; in Zanzibar from 49 inches to over 72 inches, the maximum being recorded in the centre of the Island. There is no real dry season but the rainy seasons are well marked, being March to May in the south-west monsoon and in November and December at the start of the north-east monsoon.

History

In 1698 the Arabs of Oman captured Mombasa, where the Portuguese had built a fort in 1592. Thereafter the whole of the East African coast as far south as Cape Delgado, including Zanzibar and Pemba, passed from the Portuguese into the hands of the Arabs. Seyyid Said bin Sultan, the founder of modern Zanzibar and of its clove industry, became ruler of Oman in 1805 and later transferred his capital from Muscat to Zanzibar. During his reign Zanzibar became both politically and commercially the principal town in East Africa. In 1861, by an award of Lord Canning, then Governor-General of India, the ruler of Oman's possessions in Africa became independent and from that date Oman and Zanzibar have remained politically separate.

By an agreement in 1886 Great Britain and Germany recognized the Sultanate of Zanzibar over the islands of the coast (including Zanzibar and Pemba) and a ten-mile wide strip on the mainland.

In 1887 the Sultan handed over the administration of his possessions to the north of Vanga on the African continent to the British East Africa Association (later, the Imperial British East Africa Company). The Government of these territories eventually passed to the British Government and they are now known as the Kenya Protectorate. Zanzibar still receives the sum of £16,000 a year from Kenya for the rights which the latter exercises in the coastal strip.

In June 1890 Zanzibar and Pemba were placed under British protection by the Sultan, Seyyid Ali bin Said. The Protectorate was proclaimed in that year and the following year a regular form of Government was set up.

The present Sultan acceded in 1911. In 1913 the control of the Sultanate passed from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office, legal effect being given to the change in 1914 by a new Zanzibar Order in Council under which the offices of His Majesty's Agent and Consul-General and His Highness's First Minister were merged in that of the newly created post of British Resident who was appointed subject to the control of the Governor of the British East Africa Protectorate as High Commissioner. A Protectorate Council was constituted as an advisory body with His Highness as President and the British Resident as Vice-President.

In 1925 the office of High Commissioner was abolished and the British Resident was made directly responsible to the Colonial Office. Executive and Legislative Councils were constituted in 1926 in place of the old advisory Protectorate Council.

Constitution

The Government is administered by the British Resident, who exercises his functions under the Zanzibar Order in Council, 1924. The Privy Council is presided over by the Sultan with the British Resident, the Heir Apparent to the Throne, the Chief Secretary and the Attorney-General. The Executive Council is presided over by the British Resident and comprises four ex officio members. The Legislative Council is presided over by the British Resident and comprises four ex officio members, nine official, and twelve unofficial members, of whom six are elected by common roll franchise, and six appointed by the Sultan on the advice of the British Resident.
Land Policy

Under the Land Alienation Decree of 1939, subject to certain provisos, permanent alienation of land, leases exceeding two years, and mortgages, by Arabs or Africans have no effect without the consent of a Land Alienation Board. In certain of the more undeveloped areas of the island, mainly inhabited by the indigenous Africans, the land is communally held and, according to native custom, cannot be alienated, although this custom has given way to freehold tenure in some places where plantations of economic trees have been established. Throughout the plantation areas (west and centre of both islands) land is freehold and there is no other statutory qualification as to its disposal. A good deal of land is, however, reserved under the system of quasi-religious dedication of Muslim law known as wakf.

Taxation

The principal forms of taxation are Customs import duty, clove duty and income tax. There is no poll or hut tax.

The Income Tax Decree provides for taxation on incomes of over £225. With effect from the 1958 income year, tax on income from agricultural sources is charged. The rate of taxation is in a graduated scale of Sh. 2 in the £ on the first £400 of taxable income, rising by Sh. 1 in the £ on each further £400 up to £2,000; thence on each further £500 up to £3,000; and on each £1,000 up to £9,000; on the excess over £9,000 Sh. 15 in the £ is charged.

Public Debt: a loan of £232,343 from the National Bank of India Finance and Development Corporation Limited for the new Zanzibar Electricity Scheme.

The main heads of expenditure in 1958 were Agriculture £132,939, Education £355,346, Health £303,998, Pensions £189,885; Police £159,544; Port and Marine £142,453; Provincial Administration £114,462; Public Works £366,763. The total Development Expenditure was £420,469.

Currency

The standard coin of the Protectorate is the East African Currency Board shilling (Shs. 20 = £1) with the following subsidiary coinage:—50 cents (cupro-nickel) and 10 cents, 5 cents, 1 cent (bronze). East African Currency Board notes are legal tender for the amount expressed thereon.

Development Plans

Zanzibar has received grants to a total of £1,369,794 under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts in connexion with the Ten-Year Development Programme. From these grants £974,716 was issued up to 31st December, 1955. The programme was revised in 1951 and since that time practically all the permanent recurrent expenditure has been taken into the Protectorate Estimates.

A new development plan was made in 1955 to cover the years 1955–59. This provided for total expenditure of £1,300,000 of which £909,000 is to be found from Protectorate sources, the remainder coming from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds, of which approximately £291,000 was carried forward from the Ten-Year Development Programme.

In 1959 a development plan was made for the period 1960–64 covering expenditure on the following heads:

| Head                          | £     |
|-------------------------------|-------|
| Agriculture and Natural Resources | 350,000 |
| Social Services                | 200,000 |
| Works and Communications       | 730,000 |
| General Services               | 90,000  |
| Works Extraordinary            | 350,000 |
| Reserve                        | 180,000 |
| **Total**                      | **£1,900,000** |

Education

The following schools are maintained by Government:

| School Type | Boys | Girls | Pupils |
|-------------|------|-------|--------|
| Primary     | 51   | 12    | 11,747 |
| Secondary   | 2    | 1     | 348    |

In addition there are 10 Assisted primary schools (941 boys and 1,853 girls) and 4 private primary schools (219 boys and 45 girls), 2 Assisted secondary schools (195 boys and 79 girls), 2 Government Teacher Training schools (117 men, 54 women), 4 private kindergarten schools, and 1,092 private Koranic schools with an estimated enrolment of 19,150 pupils.

The Assisted schools are mainly for Indians, and include those run by various Christian Missions. There is a Muslim Academy for Islamic studies, and each year about 10 boys are sent to the Mombasa Institute of Muslim Education for a four-year course of technical training. A Trade school was started in 1956 to train boys for the building trade. Primary education in Government schools is free for Arabs and Africans. Post-secondary education is not yet available in the Protectorate and students proceed to Makerere College, Uganda, or elsewhere. Scholarships are provided for selected scholars to go to the United Kingdom and to India. In 1958 more than 80 such scholars were being supported by Government grants.

European children usually attend schools on the mainland or elsewhere. Parents receive financial assistance from the Government, but have to pay a special education tax.

Expenditure on education in 1958 was £355,346, compared with £27,220 in 1935.

Health

Preventive measures include the normal controls on immigration, environmental sanitation, anti-malarial control, the supervision of buildings, the maintenance of District Rural Units, District Maternity Units, antenatal clinics and a School Dental Service.
On the curative side there is a large new Group Hospital in Zanzibar of 324 beds serving all sections of the community, and two General Hospitals at Wete and Chake Chake in Pemba of 78 and 55 beds respectively. Government maintains a Tuberculosis Hospital of 40 beds, a Leprosarium for 100 patients in Pemba, and participates with one of the Missions in maintaining a second Leprosarium in Zanzibar Island, and a Home for the Aged and Infirm with accommodation for 155. A substantial annual grant is made to the Zanzibar Maternity Association towards the maintenance of the Mwembelado Maternity Home of 11 beds.

The total expenditure of the Health Department in 1958 was £303,998 compared with £35,577 in 1935.

Communications

Zanzibar airport is situated four and a half miles from the town. It has one all-weather runway. Operations are restricted to aircraft with a maximum all-up weight of 44,000 lb. This figure is ample for the types of aircraft in use at present, but the construction of the runway and the adjacent terrain is such that extensions could easily be made. Air Traffic Control and other services are provided. The airport is open during daylight hours. Pemba Airport is situated approximately six miles from Chake Chake. There is an all-weather runway with a landing restriction of 33,000 lb. Only temporary terminal facilities exist at present.

Zanzibar has 387 miles of roads, of which 276 miles are bitumen surfaced; Pemba has 227 miles, of which 81 are bitumen surfaced. There are no railways.

Ocean-going vessels maintain regular and frequent communication with all parts of the world. Government steamers maintain regular weekly connexions with Pemba and Dar es Salaam. Coasting vessels, carrying both passengers and cargo, also maintain regular services between Zanzibar, Kenya and Tanganyika ports.

Broadcasting

The Government broadcasting service provides one and a half hour's programme in Kiswahili six days a week, on a wavelength of 62·5 metres. The power of the transmitter, which is situated at Marhubi, is 250 W. The station is the property of and operated by Cable and Wireless Limited under an agreement with Government. It is estimated that there are several thousand receiving sets, most of them in Zanzibar Town.

Principal Occupations

A large proportion of the rural population is engaged in food production; paid labour is largely dependent on the Protectorate's two major industries, cloves and coconuts, and the processing and handling of their products. Agricultural labourers employed by Government number about 1,200. Fishing is also the occupation of a large number but they usually cultivate as well.

In urban areas, the principal occupations are transport, building, port and dock labour, domestic service, employment in sanitation and public works, clerical work, and business.

At the end of 1958 there were 17 registered trade unions with a membership of 3,491, and one employers union.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are cloves, coconuts, rice, cassava, sweet potatoes, citrus fruits, chillies, tobacco, maize and millet.

The number of cattle in Pemba is approximately 25,000 and in Zanzibar 10,000. The export of hides and skins is a useful item in the Protectorate's economy.

There are two small forests, one in Zanzibar and one in Pemba which yield a small amount of Mfuu (Vitex cuneata) and Mtondoo (Calophyllum inophyllum) and other species, while jackwood (Artocarpus integra) is a useful timber of the clove areas.

Fishing is an important activity and although most of the fish is consumed locally, small quantities of both fresh and dried fish are exported. Fishermen are encouraged to purchase small powered craft by means of a Government hire purchase scheme, and are instructed by the Fisheries Officer in the use and maintenance of modern types of gear.

The only industries are the distillation of clove-oil, coconut-oil expression and the manufacture of soap. The manufacture of coir fibre and rope by hand is fairly extensive in the coastal areas, but most of the resulting product is at present sold locally. A few factories to process coir fibre have recently been established.

The chief imports are rice and grain, textiles, motor spirit and petroleum, sugar, tobacco and cigarettes, flour, ghee, sesame, cattle, dried fish, jute bags, sacks and straw bags.
Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

The Clove Growers' Association, established in 1928 and incorporated by Decree in 1934, assists in stabilizing the price of cloves and distils and markets clove oil. The Association also assists in the marketing of other products, for example, tobacco, chillies, derris root and cacao. It also provides many valuable services to agriculturists.

The Copra Board, established in 1950, administers the proceeds of a cess on exported copra products for the benefit of the copra industry.

At the end of 1958 there were 58 registered co-operative societies with a membership of 4,078.
