NORTH BORNEO

Area
North Borneo, which includes the whole of the northern portion of the island of Borneo, is 29,388 square miles in area or roughly the size of Ireland. It is divided into four Residencies: Sandakan, 9,534 square miles; Tawau, 7,011 square miles; Interior, 7,613 square miles and West Coast, 5,195 square miles. Since October, 1955, Labuan Island, 35 square miles, has been administered by a District Officer who is responsible directly to the Chief Secretary, Jesselton.

Population
The 1958 (end-year) estimate was 416,435:
Indigenous ........................................... 276,186
Chinese .................................................. 102,213
European (including Eurasian) .................. 2,065
Others ..................................................... 35,971

Principal Towns
All are situated on the coast, and have good harbours:

| Population at 1951 Census |
|---------------------------|
| Jesselton (capital) ....... 11,704 |
| Sandakan .................... 14,499 |
| Tawau ....................... 4,282 |
| Victoria, Labuan .......... 2,526 |
| Kudat ....................... 1,895 |

Geographical Features
Central mountain ranges from 4,000 to 6,000 feet in height, rise somewhat sharply from low hills nearer the coast and culminate in Mount Kinabalu (13,455 feet) the highest mountain in the East Indies. The coastline is formed mainly of alluvial flats, with many creeks and swamps. Hills and valleys in most cases are covered with dense forest and there are many rivers. The most extensive plain is that on the east coast, irrigated by the river Kinabatangan and its tributaries, and believed to contain some 4,000 square miles of rich and fertile soil. In the interior are found the Keningau and Tambunan plains which are traversed by the Pegalan River. The Keningau plain consists of wide stretches of grassland, while Tambunan maintains a large padi-planting population.

Labuan, 35 square miles in area, is an island lying six miles off the mainland. It has an excellent, well-sheltered harbour, and during 1956 regained its pre-war status as a free port.

Climate
This is relatively cool for a place situated so near the equator.

| Mean Maximum Temperatures (inches) |
|-------------------------------------|
| Jesselton .................................. 87·6° 74·2° 100·28 |
| Sandakan ................................... 88·3° 73·7° 96·22 |

Humidity is relatively high in most places although there are a few comparatively dry belts. The north-east monsoon begins about the middle of October and lasts until March or April; the south-west monsoon prevails from the beginning of May until August. Moderately strong gales are common during the north-east monsoon but Borneo lies outside the typhoon belt.

History
Early in the sixteenth century the Sultan of Brunei was the overlord of the bulk of the territories which now comprise Sarawak, Brunei and North Borneo. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries European intrusion reduced the power of Brunei. An era of lawlessness ensued, and by the middle of the nineteenth century piracy had become such a scourge that charts warned merchants against trading in those waters. The Sultan of Brunei offered the island of Labuan to the British Government in 1844 and in accordance with that offer the island was annexed in 1846, the cession being formally agreed to in a treaty with the Sultan in 1847. In 1878, after protracted negotiations, a large area on the mainland was ceded by the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu to Mr. Alfred Dent and his associates, in return for annual payments. The cession conveyed full rights over the territory, and was made in perpetuity. In November 1881, the British Government granted a charter to the British North Borneo Provisional Association, Limited, which had taken over the concessions from Mr. Dent and his associates, and the company assumed charge of the territories under the title of the British North Borneo (Chartered) Company in 1882. This Company governed British North Borneo until January 1942, when it fell to the Japanese, and was the last of the chartered companies to administer an area of the British Empire. The territory was liberated by the Australian 9th Division in September 1945, and was under military administration until 15th July, 1946, when it became part of the new Crown Colony of North Borneo.

The Island of Labuan, formerly administered as a separate colony from 1846 until 1890 and later as a settlement of the Straits Settlements, also became part of the new Colony of North Borneo on the same date under the Labuan Order in Council.
Constitution

The constitution is regulated by Letters Patent under which a governor and commander-in-chief of the Colony is appointed. Under this instrument full sovereign rights are assumed over British North Borneo, following the North Borneo Cession Order in Council. The three instruments bear the date 10th July, 1946.

Authority was given under Letters Patent of 1950, for the establishment of a Legislative Council and Executive Council in and for the Colony, in place of the Advisory Council which had existed hitherto, and an Order in Council brought into force on the 17th October, 1950, provides for the establishment of a Legislative Council. It is presided over by the Governor and consists of three ex officio members, nine official members and ten nominated members. The Executive Council consists of three ex officio members, two official members and four nominated members.

Land Policy

There are two forms of land tenure: leases available to all, and Native Titles available to natives (who include all indigenous inhabitants). No new lease for town or country land (not being a Native Title) may be for more than 99 years. The area opened up by natives (excluding village reserves) is approximately 135,400 acres, almost all on individual title. All unalienated land is the property of the Crown.

Taxation

The main form of direct taxation is income tax. The rate applicable to companies, incorporated or registered in the Colony or elsewhere, is as follows:

(a) if they elect to be taxed on undistributed exempt trading profit . . . 20%
(b) on all other chargeable income . . . 40%

The rates applicable to individuals are from 3½% on the first $12,000 of chargeable income to 20% on chargeable income in excess of $52,000. Arrangements have been concluded with the Governments of the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden for the avoidance of double taxation.

The other main source of taxation is Customs import and export duties. The highest general rate on imports is 30% ad valorem on motor vehicles, the preferential rate being 10%. Manufactured goods are usually charged 10% and textiles and clothing 15%, with a preferential rate of 7½%. The free list includes essential foodstuffs, building materials, and passengers' personal and household effects. Essential machinery and plant of British manufacture is also free of duty. The majority of goods exported are dutiable; 10% of the f.o.b. value is an average charge, but certain items are given special attention, e.g., rubber is charged 5% ad valorem when the fixed price does not exceed 60 cents per pound, and on an increasing scale as the fixed price rises, e.g., with fixed price at $1·50 per pound the duty is 17 cents. In fixing the price an allowance of 5 cents per pound against the average Singapore buying price is made. In addition, cesses are levied on all rubber exported; ½ cent per pound for the development of the rubber industry, and 2 cents per pound to finance replanting and new planting by estates and smallholders. Most of the timber exported is charged a royalty, but other timber is charged export duty in accordance with the Timber Roll.

To encourage the cultivation of certain crops exemption from export duty has been granted as follows:

Manila hemp 5% ad valorem only is payable (Abaca) on hemp exported before 1st January, 1962.

Cocoa . . Exemption from export duty up to 1st January 1967.

Palm Oil and Palm Kernels Exemption from export duty up to 1st January 1973.

Public Finance

From the re-establishment of civil government, following the liberation from Japanese occupation in July 1946, to the end of 1958 local revenue was in excess of recurrent expenditure.

| Year | Revenue(a) | Expenditure(b) |
|------|------------|---------------|

| Public Works          | $10,750,064 |

The total of the Public Debt at 31st December, 1958, was $21,383,872.
Currency

The currency in circulation consists mainly of Malayan currency, which was introduced by the British Military Administration immediately after the liberation of the territory, with a small quantity of British North Borneo Chartered Company notes and coin issued before the Japanese occupation. Chartered Company currency ceased to be legal tender as from 1st September, 1953, but when handed into offices of the Treasury it remains redeemable at its face value for Malayan currency. The buying and selling rates of the Malayan dollar fluctuate slightly in accordance with the Singapore market. For the purpose of conversion to sterling, the value of a dollar is taken at 2s. 4d.

Development Plans

A Development Plan was prepared in 1955 for the period ending 1960, which envisaged the expenditure of approximately $47,000,000. Early in 1956 it was apparent, however, that the development plan would need considerable amendment, partly as a result of fiscal measures consequent upon release from United Kingdom Treasury control, and partly as a result of a revision of priorities arising from new needs. This revision has been accomplished and a modified scheme prepared for the expenditure of approximately $32,700,000 during the period 1957 to April 1960. The projected sources of finance are:

Colonial Development and Welfare $ Grants 3,700,000 Loan Fund 13,000,000 Colony Fund 16,000,000

to be directed towards the following broad heads of expenditure:

| Head of Expenditure          | Amount   |
|------------------------------|----------|
| Education                    | 2,700,000|
| Health                       | 810,000  |
| Transport and Communications | 9,450,000|
| Agriculture                  | 1,050,000|
| Municipal Services           | 8,330,000|
| Miscellaneous                | 9,970,000|

A Development Plan for the period 1960-1964 is in course of preparation; a significant proportion of the total funds likely to be available for development works during this new period will accrue from a Colonial Development and Welfare allocation of £3,000,000.

Education

There are 88 Government and 224 grant-aided primary schools, and 4 Government and 20 grant-aided secondary schools. 18 of the grant-aided schools are maintained by Local Authorities which, in 1958, raised $153,895 towards their maintenance. Government also maintains a Trade School and a Teachers' Training College, and conducts a number of Adult Evening Classes in science and languages.

Primary education is provided in Malay, Chinese, English and, to a small extent, in Kadazan, the language of the largest indigenous community. Secondary education is provided principally in English and Chinese.

The Government Secondary School in Jesselton is the only school at present providing a post-certificate course to university matriculation standard, with a main bias towards science. Six of the secondary schools provide a full course to Overseas School Certificate, two Chinese schools provide a six-year secondary course, and all other secondary schools at present provide a short three-year course toward a local certificate.

In 1958, the enrolment in primary schools was Malay, 12,158; Chinese, 13,903; and English, 11,515. There were 2,257 pupils in English Secondary Schools and 762 in Chinese Secondary Schools.

The expenditure by the Education Department from Colony funds on education was $2,092,326 in 1958.

Libraries

There is a reference library in the Secretariat and reference and lending libraries are maintained at the headquarters of the Education Department and at the Information Office, Jesselton. The Information Office has organized branch libraries in Sandakan and four other smaller towns.

Health

The principal diseases are malaria, pulmonary tuberculosis, acute respiratory disease, bowel infections and skin complaints. There are two general hospitals (422 beds); five cottage hospitals (367 beds); and 12 dispensaries (204 beds). There are also 18 dispensaries situated in outlying districts staffed by Senior Dressers under the supervision of District Medical Officers. In 1958 out-patients numbered 256,017 and in-patients 15,543.

There is a mental hospital at Sandakan with 100 beds.

There are Health Centres in Sandakan and Jesselton each under the direct supervision of a Health Visitor. At these centres, maternity and child welfare clinics are held. Subsidiary rural health clinics in the Jesselton and Sandakan districts are regularly visited by the Health Centre staff and serve the up-country villages. Native midwives are being trained at each of the main hospitals and at each Cottage Hospital.

Expenditure on medical services from Colony funds in 1958 amounted to $3,414,287.

Communications

There are three civil airports, situated at Jesselton, Sandakan and Labuan, that at Labuan being of international standard. Malayan Airways provide air services between Singapore, Kuching, Sibu, Brunei, Labuan, Jesselton and Sandakan, and from Labuan the Colony gains access by air to Hong Kong by Cathay Pacific Airways, and to Djakarta and Manila by Garuda Indonesian Airways. In 1958 there were 13,500 movements of aircraft. An internal feeder service linking Labuan, Keningau, Ranau, Jesselton, Kudat, Sandakan, Tawau and Lahad Datu is operated by Borneo Airways.

In 1958, 641,238 passengers were carried on the railways and the weight of freight hauled was 51,695 tons. The total length of the railway, which is of metre gauge and serves the West Coast from Jesselton southwards and part of the interior, is 116 miles.

There are 212 miles of roads with bitumen-sealed surface; 77 miles of other metalled roads; and 466 miles of earth/gravel roads.

The chief ports of the Colony are Sandakan, Labuan, Tawau, Jesselton, Lahad Datu and Kudat. Nineteen shipping lines run services to
and from the Colony as well as numerous other miscellaneous chartered vessels loading timber at Labuan and east coast ports. A regular feeder service to all ports in the Colony, Brunei and Sarawak is maintained by a fleet of seven coastal steamers and numerous small craft under 50 tons. Almost 6,827,000 gross tons of shipping used the ports of the Colony in 1958 and the quantity of cargo handled was 1,254,676 tons.

Broadcasting

The North Borneo Broadcasting Service (Radio Sabah) was inaugurated in November, 1955, and a daily 8½-hour programme is transmitted in Chinese (Kuo-yu and Hakka), Malay, Kadazan and English. The 5 kW. HF. transmitter giving Colony-wide coverage and a 250 W. MF. transmitter serving the Jesselton area are located at Kepayan, five miles from Jesselton. There are approximately 11,000 wireless licence holders in the Colony.

Principal Occupations

The estimated numbers of persons engaged in 1958 in the principal fields of economic activity were as follows:

- Smallholding Agriculture: 90,000
- Rubber Production: 20,000
- Commerce: 12,000
- Government Services: 3,500
- Fishing: 6,000
- Timber: 10,000
- Coconut, Copra and Coconut oil production: 3,000
- Transport and Communications: 3,000
- Firewood and Cutch: 2,000
- Building: 2,000

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are rubber, coconuts, rice and hemp. A high grade cigar wrapper leaf is grown for export by one large estate and a coarse variety of tobacco is cultivated as a village industry. Extensive areas for the cultivation of cocoa and oil palms are in process of being opened up.

The estimated livestock population is: pigs 150,000; buffaloes 100,000; cattle 30,000; goats 30,000; ponies 4,000; poultry 4,500,000. A cattle farm, on co-operative lines, has been established.

The total output of timber in 1958 expressed in cubic feet quarter-girth round measurement was 32,027,506 cubic feet.

Investigations are being made into increasing fresh water fish production; 617 ponds have already been constructed and stocked, with promising results.

A geological survey is being undertaken by a team of experts to determine the mineral wealth of the country and a large oil company is prospecting for oil.

Trade

| Year | Imports $ million | Exports $ million |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1938 | 6·4              | 9·8               |
| 1954 | 74·3             | 77·2              |
| 1955 | 87·6             | 104·8             |
| 1956 | 117·4            | 120·9             |
| 1957 | 121·6            | 120·9             |
| 1958 | 128·5            | 130·4             |

Original sources of imports are difficult to state on account of the territory's dependence on supplies from the entrepôt markets of Singapore and Hong Kong. Similarly it is not possible to determine accurately the ultimate destination of all the Colony's exports.

During 1958 imports by countries of origin and exports by countries of destination were:

**Imports.**—U.K. accounted for 21·87%, other Commonwealth countries 19·54%, Foreign countries 58·59%.

**Exports.**—U.K. received 17·74%, other Commonwealth countries 27·90%, Foreign countries 54·36%.
