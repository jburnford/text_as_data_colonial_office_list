UGANDA

Area

The total area is approximately 93,981 square miles (Northern Province 28,898, Buganda 25,631, Eastern Province 25,607, Western Province 13,845) of which 13,689 square miles are water and swamp.

Population

The estimated total population of the Protectorate at 30th June, 1959 was 5,868,200.

The total non-African population as shown by the 1959 census was 87,058, made up as follows:

- Indians: 63,130
- Pakistanis: 5,973
- Goans: 2,830
- Arabs: 1,946
- Europeans: 10,866
- Others: 2,313

The total African population in 1948 was 4,917,555. The results of the census taken in August 1959 are not yet available.

Principal Towns

The principal towns are Entebbe (seat of the Governor and the Central Government, population about 11,000), Kampala (commercial capital, population nearing 60,000), Jinja (population over 25,000), Mbale and Masaka. Administrative and trading centres also exist at Tororo, Soroti, Lira, Gulu, Arua, Moroto, Kitgum, Moyo, Fort Portal, Masindi, Hoima, Mbarara, Kabale and Mubende, and there are many other smaller towns and trading centres throughout the Territory.

Geographical Features

The equator passes through Lake Victoria about three miles south of Entebbe and through south-western Uganda to Lake George. The Protectorate forms part of the Central African tableland and the elevation varies from about 3,700 feet at Lake Victoria to 6,400 feet at Kabale in south-western Uganda, but descends to 2,030 feet at Lake Albert and below 2,000 feet in the valley of the Albert Nile. There are two mountain ranges, the Mufumbiro or Birunga range of volcanoes in south-west Uganda and the Congo, the highest peak being Muhavura (13,540 feet) and the Ruwenzori range, 60 miles in length, of which Mount Stanley with its twin peaks Margherita (16,763 feet) and Alexandra (16,703 feet) is the highest point. On the Uganda-Kenya border is Mount Elgon (14,178 feet) and 45 miles north of it Mount Debasiien (10,074 feet). The southern border of Uganda with Tanganyika runs across the middle of Lake Victoria. Other large lakes in the Protectorate are Lakes George and Edward in the south-west, Lake Albert in the west and Lake Kyoga. The Nile, which flows out of Lake Victoria at Jinja, meanders as far as Lake Albert under the name of the Victoria Nile and thereafter flows north out of Lake Albert as the Albert Nile. Other main rivers are the Katonga-Mpanga, the Aswa and the Malawa. The total area of forest is approximately 2,900 square miles. There are also large areas of open savannah woodland.

Climate

The average temperature over most of the Protectorate is between 70°F. and 75°F. but is lower in the highlands of the west and south-west. In the Entebbe/Kampala area (approximately 3,700 feet above sea level) the mean annual temperature is 71°F., the mean maximum and mean minimum temperatures are 79°F. and 63°F. respectively. The average rainfall varies from 30 to 60 inches according to the area. The rainy seasons are not clearly defined and vary from one long season from April to September in the extreme north to two seasons March to May and September to November at the Equator.

History

In 1862 Speke and Grant were the first Europeans to reach the capital of Mutesa, the ruler of Buganda, not far from the present Kampala. They passed on to the Sudan and Egypt and so solved the problem of the ages, the source of the Nile. Samuel Baker discovered Lake Albert in 1864. In 1875 Stanley visited Uganda and told the Christian world of the openings for missionary enterprise in Mutesa's dominions. The first English Protestant missionaries arrived in 1877, followed by French Roman Catholics in 1879. Following the death of Mutesa in 1884 and the accession of his son Mwanga, there was a series of internal uprisings in the kingdom which included rebellions against Mwanga himself and wars between the religious factions.

In 1888 control of the British sphere in East Africa had been assigned by Royal Charter to the Imperial British East Africa Company and when the Anglo-German Agreement of 1890 confirmed the inclusion in the British sphere of present-day Kenya and Uganda, Captain (later Lord) Lugard was despatched to establish the Company's influence in Uganda. Owing to the heavy costs of occupation, however, the Company soon gave notice of its intention to evacuate Uganda and Sir Gerald Portal was despatched to Uganda as Imperial Commissioner to make proposals for its future. As a result a Protectorate, over Mwanga's kingdom only, was formally established from 18th June, 1894.

Meanwhile, Bunyoro had been conquered and its ruler Kabarega driven out by a combined force of Sudanese troops (led by British officers) and the Buganda tribal army. In 1896 the Protectorate was extended to most of the other regions which are now included within the present Uganda and this term was thereafter applied to the whole territory; while Mwanga's kingdom (which is the present Buganda province) was referred to as Buganda. A revolt of the Sudanese troops in 1897 threatened the very existence of the Protectorate, but the position was restored with the help of Indian troops.

In 1899 Sir Harry Johnston was sent out by the British Government as Special Commissioner and in 1900 concluded the Agreement with the Kabaka, Daudi Chwa, and people of Buganda which laid down the principles governing administrative relations with the Crown. Agreements were also made in 1900 with the ruler and chiefs of Toro and in 1901 with the ruler and chiefs of Ankole. Administration was thereafter extended gradually over the more primitive and unorganized tribes, and the same principles of "indirect rule" were followed wherever and whenever it was possible. In 1902 the eastern highlands of the Protectorate together with the Kavirondo country were transferred to what is now Kenya Colony and the succeeding years saw further adjustments of the frontiers with the Sudan, Belgian Congo and what is now Tanganyika Territory. In 1905 the superintendence of the Protectorate's affairs passed from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office.
Constitution

The Uganda Order in Council, 1920, provided that there should be an Executive Council and a Legislative Council, consisting of such persons as might be directed by Royal Instructions.

Changes in structure of both Councils were approved by the Secretary of State in July, 1955. By these changes Executive Council consists of 13 members (10 of whom are Ministers), and the Governor as President.

The Legislative Council consists of 62 members and is presided over by a Speaker. The members are made up of 3 ex officio members, 14 other Government ministers and officials, and 15 nominated members on the Government Backbench; the remaining 30 are representative members of whom six are European, six are Asian, and 18 are African. Arrangements were made in 1958 for direct elections of African Representative members to be held on the basis of a qualitative franchise in all Districts that wanted them, with the exception of Karamoja. Ten African Representative members were returned in the nine Districts which accepted the arrangements.

The Protectorate is divided into four provinces, Eastern, Western and Northern, and Buganda, which is on a different footing from the others owing to the terms of the Uganda Agreement of 1900 and the Buganda Agreement, 1955, by which its form of Government is largely controlled. Buganda is ruled by the Kabaka, acting as a constitutional ruler, with the advice of six Ministers. A hierarchy of appointed chiefs are the executive officers of government. The Great Lukiko (i.e. the council of Buganda) contains 89 members of whom 40 are elected indirectly and 20 are elected by the county councils.

In the Eastern, Western and Northern provinces African Administrations have been established under the African Local Governments Ordinance 1949 and the District Administration (District Councils) Ordinance 1955, with district councils as the most important organs. Most of these councils have a majority of members who are elected, either directly or through lower councils. The latter have been established in most districts at parish, sub-county and county levels; they have as yet few specific functions. All District Councils have as their principal executive officers elected or appointed Secretaries-General and Treasurers, and in all districts there is a hierarchy of appointed chiefs as the executive officers of local government. In the Agreement districts of Toro, Ankole and Bunyoro there are traditional hereditary Rulers whose positions are defined in the Agreements.

Land Policy

Approximately 10,000 square miles of land is registered as being in private ownership of Africans, mainly in Buganda and Western Province. Approximately 440 square miles is in non-African hands. The remainder of the land in the Territory is vested in the Crown in trust for the use and benefit of the African population. In townships and in Buganda province Africans may only occupy such land in accordance with a lease or licence; elsewhere they may occupy it without lease or licence according to native custom. It is Government's policy to issue freehold titles to Africans occupying Crown land by native custom where the demand for such titles is shown to exist. No further grants in freehold are made to non-Africans, and alienations by lease are given only after consultation with the African Local Government concerned. African-owned land may not be transferred to non-Africans without the consent of the Minister of Lands and Mineral Development.

Taxation

The five main categories of taxation are income tax, poll tax, export taxes, stamp duties, and Customs and excise duties.

Income Tax is charged on incomes accruing in, derived from or received in East Africa by residents after any personal allowances have been deducted, and similarly on the incomes of non-residents. There is provision for double taxation relief between Uganda and the United Kingdom, Canada, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Denmark and Sweden. Any person liable to pay African poll tax is exempt from paying income tax.

Poll Tax is levied on every able-bodied male African at the rate of Sh. 6/- per year throughout the Protectorate. An African Local Government Tax is levied by African Local Governments varying up to £20 according to district and capacity to pay. Non-African Poll Tax is levied at flat rates of £7 10/- on taxpayers whose income exceeds £200 per annum and £3 15/- on taxpayers with lower incomes. Females possessing an income of less than £150 per annum are exempt.

Export Taxes are levied on lint cotton, coffee and hides and skins on a sliding scale by value.

Companies Tax. The rate of Income Tax applicable to companies is Shs. 5/50 on every £ of income accrued in, derived from or received in the Protectorate. Non-resident companies are assessed on income accrued in or derived from the Protectorate. A special rate of Shs. 9/50 in the £ is charged on the undistributed profits of companies which are resident in the Protectorate and in which the public are not substantially interested. This rate applies to the total income of the company less an allowance of 32½% of the trading income and any dividends declared out of such profits.

Customs and Excise. The tariff is divided into ad valorem, specific and free goods. Ad valorem duties vary from 11½% to 60%, the latter assessment only applying to luxury goods such as perfume and toilet preparations. The basic rate of import duty is 22½% ad valorem. Excise duties are imposed on the following products manufactured in the Protectorate:—Sugar, cigarettes, cigars, manufactured tobacco, beer, spirits and matches.

**Development Plans**

Under a three-year Capital Expenditure Forecast published in 1959, development expenditure excluding capital development by corporations is envisaged amounting to £15,000,000 over the years 1959/60, 1960/61 and 1961/62. This sum is broken down into the following categories:

| Category                                                                 | £ million |

**Other Development**

The Uganda Development Corporation Limited was established by Government in 1952 with an authorized capital of £8,000,000 (£6,400,000 issued). The Corporation's purpose is to facilitate the industrial and economic development of the Protectorate by promoting and assisting in the financing, management or establishment of new undertakings wherever possible in conjunction with private enterprise and of schemes for the better organization, modernization or efficient carrying out of any undertaking. Its subsidiary companies are the Uganda Cement Industry Limited, Uganda Hotels Limited, Agricultural Enterprises Limited, Uganda Consolidated Properties Limited, the Uganda Metal Products and Enamelling Company Limited and Nyanza Textile Industries, Limited, which produces cloth from locally grown cotton.

The Corporation is associated in other enterprises engaged in the development of mining and manufactures. One of these, Kilembe Mines Limited, is producing copper from deposits in Western Uganda, and smelting it at Jinja prior to export. Another, Sukulu Mines Limited, has been formed to mine and process the mineral complex at Sukulu, near Tororo, which consists principally of apatite, magnetite, and pyrochlore.

The Uganda Credit and Savings Bank was established in 1950 to make available to Africans facilities for loans for agricultural and commercial purposes; initial capital was provided by the Uganda Government.

At 30th June 1958 deposits in the Savings Bank Section amounted to over £1,000,000, and the 465 outstanding loans to over £300,000. Seven Branches of the Bank, and six Agencies, have been established in up-country centres. The Bank also acts as agent in operating the African Loans Fund.
(for making loans to Africans whose creditworthiness relies more on guarantees by Local Governments than on the normal security required by the Bank) and the Revolving Loan Fund of the International Co-operation Administration.

The Uganda Electricity Board, a public utility corporation, is pressing forward with extensions to the distribution of electricity supplies which are obtained mainly from the Owen Falls Dam at Jinja where there is an installed capacity of 105,000 kW, and which is capable of expansion to provide 150,000 kW. It is estimated that there is an additional potential output of some 500,000 kW in the 19 mile stretch of the river Nile below Owen Falls, and even more than this amount on the reach of the Nile between Lake Kyoga and Lake Albert.

Education

At the end of 1958 there were 2,232 grant-aided primary schools (333,785 pupils) and 211 grant-aided secondary schools (22,351 pupils). The total number of un-aided schools was 3,135 with a total enrolment of 141,803. There are 37 Teacher Training Colleges with an enrolment of 4,147 students, and 99 technical and trade schools with total enrolment of 4,585.

The University College of East Africa is situated at Makerere (Kampala): it is an autonomous Institution catering for all the East African territories; since 1953 the College has, in special relationship with London University, awarded degrees to its students. In 1958 there were 823 students attending the College of whom 270 came from Uganda. In addition 387 Uganda students were in receipt of scholarships or bursaries from various sources, and were attending courses overseas in the United Kingdom, India, the United States of America, and elsewhere.

The total recurrent expenditure by the Protectorate Government on all types of education, in the financial year 1957–58 was £4,088,515. Capital expenditure totalled £576,525. Government expenditure in 1935 was £76,093.

Libraries and Museums, etc.

Makerere College has the largest library in East Africa, consisting of 46,000 volumes and 44,000 pamphlets and unbound parts, and is the territory's official deposit library. Kampala Municipal Council runs a public library in Kampala, and both the British Council and the United States Information Services also have libraries in Kampala. There is a British Council branch library in their Mbale regional office and a Uganda Literature and Libraries Service has been formed to encourage the establishment of libraries in other district Headquarters. The Uganda Museum (Kampala) was established fifty years ago, and displays mainly ethnographic and archaeological material.

Health

The commonest causes of illness are malaria, respiratory infections, diseases of the digestive system, trachoma, tropical ulcers and venereal disease.

Special attention is being paid to the control of tuberculosis and leprosy. Special wards are available for the treatment of tuberculosis cases at Mulago and nine district hospitals, but treatment is given to in-patients and out-patients at all district hospitals. During the year just over 2,000 new cases came under treatment for the first time. From widespread surveys it is estimated that the total number of lepers in the Protectorate is about 70,000. About 30,000 of these received treatment during the year. In addition to the five major leprosy centres run by the Missions, African Local Governments have established 73 treatment villages.

In addition to Mulago, which is the teaching hospital for Makerere College Medical School with 670 beds, the Department maintains 28 hospitals at the main centres giving a combined bed strength for all races of 3,245. In rural areas the African Local Governments, in conjunction with the Medical Department, maintain 175 Units with a bed strength of 2,382 of which 445 are reserved for maternity cases. Beds in Mission hospitals and dispensaries, industrial concerns, privately owned nursing homes, etc., amount to 2,758. The total number of beds throughout the Protectorate therefore amounts to 8,385, which gives a ratio of approximately 1·5 hospital beds per 1,000 of the population.

In 1958, 96,366 patients were admitted to Government hospitals, and 1,199,971 were treated as out-patients. In addition, 2,635,447 new cases were treated at dispensaries.

Expenditure on Medical and Health Services for the financial year 1957–58 was £1,674,877 compared with £148,907 in 1935.

Communications

At Entebbe there is a first-class international airport with a main runway capable of receiving all commercial aircraft now flying and those designed for the immediate future. The Airport is equipped with the latest navigational aids, and the safety services are of a high standard. The main trunk route operators use Entebbe, which has excellent flying weather throughout the year, and in addition charter companies and the Royal Air Force make technical stops. It is estimated that more than 84,000 passengers used the airport during 1958.

Secondary airfields are maintained by the Uganda Government at Kasese, Jinja, Tororo, Soroti, Lira, Gulu, Arua, Masindi, Mbarara and Moroto, the first seven of which are served on regular schedules by the East African Airways Corporation. The Trustees of the Uganda National Parks maintain a landing ground at Murchison Falls, serving the Murchison Falls Park.

The railways are under the control of the East African Railways and Harbours Administration (see under "East Africa High Commission").

The direct line from the coast runs westwards across the Protectorate through Tororo, Jinja and Kampala to Kasese near the Belgian Congo border. Another line northwards from Jinja connects at Namasagali with a regular steamer service on Lake Kyoga to Masindi Port. The Railways Administration operates a road transport service between Masindi Port and Butiaba on Lake Albert, and a steamer service on Lake Albert and the Nile between Butiaba and Nimule which is connected by motor road with Juba in the Sudan. Another steamer service operates between Butiaba and the Belgian Congo ports of Mahagi and Kasenyi on the west shore of Lake Albert. A through service is thus provided by the Railways Administration from Mombasa to the Sudan and the Belgian Congo. In addition
regular steamer services connect Port Bell, Entebbe and Bukakata on Lake Victoria with Kisumu and Tanganyika ports.

The Public Works Department maintains 606 miles of tarmac road and 2,383 miles of all-weather murram roads connecting the principal towns; the various African Local Governments between them maintain a further 4,418 miles of all-weather murram roads and 3,881 miles of lesser murram roads of variable standard.

Broadcasting

The Uganda Broadcasting Service commenced regular transmission on 1st March, 1954, and now broadcasts daily in English, Luganda, Luyoro, Lwo and Ateso and weekly in Runyankore, Lugbara and Hindustani. It operates on frequencies of 5,026 and 9,590 kc/s in the 60 and 31 metre bands respectively and also on 971 kc/s and 548 kc/s in the medium wave band. Each of the medium wave channels is powered by 2½ kW transmitters operating in parallel; the short wave channel is powered by a 7½ kW transmitter. The transmitters are situated at Bugolobi near Kampala. Permanent studios are situated in Kampala.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population of Uganda is engaged in agriculture or cattle-raising on their own account. The numbers of Africans employed as wage-earners in the principal industries and occupations in June 1958 were:

| Industry                                      | Number |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------|

| Education and Medical Services                | 19,121 |
| Other Services                                 | 17,170 |

Total ........................................... 228,399

The foregoing figures are based on a census covering all employers except domestic service and peasant agriculture. The estimated total numbers in employment, including domestic service and peasant agriculture, are 298,000 Africans, 10,000 Asians and 4,650 Europeans.

There are 22 registered trade unions with a total membership of 12,800 and 11 associations of employees with a total membership of 4,020. Joint staff committees or works councils have been introduced in 127 establishments covering some 101,000 employees.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are cotton, coffee (arabica and robusta), sugar, tea, tobacco, millets, maize, plantains, sweet potatoes, cassava and groundnuts. In 1958 about 89% of the total value of domestic exports came from cotton and coffee products.

The number of cattle sold in established markets in 1958 was 130,000, while the total number slaughtered for consumption exceeded 410,000. Hides and skins are an important export.

Exploitable forests consist almost entirely of hard-woods, but more than 6,000 acres of softwood timber plantations are being created annually. The greater part of the timber production is consumed in the Protectorate and in the adjoining East African territories, but a small and increasing proportion is exported mainly to Great Britain. During 1958 about 1½ million cubic feet of sawn timber of an estimated value of about £1,000,000 were produced and in 1959 the manufacture of plywood was commenced.

Copper is the chief metal produced, 10,966 tons of blister copper worth £2,065,335 being exported in 1958. Owing to decline in the metal price, production of wolfram has virtually ceased but quantities of tin, gold, beryl, columbite, galena and bismuth continue to be mined. Geological survey and prospecting for minerals generally is being pursued.

The fishing industry is of great importance to Uganda. The present production is approximately 52,000 tons of fish per year, worth over £2 million, and of this total 40,000 tons is consumed within the country, the remainder being exported to other East African Territories and the Belgian Congo.

The Uganda Cement Industry at Tororo has a capacity of 150,000 tons per annum, more than sufficient to meet local consumption of cement. The textile factory at Jinja produces cloth from locally grown cotton. Production is currently at the rate of 13 million yards of various types of cloth—greys, drills and dyes. In the 1958 season 130 cotton ginneries were operated. The coffee crop was handled by 12 coffee curing works. Seven hulleries, capable of bringing coffee to fair average quality standards, processed fixed quotas of the crop. A number of estate coffee factories processed the coffee grown on the larger estates. Twenty-four estate coffee factories owned by African associations of growers constituted to operate on co-operative principles also processed an increasing amount of coffee. Amongst other undertakings processing agricultural produce were two sugar factories, one tobacco-processing works and large numbers of maize mills and oil-expressing mills.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

Provision has been made by legislation for the organized marketing of cotton and coffee, the two main cash crops of the Protectorate. The Lint Marketing Board is responsible for the sale of the lint cotton and seed and the Coffee Marketing Board for the coffee crop (excepting the Bugisu arabica crop and the produce of estates and associations of African growers permitted to conduct their own sales). Producer prices are announced before the marketing season opens and it is also the practice to announce a minimum guaranteed price for cotton at planting time.

Co-operative development was given formal recognition by Government by the enactment of co-operative legislation in 1946 and the establishment of a Co-operative Department to assist and guide the growth of the movement. Since that time 1,549 societies have been registered, 15 of which are co-operative unions. Membership of the 1,534 primary societies was 147,421.

Eleven cotton ginneries are now owned by co-operative unions while two are leased from Government. In 1958 these ginneries produced 43,601 bales of lint cotton or 10-9% of the total baled production of the Protectorate.

The Bugisu Co-operative Union again marketed the whole of the Bugisu arabica coffee crop which amounted to 3,907 tons. Of the 12,300 tons of clean robusta coffee handled by co-operative unions, the Uganda Growers' Co-operative Union produced 6,679 tons at its factory in Kawempe, near Kampala, and the Masaka District Co-operative Union produced 3,474 tons.

The total turnover of co-operative societies in 1958 amounted to £5,051,507, and by the Unions amounted to £5,896,720.

The Cotton Price Assistance Fund stood at £16,400,000 at 30th June, 1959. The Coffee Price Assistance Fund, as at 31st October, 1958, stood at £12,045,000.
