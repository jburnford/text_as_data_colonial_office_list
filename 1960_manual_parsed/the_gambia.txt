THE GAMBIA

Area
The total area is 4,003 square miles (Colony 29 square miles, Protectorate 3,974 square miles). St. Mary's Island, with an area of about 2,500 acres of dry land, is included in the Colony area.

Population
The latest estimate of the total population is 265,200, composed as follows:

- Colony—Bathurst—21,000; Kombo St. Mary—7,800; Protectorate—236,400. There are also about 10,000 seasonal immigrants. The population of Bathurst is African except for a few hundred Europeans, Syrians and Lebanese. The main tribal groups in the Protectorate are:

| Approximate Nos. |
|------------------|
| Mandingo         | 97,000 |
| Fula (all tribal subdivisions) | 52,000 |
| Wolof            | 32,000 |
| Serahuli         | 19,000 |
| Jola             | 21,000 |
| Others (of less than 5,000 each) | 16,000 |

The Principal Towns are—

**Colony**
- Bathurst—capital; population 21,000.

**Protectorate**
- Western Division—Brikama.
- Lower River Division—Mansa Konko.
- MacCarthy Island Division—Georgetown.
- Upper River Division—Basse.

Population in the Protectorate is evenly distributed and there are no towns of over 3,000 inhabitants.

Geographical Features
The River Gambia, some 700 miles in length, flows into the Atlantic by a wide estuary which narrows to two and a half miles between Barra Point and the town of Bathurst on St. Mary's Island. There are 27 feet of water at the entrance of the river at low tide, and ocean-going steamers...
drawing not more than 17 feet can at present proceed without trouble to Kuntaur 150 miles up-river. There is no bar to the River Gambia. The Colony consists mainly of the Island of St. Mary, at the mouth of the River Gambia, the adjoining division of Kombo St. Mary and MacCarthy Island in the middle river. The Protectorate consists of strips of territory on either bank of the river, for most of their length no more than seven miles wide.

Climate

The Gambia has a long dry season, normally from November to May, which is pleasant with its low temperature and humidity, due to the effect of the harmattan. Rainfall is confined to the period from June to October and averages about 40 inches on the coast, decreasing inland. The dry season climate near the coast is better than in most places in British West Africa, with the exception, perhaps, of the Cameroons highlands. During the wet season, however, humidity increases and is higher on the coast. Up-river it is much hotter but less humid, especially during the period February to May, after which the heat gradually decreases, with a rapid increase of humidity.

History

The Gambia was discovered by the Portuguese in 1455 but they made no lasting settlement. Between 1588 and 1752 Royal Charters were granted to various English merchants to trade with it. French merchants also plied during that period but the right of trade was abandoned to England by France under the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 which guaranteed to the English their possession of Fort James and of the River Gambia, with the exception of a French factory established at Albreda on the north bank of the river. From 1807 to 1816 the general commerce between Great Britain and the Gambia fell off, in part due to the abolition of the slave trade. In 1816 a new settlement was founded on the Island of Banjul by English merchants from Senegal. Banjul was renamed St. Mary's and its town named after Lord Bathurst the then Secretary of State.

The settlement was subject to the Government of Sierra Leone and was annexed to that Colony by Act of Parliament in 1821. From 1816 to 1822 a Military Commandant, aided by a board of merchants called "The Settlement Court", administered the Government. From 1822 to 1829 the Commandant governed alone.

In December 1829, the Secretary of State appointed the first Lieutenant Governor "of the settlement of Bathurst and its dependencies in the Gambia". The laws of Sierra Leone remained in force but the Lieutenant Governor was not accountable to the Officer Administering the Government there.

In 1843 the Gambia was created an independent Colony with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils for the administration of its affairs.

By the charter of 1866 it became a portion of the West African Settlements and continued to be so under the charter of 1874 until it was made a separate Government in 1888.

MacCarthy Island was purchased in 1823; the Ceded Mile was granted by the King of Barra in 1826; and British Kombo was granted by the King of Kombo in the various cessions of 1840, 1850 and 1853. In 1897 the countries of Foni and Jarra, on the south bank of the river, came under British protection. Foreign Kombo was also annexed by the British Government and is now divided into North, South and Central Kombo.

The protectorate system of administration has been established since 1894 and extended from time to time by agreement with the different chiefs concerned until Ordinance No. 7 of 1902 was passed, providing fully for the government of the whole Protectorate, which is now divided into four Divisions and again into Districts. This ordinance has since been superseded by the Protectorate Ordinance, 1935. There is a Commissioner in charge of each Division and each District is under a District Head Chief.

Constitution

Following recommendations approved by the Secretary of State in 1953 a new constitution for the Colony and Protectorate of the Gambia was introduced in September 1954.

Under the Gambia (Constitution) Order in Council, 1954, the provisions of which apply both to the Colony and to the Protectorate, the Executive Council consists of four ex officio Members, one Official Member, and not less than six Appointed Members. The Executive Council thus has, for the first time, an unofficial majority. Of the Appointed Members, all of whom must be Elected or Nominated Unofficial Members of the Legislative Council, two have been appointed Ministers and assigned special responsibilities for:

(a) the submission to Executive Council of questions relating to matters within their respective portfolios,

(b) ensuring, in association with the appropriate public officer, that effect is given to decisions taken by the Governor in Executive Council relating to these matters, and

(c) conducting in the Legislative Council government business relating to matters within their respective portfolios.

The Governor attends and presides at meetings of the Executive Council: with certain specified exceptions the Governor is required to consult the Executive Council in the exercise of his powers, but may act in opposition to their advice if he deems it right so to do.

The Legislative Council consists of a Speaker, four ex officio Members, one Nominated Official Member, two Nominated Unofficial Members, and fourteen Elected Members of whom four are directly elected to represent Bathurst and Kombo St. Mary, seven are indirectly elected to represent the Protectorate, and the remaining three are indirectly elected from a panel of names submitted by the Bathurst and Kombo St. Mary municipal councils. Meetings of the Council are normally presided over by the Speaker, but the Governor retains the right to attend any meeting and preside thereat. The usual legislative powers of the Council are subject to the Governor's reserve powers to legislate by
declaration if he considers it expedient so to do in the interests of public order, public faith or good government.

In September 1959 the Secretary of State accepted certain proposals for constitutional change put forward by the Governor. The salient features of these proposals are the adoption of universal adult suffrage throughout the territory, the enlargement of the Legislature, and provision for the appointment of up to six Ministers with or without portfolio.

Land Policy

Individual ownership of land is recognized in the Colony and there is no restriction on the acquisition of land by non-natives. Freehold interests in Crown lands are not disposed of except in special circumstances and with the sanction of the Secretary of State. A grant of Crown lands for a term of years may be made by the Governor. The normal term is 21 years with an option of renewal for a like term.

Land in the Protectorate is held on native customary tenure from the District Authority for the district in which it is vested. In general, land may not be alienated or leased to non-natives without the consent of the Governor. Except in a few cases, non-native occupation of land is confined to leases for not more than 21 years. Leases of small plots suitable for commercial or industrial purposes may be obtained from the District Authority for the district, with the approval of the Governor. The power to approve is delegated to the Senior Commissioner.

Taxation

There is a sliding scale of personal income tax which amounts to the following rates on chargeable incomes (incomes of single persons up to £200 a year and married persons up to £350 a year are free of tax, and there are additional allowances for dependants):

| Chargeable income | Average rate of tax in the £ |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| £400              | 6                           |
| £400              | 10                          |
| £400              | 26                          |
| £1,100            | 50                          |
| £8,000            | 100                         |
| £10,300           | 150                         |

The Company rate is 9s. in the £. There is no estate duty.

There is a direct tax on inhabitants of the Protectorate known as the District Rate which accrues to the District Treasuries. The rate at present in most areas is 30s. per "yard" of not more than four houses, though in some of the larger and more developed towns higher rates are being introduced. There are additional rates for lodgers in the "yard" and "strange farmers".

The other main form of taxation is the Customs tariff.

- Government Development Schemes £259,340
- Colonial Development and Welfare Schemes £181,955
- Colony's Farmers' Fund Schemes £70,132

The estimated total recurrent revenue for 1959 was £1,555,049 including the following main heads of revenue, viz:

- Customs £889,050

The Public Debt of the Gambia at the end of December 1958 amounted to £238,760, and the Sinking Fund to £64,641.

Currency

The currency in circulation is issued by the West African Currency Board in London on behalf of the British West African territories. It consists of notes of 100s., 20s. and 10s.; yellow metal alloy coins of 2s., 1s., 6d.; cupro-nickel coin of 3d.; bronze coins of 1d. and ½d. The currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

Development Plans

A total of £1,300,000 was originally made available under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945. Of this sum £800,000 was for services (medical, agricultural, veterinary and educational) including capital expenditure on buildings and plant; £500,000 was for the development of Bathurst and the Kombo.

The major capital works which will remain as monuments of the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1945 are:

(i) A new hospital in Bathurst.
(ii) A new town drainage system.
(iii) 400 acres of adjacent reclaimed land which was formerly swamp.
(iv) A new urban water supply.
(v) New schools.
(vi) New health centres and rural dispensaries.
(vii) New veterinary headquarters.
(viii) New paved streets in Bathurst.
(ix) New quarters for meteorological and airport staff.
(x) Armitage School, Georgetown.
(xi) Oyster Creek Bridge, length 720 ft.
(xii) Road Bridge at Pakali Ba, 100 ft. span.
(xiii) New High School Science Block, Bathurst.
Other schemes include research into pest infestation, veterinary and agricultural improvement, the Gambia Rice Farm, experimental work on bilharzia, sociological research, and reconstruction of roads in the Protectorate to an all-weather standard.

Gambia's initial territorial allocation under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1955 was £200,000. Its unspent balance from the previous development was approximately £600,000. It therefore had a total territorial allocation for 1955–60 of approximately £800,000, to which has been added the sum of £50,000 made as a supplementary allocation in 1957.

A programme of further development schemes for the Gambia within the funds now made available has been approved and provides for the continuation of uncompleted schemes and for new schemes, including road bridges at Brumen and Sami, new all-weather ferry terminals at Barra and Bathurst, new primary schools in Bathurst and Phase II of the New High School, Bathurst.

**Other Development**

A "Farmers' Fund" has been established from the profits of the Oilseeds Marketing Board. Besides meeting all the expenses of employing five Development Officers, it has enabled a number of schemes, chiefly of an agricultural nature, to be started. These schemes include expenditure on the opening up of new rice lands, fishing, communal gardens, group farming, ox-ploughing, village settlements, agricultural research, and animal pest control.

A programme of construction and improvement to rural water supplies continues, and over 200 wells of which approximately 70% are equipped with pumps have been completed. The construction of a further 200 wells is planned and where required washing slabs and cattle watering troughs are also provided. The reconstruction of 26 river wharves continues at a good pace, the arrival of new piling equipment having considerably accelerated progress. The planning of six permanent wharves is in hand. Both schemes are financed by the Farmers' Fund, the latter on equal share basis with government.

**Education**

Government is responsible for primary education in Bathurst, where there are 10 primary schools with a total enrolment of 3,329 pupils; most were formerly Mission Schools and are now administered by Management Committees on which the religious authority, Anglican, Methodist, Roman Catholic or Muslim, is represented. There are in addition two private schools (enrolment 245 pupils) run by the Methodist and Roman Catholic Missions as preparatory departments to their own High Schools.

In the rural area of the Colony there are Government Primary Schools at Bakau and Serekunda, and a grant-aided Roman Catholic Mission School at Kanifing: the total enrolment in these schools is 933 pupils.

There are 37 village primary schools in the Protectorate with 2,210 pupils; 25 of the schools are owned by the District Authorities and staffed in the main by Government teachers. The remaining schools are run by the Missions (10 Roman Catholic, 1 Anglican, 1 Methodist); the salaries of qualified teachers in these schools are reimbursed by Government.

Secondary education is concentrated mainly in Bathurst where there are three schools; the new Gambia High School is a mixed school which has absorbed the former Methodist Boys' and Girls' High Schools; the Roman Catholic Boys' and Girls' School continue as separate schools. Total enrolment in all schools is 388 boys and 235 girls. The new Government post-primary school at Crab Island has 538 pupils.

Armitage School, at Georgetown in MacCarthy Island Division, is a post-primary boarding school for Protectorate boys; it had 98 pupils in 1958, and work has continued on new buildings for the school, with the aim of increasing the enrolment to 240 pupils.

Yundum College, 15 miles from Bathurst, trains both men and women teachers for Government and the Missions; there is a three-year course, reduced to two years for School Certificate holders.

There are 44 Gambians overseas on Government scholarships, and over 100 private students, mostly in the United Kingdom.

Government expenditure on education in 1958 was £124,064 compared with £29,539 in 1948.

**Health**

The most common diseases are malaria, trypanosomiasis, ascariasis, yaws, bronchitis, leprosy and eye infections. The Health Services include special mosquito control units in Bathurst, Cape St. Mary and at Yundum Airport. Sanitary Inspectors are posted to important points in the Colony and Protectorate. The little-used Infectious Diseases Hospital, after renovation and repair, was opened as a Sanatorium in 1953 for treatment of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis.

Medical facilities in the Gambia are based on two general Hospitals, one at Bathurst and one at Bansang. The Victoria Hospital, Bathurst, serves the town and surrounding area, is equipped to deal with general medical and surgical cases, and has an obstetrical unit and an out-patients' department. Bansang Hospital in MacCarthy Island Division of the Protectorate caters for general medical and surgical cases, has a few beds for obstetrical cases, and an out-patients' department. In 1957, 5,444 in-patients and 43,349 out-patients were treated in these hospitals; the total number of out-patient attendances was 60,569.

There are 7 Health Centres, and Government dispensaries and sub-dispensaries are situated throughout the Protectorate. Total attendances in 1958 were 318,549.

Maternity and child welfare clinics are held at a centre in Bathurst, and at 20 health centres and dispensaries scattered throughout the country.

A UNICEF "Milk Scheme" commenced in 1956 under which Bathurst schoolchildren receive a daily ration of milk, sugar and vitamin capsules. Antenatal and Infant Welfare Clinics also issue milk and vitamin capsules to needy mothers.

A Leprosy Control Project sponsored by W.H.O. and U.N.I.C.E.F. was started in 1957 and by December 31st 1957, 705 patients were receiving D.D.S. tablets.

Government expenditure on Medical and Health Services in 1958 was £154,487 compared with £32,315 in 1935.
Communications

The international aerodrome is at Yundum, 17 miles from Bathurst. The Director of Public Works is also the controller of Civil Aviation and the airport control services are run on behalf of Government by International Aeradio Limited. The Public Works Department maintains runways, buildings and water supplies; mains and standby generator being the responsibility of the Electricity Department. Meteorological services are provided by a branch of the West African Meteorological Service. Scheduled return flights between Accra and Dakar calling at Ibadan, Robertsfield, Freetown and Bathurst are run by W.A.A.C. (Nigeria) twice a week and Ghana Airways, once a week. The latter service also calls at Conakry. Hunting Clan and Airwork Ltd. alternately run one return flight each week from London Airport and Gatwick respectively to Accra calling at Las Palmas (night stop) Bathurst and Freetown. It is planned to double this service.

There are approximately 730 miles of roads in the Gambia excluding district tracks and of this total only 75 miles are to an all-weather standard. A current five-year programme allows for the reconstruction of 256 miles to all-weather standard and the provision of bridges and culverts to British Standard Heavy Loading. Apart from bitumenizing Bathurst Streets, now well in hand, similar treatment is being accorded to main streets in the larger Protectorate trading centres.

The chief port, Bathurst, handled 51,262 tons of cargo in 1958. Services for passengers and cargo are provided by the Elder Dempster Lines and Palm Line and occasionally by John Holt and Company. River ports are used for the loading of some 46,000 tons of groundnuts into ocean-going shipping annually. The H.M.C.S. Lady Wright and the H.M.C.S. Fulladu maintain a weekly service between the main river ports from Bathurst to Basse, a distance of about 242 miles up the Gambia River. The two vessels carried in 1958 a total of 1,237 cabin passengers, 17,327 deck passengers and approximately 2,720 tons of cargo.

There are no railways.

Broadcasting

There is no wireless or wired broadcasting station in the Gambia. Domestic radio receivers operate without fee.

Principal Occupations

Most of the population is engaged in agriculture. The estimated numbers in other occupations are:

- Government Service ... 2,730
- Building ... 230
- Distributive Trades ... 1,720
- Shipping ... 250
- Others ... 1,320

There are five registered Trade Unions—Bathurst Trade Union, Gambia Labour Union, Gambia River Trade and Commercial Workers' Union, Gambia Workers' Union and Gambia Butchers' Union. Most have a membership of less than one hundred.

Main Crops and Products

The main crops are groundnuts, for export and oil production, rice, sorghum and millet; some maize and a little cotton for village weaving are also grown.

Alluvial deposits of ilmenite exist in the coastal districts of the Gambia. The concession is held by a subsidiary of a United Kingdom firm and mining is now in progress.

Preliminary investigations into the possibility of drilling for oil have been made with results which are not yet conclusive.

The estimated livestock population is: cattle 142,985; sheep 50,500; goats 75,500; pigs 2,600; horses 200; donkeys 4,300; poultry 227,100.

A fair amount of fish is caught in coastal waters and some in the lower river; very little, however, is done further up-river, though fish are fairly plentiful.

Co-operative and Marketing Organizations

The Gambia Oilseeds Marketing Board handles the export of all groundnuts and other oilseeds. Its aims are to ensure orderly marketing, to improve the quality of exports, and from its profits to finance schemes of research and development. A Cattle Marketing Board was set up in 1955. A Registrar of Co-operative Societies, an Assistant Registrar, a Trainee Assistant Registrar and six Inspectors have been appointed. There are at present 48 societies including 9 unregistered primaries and 3 unregistered secondaries with a total membership of 3,188.
