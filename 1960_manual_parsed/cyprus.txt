CYPRUS

The London Agreement of February, 1959, between the Governments of Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom and the leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities, provided for the establishment of an independent Republic of Cyprus by the 19th February, 1960, and for the retention of two base areas under United Kingdom sovereignty. It did not prove possible to complete the arrangements for implementing the Agreement by the 19th February, and at the request of the Cypriot leaders the date for the establishment of the Republic was postponed.

At the time of printing, negotiations between the parties were still in progress.

It is the intention that the two Sovereign Base Areas should be administered by the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East Air Force, who would be responsible to the Secretary of State for Air.
