FALKLAND ISLANDS AND DEPENDENCIES

Area
The Falkland Islands, situated in the South Atlantic, lie some 480 miles north-east of Cape Horn. The numerous islands of which they are composed cover 4,618 square miles. There are two groups of Dependencies: (a) South Georgia, 800 miles to the east of the Falklands, together with South Orkney and South Sandwich, which lie 550 miles to the south-west and 470 south-east respectively of South Georgia; (b) South Shetland and Graham Land, the most northerly point of the former being some 500 miles south of the Falklands.

Population
A census was held on 31st March, 1953, and the population, excluding Dependencies, was 2,230, there being rather more males than females. All were of European descent and most were British. At 31st December, 1958, the population was estimated at 2,238. The population of the Dependencies is estimated at 1,300 in the summer whaling season, with rather less than half that number during the winter.

Principal Town
Stanley, the capital (population 1,135 at 1953 census), is the only town. In the Camp, the countryside other than Stanley, the largest settlement is at Darwin where there are some 100 residents.

Geographical Features
There are two large islands, the East and West Falklands, and numerous smaller islands. The coastline is deeply indented and affords several good anchorages. The surface everywhere, except in Lafonia, is hilly, the maximum height being reached in the West Falkland where Mount Adam rises to 2,315 feet. There are no large inland waters. A feature of the treeless, moorland scenery is the "stone runs," long "rivers" of angular, quartzite boulders. The island of South Georgia in the Dependencies is a mass of high mountains which are covered with deep snow where they are not too precipitous, and the valleys between are filled with glaciers which in many cases descend to the sea.

Climate
The islands are in the same latitude south as London is north but, apart from hours of sunshine which are almost identical, there is little similarity of climate. The islands are frequently, and in summer particularly, swept by high winds which some people from the United Kingdom find trying. The average winter and summer temperatures are a good deal lower than Kew. The climatic figures for Stanley are:

- Mean annual temperature: 43°
- Mean annual maximum: 70°
- Mean annual minimum: 19°
- Mean annual wind speed: 15 knots.
- Mean annual rainfall: 30 inches.

The Dependencies have a rigorous climate of Antarctic character.

History
The Falklands are said to have been discovered by Davis in 1592 and were evidently visited by Hawkins in 1594. On the other hand it is claimed
by some historians that Vespucci sighted the Falklands in 1502. In 1764 de Bougainville established a small colony at Port Louis in the East Falkland. This French settlement was handed over to Spain in 1767 on the payment of a sum said to have amounted to £24,000. In 1765 Captain Byron took possession of the West Falkland and left a small garrison at Port Egmont on Saunders Island, whence it was driven out by the Spaniards in 1770. This action on the part of Spain brought that country and Britain to the verge of war. The Spaniards restored the settlement to the British in 1771, but it was abandoned in 1774. The Spaniards also abandoned their settlement at Soledad (Port Louis) in the early nineteenth century.

In 1820 the Captaincy-General of Buenos Aires established a settlement at Soledad which was destroyed in 1831 by the U.S. warship Lexington as a reprisal for interference with American sealers.

In 1833 the occupation of the Islands was resumed by the British Government. In 1841 a civil Lieutenant-Governor was appointed, who took over the following year from the naval officer then in charge of the Islands. In 1843 an Act of Parliament placed the civil administration on a permanent footing and the Lieutenant-Governor's title was changed to Governor. In 1844, following a decision taken the previous year, the seat of government was removed from Port Louis to Fort William, where the settlement was named Stanley.

A grant-in-aid of the Colony was approved in 1841 and continued until 1880. A grant-in-aid for a mail service continued until 1884–85, since which year the Colony has been self-supporting. The development of the Colony has been closely linked with the growth of the Falkland Islands Company, the largest landowner and trading company, formed in 1851.

Of the Dependencies South Georgia was probably discovered by the London merchant de la Roché in 1675 and formally annexed in 1775 by Captain Cook who in the same year discovered and took possession of the South Sandwich group. South Shetland was discovered and taken possession of by Captain W. Smith in 1819 and South Orkney by Captain G. Powell in 1821. Graham Land was discovered by Edward Bransfield, R.N., in 1820 and taken possession of for Great Britain by John Biscoe in 1832.

There has been a Government Station at South Georgia since 1909 and during the time that Deception Island had an active shore whaling station (i.e. from 1906 to 1931) a magistrate was in permanent residence during the summer months. In the 1943–44 season under the code name of "Operation Tabarin" the first of what are now known as Falkland Islands Dependencies Bases were established at Deception Island and Port Lockroy. Since that time occupation of Bases has been continuous and the number so occupied now stands at ten. Their locations are as follows:

Base A—Port Lockroy, Wienke Island, Palmer Archipelago.
Base B—Deception Island, South Shetlands.
Base D—Hope Bay, Trinity Peninsula, Graham Land.
(Base V, View Point, Duse Bay, is a subsidiary station of Base D and is manned periodically by sledging parties in transit)

Base E—Stonington Island, Marguerite Bay, Graham Land.
Base F—Argentine Islands, West coast of Graham Land.
Base G—Admiralty Bay, King George Island, South Shetlands.
Base H—Signy Island, South Orkneys.
Base T—Adelaide Island, Graham Land.
Base Y—Horseshoe Island, Marguerite Bay, Graham Land.
Base Z—Halley Bay.

Other bases which have been established, but are at present unoccupied, are as follows:
Base C—Cape Geddes, Laurie Island, South Orkneys.
Base J—Prospect Point, Graham Coast.
Base N—Anvers Island, Palmer Archipelago.
Base O—Danco Coast, Graham Land.
Base W—Loubet Coast, Graham Land.

**Constitution**

The Government is administered by a Governor aided by an Executive Council which is composed of three *ex officio* members, and four nominated unofficial members; and a Legislative Council composed of three *ex officio*, four elected, two nominated unofficial and two nominated official members. The present Constitution became effective on 1st January, 1949.

There is a Town Council for Stanley.

**Land Policy**

All the land is held freehold and mostly by a very few large farms. Certain areas are Crown reserves.

**Taxation**

Direct taxation is in the form of income tax, individuals paying a graduated tax ranging from 1s. in every £ of the first £100 of taxable income to 3s. 6d. in every £ exceeding £950. Companies pay a flat rate of 3s. 6d. in the £. Arrangements have been concluded with the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and the United States of America for the avoidance of double taxation.

There is no general Customs tariff, import duties being confined to liquor, tobacco and matches. Export duties are levied on wool, tallow, guano, hides and skins, and whale and seal oil.

(a) Includes H.M.G. grants.
(b) Revised Estimate.
In 1958-59 the main sources of revenue for the Colony were: Customs £55,431, Internal Revenue £128,261, Posts and Telegraphs £14,835, Interest £21,718; and the main heads of expenditure were: Special £38,486, Public Works £30,872, Medical £26,074, Aviation £14,024, Posts and Telegraphs £39,173, Passages under Head Miscellaneous £18,577, Secretariat and Treasury £15,813, Education £32,375.

In 1958-59 the revised estimate of revenue from the Dependencies was:

| Source                                      | Estimate (£) |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Customs and Port Dues                       | 129,145      |
| Internal Revenue, Fees and Rents            | 55,724       |
| Post Office and Wireless Telegraphy Service | 7,968        |
| Miscellaneous                               | 20,223       |

In addition the sum of £258,690 was expected to be received from Her Majesty's Government as a contribution towards the cost of running the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey Antarctic Bases and ships (including International Geophysical Year activities).

For the same period the revised estimate of the cost of maintaining the South Georgia Administration was £71,480, Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (including ships) £481,505 and the Air Survey £566.

**Currency**

The currency is British coinage and local £5, £1 and 10s. notes which are interchangeable with sterling at par.

**Development**

Work on the rehabilitation and improvement of the Stanley roads, commenced in 1956 and financed partly by funds provided under the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts of 1945 and 1955 and partly from Colony funds, is expected to take until 1962 to complete.

Up to the end of June, 1959, expenditure on the roads totalled £61,492 of which £34,000 was provided from Colonial Development and Welfare funds and £27,492 from Colony reserves. A further £60,000 is estimated to be required to complete the work.

**Education**

In 1958 there were 317 children receiving education in the Colony. There is no system of higher education and no advanced secondary education. In Stanley the Government schools cater adequately for children between the ages of five and fourteen, though a number stay until their sixteenth year and, in some subjects, reach General Certificate of Education standard. Outside Stanley, education is carried on either in settlement schools, some of which are very small, or by itinerant teachers. A new boarding school was opened in 1956 at Darwin on the East Falkland, with 40 pupils (11 day pupils). Attendance at school in the Camp is compulsory where there is a settlement school or where a travelling teacher calls. In 1958 a maximum of six travelling teachers were employed among the 170 children outside Stanley, but, owing to the remoteness of some houses, there were about 1·2% of Camp children receiving no education at all.

The Colony awards up to two scholarships annually to boarding grammar schools in Dorset, tenable by children with primarily Falkland Islands parents. Four scholars are in England at present.

The cost of education in 1958-59 was £32,375 compared with £2,877 in 1935.

**Libraries**

There is one lending library in Stanley operated by the Town Council.

**Health**

The commoner ailments in the Colony are the common cold, naso-pharyngitis, bronchitis, gastro-enteritis and rheumatism in its chronic form. The incidence of tuberculosis is higher than in the United Kingdom.

There is one General Hospital in Stanley. An extension to the hospital, the Churchill Wing, was completed in 1953. The Colony now has a modern, well-equipped hospital, with 32 beds.

The Government Medical Department employs one Senior Medical Officer and three Medical Officers, one of whom is in Stanley, one at Darwin, in Lafonia, and the third at Fox Bay, in the West Falkland. A Tuberculosis Officer was employed from September 1953 to November 1954 on a tuberculosis survey of the Falklands. The nursing staff of the Hospital consists of the Matron, four Nursing Sisters and six Nurses.

There are two Government-employed dentists in the Colony. One is stationed in Stanley, the other works wholly in the Camp.

The Government Air Service is used extensively for medical transport to and from Stanley. The m.v. *Philomel* is also at the disposal of the Medical Department for use when the weather does not permit the use of the aircraft.

Expenditure on the Medical Department in 1958-59 was £26,074. In 1935 the sum spent was £5,225.

**Communications**

Communication between the Colony and the mainland of South America is maintained by the Falkland Islands Company's vessel R.M.S. *Darwin*, which runs a mail and passenger service at least 12 times a year to Montevideo. Internal communications are maintained by sea with the Government-owned *Philomel*, the *Darwin* and a few small private vessels. There is also a small Government-owned air service. Travellers generally use horses when moving from one settlement to another on the mainland. South Georgia is served by vessels engaged in the whaling industry and the Royal Research Ships *John Biscoe* and *Shackleton* call there and elsewhere in the Dependencies during the southern summer. There are no roads, except in Stanley, and no inland waterway or rail service.

**Broadcasting**

The Government runs a broadcasting station at Stanley, operating on 585 and 3,958 kc/s, with a power of 5 kW and 500 watts respectively. In 1958 there were 471 wireless licence holders in the Colony. Government also operates a wired broadcasting service in Stanley which in 1958 had 325 subscribers. There is also a Government wireless station on the West Falkland to which most of the farms are linked by telephone. The East Falkland has telephone facilities similar to those on the West. Government operates an inter-island radio-telephone service and daily communication is maintained with Stanley.
Principal Occupations

In the Camp the main occupation is sheep-farming. In Stanley the population is employed on Government and public services, trading and shipping. The population is almost equally divided between Stanley and the Camp. Local labour is organized in the Falkland Islands Labour Federation which has a 90% membership of eligible labour.

Main Crops and Products

There is no agriculture in the Colony other than a very small acreage of oats grown for hay. Householders in Stanley and the Camp grow their own vegetables. There are no minerals and the only manufactured product is a small quantity of tallow. The principal products are wool, whale meal, whale oil, other whale products and seal oil.
