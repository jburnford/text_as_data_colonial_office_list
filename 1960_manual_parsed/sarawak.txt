Principal Towns

| Town          | Approximate Population |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Kuching (capital) | 58,000                |
| Sibu          | 35,000                 |

Miri was almost entirely destroyed as a result of the war but reconstruction has now been completed.

Geographical Features

The Colony consists of a coastal strip some 450 miles long and varying from 40 to 120 miles wide on the north-west coast of the island of Borneo. A broken range of mountains runs south-west through the middle of the island, and Sarawak lies between this range and the sea. The southern border with West, or Indonesian, Borneo, is formed by another range of mountains running westerly from about the centre of the main range. The country is divided into three main zones. Firstly, an alluvial and swampy coastal plain in which isolated mountains and mountain groups rise to 2,000 feet or more, then rolling country of yellow sandy clay intersected by ranges of mountains, and finally a mountainous area in the interior. The highest peak is Murud, 7,950 feet. The Rejang (350 miles long) and Sarawak Rivers are navigable for ocean-going ships for 170 and 22 miles respectively. Others are navigable by coastal steamers or launches. Most of the rivers have shallow bars which limit the size of the vessels entering. On the Trusun, Limbang, Baram and Rejang Rivers, gorges and dangerous rapids occur well below the sources. Lowland tropical rain forest covers approximately 34,000 square miles, or 72% of the land area of the Colony. Much of this forest is inaccessible until the internal communications of the country can be improved.

Climate

The climate is humid, day temperatures averaging 85°. October to March is the season of the northeast monsoon, with the heaviest rains, strong winds and high seas. Except for a transitional month, the remainder of the year has less rainfall, with occasional droughts lasting up to three weeks. In the coastal area from Miri to Labuan most of the rainfall is between midnight and dawn. The average annual rainfall varies from 100 to 180 inches.

History

The history of Sarawak as an integral State begins with the first landing of James Brooke in 1839. At that time Sarawak was the southern
province of the Brunei Sultanate. The oppression of the Sultan's viceroy, Makota, had goaded Malays and Land Dayaks into revolt. James Brooke interceded in the dispute, brought about a settlement and was rewarded for his services by being installed in 1841 as Rajah of the territory from Cape Datu to the Samarahan River. Thereafter Rajah Brooke devoted himself to the suppression of piracy and head-hunting, often with the assistance of ships of the Royal Navy, which performed almost incredible feats of navigation and endurance. Sarawak was recognized as an independent State by the United States of America in 1850, and by Great Britain in 1864. In 1861 the territory of Sarawak was enlarged by the Sultan's cession of all rivers and lands from the Sadong River to Kidurong Point.

At his death in 1868, Sir James Brooke bequeathed to his nephew and successor, Charles Brooke, a country paternally governed, with a solid foundation of mutual trust and affection between ruler and ruled. In 1882 the frontier was advanced beyond the Baram River. In 1885 the valley of the Trusan River was ceded and in 1890 the Limbang River was annexed at the request of the inhabitants. In 1905 the Lawas River area was purchased from the British North Borneo Company, with the consent of the British Government. British protection was accorded to Sarawak in 1888.

The third Rajah, Sir Charles Vyner Brooke, succeeded his father in 1917, and progress continued in all spheres. In 1941, the centenary year of Brooke rule, the State was in a sound economic position with large reserves. To celebrate the centenary, the Rajah enacted a new constitution, and set his people on the first stage of the road to democratic self-government.

During the Japanese occupation, social services and communications were neglected; education ceased; health precautions were ignored; sickness and malnutrition spread throughout the State. After the surrender of Japan, the Australian forces entered Kuching on the 11th September, 1945, and Sarawak was for seven months administered by a British Military Administration, as a result of whose efforts supplies of essential commodities were distributed, the constabulary re-formed and the medical and educational services reorganized. The Rajah resumed the administration of the State on the 15th April, 1946. It was, however, evident to him that greater resources and more technical and scientific experience were needed to restore to Sarawak her former prosperity. He therefore decided to hand the country over to the British Crown, and a Bill to this effect was introduced into the Council Negri in May 1946 and passed by a small majority. By an Order in Council the State became a British Colony on the 1st July, 1946.

**Constitution**

A new Constitution was granted to Sarawak by the Sarawak (Constitution) Orders in Council, 1956, which were brought into force in 1957. Under this Constitution the Council Negri (i.e. the legislature) consists of twenty-four Elected Members, not more than fourteen *ex officio* Members, four Nominated Members and two Standing Members (who were appointed for life by His Highness the Rajah before Cession). The Supreme Council (i.e. the Executive Council) consists of five Elected Members (elected by the Elected Members of the Council Negri from amongst its Elected, Nominated and Standing Members by secret ballot), three *ex officio* Members and two Nominated Members. The Council Negri Elections Ordinance, 1956, provides for Electoral Colleges and Sub-Electoral Colleges. The Electoral Colleges are the five Divisional Advisory Councils, the Kuching Municipal Council, the Sibu Urban District Council and the Miri Urban District Council.

The new Constitution replaces the Constitution granted by His Highness the Rajah in 1941, as amended by the Sarawak Letters Patent, 1946.

**Land Policy**

All land in Sarawak is classified under one of the following headings: mixed zone land, native area land, native customary land, interior area land or reserved land. Only mixed zone land may be alienated under title to a person who is not a native of Sarawak. Native area land may be held under title only by a native of Sarawak and may not be occupied by a non-native.

Native customary land is land over which a native of Sarawak has established native customary rights of user by planting a crop or otherwise making use of vacant and unclaimed land. Native customary land is held under right of user only and may be part of an area classified as mixed zone land, native area land or interior area land. Before native customary land can be alienated native customary rights must be surrendered or extinguished, or provision made for compensating the holders of the right. Native customary rights may be transferred by inheritance but not otherwise. Native customary land is farmed generally under a bush fallow system with 6 to 15 years between crops, although small scattered areas are under mixed fruit or rubber.

Interior area land is generally situated well away from the main centres and lines of communication, and may not be held under title. Native customary rights may be established over interior area land only under permit from the District Officer.

Most of the alienated land is held by small holders, although there are a few holdings of 500 acres or more. Government policy is to encourage smallholders to own their land. Land utilization surveys are being carried out to assess land available for agricultural development and, where possible, planned settlement schemes are being introduced.

The Land Code, combining and revising all previous legislation except that dealing with subdivision of urban land, was enacted in 1957 and came into effect on 1st January, 1958.

**Taxation**

The only direct taxes levied on the native population by Government are the Dayak "door tax" of $1 per family per year, and the Malay "head tax" of $1 per year which is levied on all males of working age. These taxes are transferred to local authorities, where existent, who may in certain circumstances levy a cess of a similar amount on other indigenous races. Where a Local Authority imposes a general purpose rate on all premises within its area of jurisdiction, persons living in such premises are exempted from these taxes.

Income tax at the rate of 30% on every $ of the chargeable income is levied on every company incorporated or registered under any law or charter in force in Sarawak or elsewhere. There is no personal income tax at present.
Public Finance

| Year | Revenue ($) | Expenditure ($) |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1938 | 4,261,899   | 4,272,140       |
| 1954 | 43,800,621  | 33,264,706      |
| 1955 | 49,774,861  | 34,431,606      |
| 1956 | 51,434,042  | 43,374,437      |
| 1957 | 52,163,917  | 50,587,351      |
| 1958 | 60,045,667  | 57,957,444      |

The main heads of revenue and expenditure in 1958 were:
Revenue derived from Customs import and export duties $26,648,490; Licences, Taxes and Internal Revenue other than Income Tax $3,637,662; Interest on Investments $2,922,481; Income Tax $12,094,387; Expenditure—Contribution to Development Fund $10,228,662; Constabulary $3,961,864; Education $8,745,261; Medical $5,192,820; Administration $2,805,899; Lands and Surveys $2,249,387; Public Works $5,279,907.

Public Debt

Debenture Bonds to the value of $1,529,410 at $10·00 each were issued in 1958. These bonds will be redeemed over a period of ten years commencing in June, 1959; each year one-tenth of the bonds will be drawn for redemption and will be redeemed at the price of $14·00 each.

Currency

The legal tender of Sarawak is currency issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo. By virtue of the Currency Ordinance, 1951, and Proclamation of November, 1952, Sarawak currency ceased to be legal tender with effect from 31st December, 1952. These notes and coins may be exchanged, as an act of grace, for an equivalent amount of currency issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo, at any Sarawak Government Treasury.

The value of the Malayan dollar is 2s. 4d. sterling.

Development Plans

A new 1959–1963 Development Plan was approved in August 1959. This new plan is an extension of the 1955–60 plan and allows for a two-year overlap. The plan is to be financed by Colonial Development and Welfare grants, local revenue appropriations, accumulated surplus balances, rubber cess and loan funds. The total projected expenditure of $114,945,608 is divided as follows:

| Category          | Expenditure ($) |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Agriculture       | 30,855,154      |
| Forestry          | 204,900         |
| Communications    | 41,123,097      |
| Fuel and Power    | 2,600,000       |
| Education         | 11,671,403      |
| Medical and Health| 7,373,600       |
| Water Supplies    | 9,063,830       |
| Miscellaneous     | 12,053,624      |

The aims and objects of the Plan are to develop the economy of Sarawak and to improve and expand social services within the capabilities of the country to meet the resulting increase in operating cost. Sarawak’s economy depends mainly on agricultural exports, of which rubber is the most important. A considerable amount is included in the new Plan for the planting of high-yielding rubber which is the largest single scheme and which will be partly financed by the imposition of a 2 cents per lb. rubber cess. The provision for communications, which accounts for 35·8% of the Plan is to be spent on roads, port developments, aviation, waterways and telecommunications.

Other Development

Industrial development is mainly in the hands of private enterprise, notably the oil industry. In 1957 a Pioneer Industries (Encouragement) Ordinance and a Development Finance Corporation Ordinance were enacted to encourage and assist the establishment of new industries and local enterprise. The Government has spent a total of $155 million since 1947 on reconstruction and development.

Education

At the end of 1958 there were 794 schools in Sarawak, of which 38 provided secondary education. The number of children in school, which in 1947 was 29,616, had risen in 1958 to 90,932, of whom 82,216 were at the primary stage and 8,716 at the secondary stage. Of the total enrolment, 55,816 were Chinese pupils. Schools are under the management of Government, Local Authorities, Christian Missions, Committees of Management of Chinese Schools, and Village School Committees. There were 116 students studying overseas under various scholarship schemes on courses lasting not less than one year. Teacher-training is carried on at Batu Lintang, near Kuching, at a residential centre run by Government in co-operation with the Missions, and at Sibu in the Third Division. Expansion of educational services in the post-war years was largely made possible by the encouragement of “self-help” methods on the part of local communities, particularly with regard to the provision and maintenance of primary school buildings and furniture. As from 1st January, 1956, the central government assumed much greater financial responsibility for education. Under a new system of grants-in-aid, for which all schools under local authorities and voluntary agencies are eligible, approved recurrent expenditure in aided schools, after deducting revenue from fees at prescribed rates, is now met entirely from public funds. For approved capital expenditure, up to 50% of the cost may normally be met from public funds. The introduction of the new grants, coupled with the big rise in school enrolments and improvements in the terms of service of teachers, led to an increase in public expenditure on education from $1,576,000 (about £184,000) in 1955 to about $12,329,000 (£1,438,383) in 1958.

Libraries, Museums, etc.

The Sarawak Museum, at Kuching, is the only one in Borneo. Its research activities are largely concerned with the anthropology and ethnology of the country. Archaeological excavations are also in progress. The Reference Library is housed in the Museum buildings; there are also a lending library and reading room at Kuching and Sibu.

Health

Health and sanitation are good in the towns and in rural areas are improving very rapidly. A country-wide malaria eradication scheme is in operation and although there is still some malaria in certain places, this disease will soon be nonexistent in the country.
Beds available at Sarawak hospitals total about 1,666 (300 mental hospital, 520 leprosy settlement). A large new mental hospital has been built near Kuching. There is also a new hospital at Simanggang and considerable extensions to the hospital at Sibu.

Outside the main centres there are many static and travelling dispensaries. A typical static dispensary is in charge of a senior hospital assistant, and, as well as attending to very large numbers of out-patients, has about half a dozen "rest beds" for in-patients. A travelling dispensary is a small outboard motor-boat which travels on a more or less fixed itinerary along a river.

Maternity and child welfare services throughout the country are well advanced and in the town of Kuching, most births are attended in homes or hospitals by members of the Government medical department.

The expenditure of the Medical Department for the year 1958 was $5,192,820 for ordinary annual purposes and $1,749,729 from the development account for special work such as new building and the malaria eradication project.

Communications

There are two main airports, at Kuching and Sibu, and aerodromes at Bintulu, Lutong, Mukah, Marudi, Lawas, Sematan and Simanggang. Borneo Airways operate internal services and also externally to Brunei and North Borneo, linking up with the main line service. Malayan Airways Limited operate daily services in each direction between Singapore, Kuching and Sibu. Most of these services extend to Brunei and North Borneo centres.

Cathay Pacific Airways operate a weekly service to Kuching from Hong Kong via Labuan and North Borneo.

The sea and rivers remain the chief means of surface communication, although development of internal air services has recently been a feature of some importance. Work is progressing on various new road projects.

The total road mileage is about 557, consisting of 123 miles bitumen surfaced, 97 miles gravel surface and 337 miles dry-weather earth roads and tracks.

The Sarawak Steamship Company's M.V. Rajah Brooke and M.V. Auby provide a weekly passenger and cargo service between Kuching and Singapore and there is a further regular connexion between Sibu and Kuching and between Singapore and Rejang River ports by vessels of this company. Various local shipping companies, mainly Chinese, ply up and down the main rivers and between coastal ports on limited voyages with a variety of launches and small, timber-built, powered craft carrying passengers and cargo. The Norwegian vessels Hervar, Henrik and Hermelin, owned by the China Siam Line now provide a three monthly service between Kuching and Hong Kong mostly via British North Borneo ports. In 1959 a regular monthly service from Australia was begun by the Royal Intercoastal Line, and there are regular services to the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia and Hong Kong by vessels of various other lines.

The number and tonnage of overseas and neighbouring territories vessels calling at Sarawak ports (including vessels calling for timber, and oil tankers) in 1958 were: arrivals 3,487, tonnage 4,077,459; departures 3,471, tonnage 4,002,022 (whole Colony).

Broadcasting

The Sarawak Broadcasting service (Radio Sarawak) was inaugurated in 1954, and now broadcasts in English, Malay, Chinese and Iban for approximately 14 hours daily, on two short wave transmissions (7½ kW. and 5 kW.) and on two medium-wave transmissions (10 kW. and 5 kW.). Studios, programme and administrative offices are at Broadcasting House in central Kuching. The transmitting station is about 1½ miles, and the receiving station 4½ miles, away. High quality medium wave coverage is given within a radius of 60 miles of Kuching and short-wave reception is clear throughout Borneo and in other neighbouring countries in South-East Asia. About 35,000 licences are in current issue.

Principal Occupations

The majority of the population are engaged in agricultural pursuits; the indigenous tribes are almost all padi farmers but also frequently cultivate small rubber or sago plantations and collect jungle produce such as rattan, jelutong and damar (resin). The Chinese agriculturists rely on rubber and pepper. Malays and Melanaus are largely employed in sago and timber, whilst Ibans, when not busy on their padi farms, are employed as log extractors in the forest, on road work or as unskilled labour in the oilfields. Numbers employed in the principal industries are:

| Industry                  | Numbers |
|---------------------------|---------|
| Sawmills                  | 5,952   |
| Oilfields                 | n.a.    |
| Rubber Estates (excluding smallholders) | 967     |
| Cutch                     | 52      |
| Jelutong                  | 32      |
| Road and Building Construction | 993     |
| Mining and quarrying      | 112     |
| Bauxite mining            | 279     |
| Gold mining               | 92      |

Six trade unions were registered in 1958, bringing the total to 38.

Main Crops and Products

The main agricultural export products are rubber, pepper and sago. Rice, coconuts, tapioca, maize, coffee, fruit and vegetables are grown for local consumption. Local rice production is inadequate to meet local needs and there are considerable imports of rice, and wheat flour in the form of bread and noodles is used to supplement rice requirements.

Livestock are not plentiful and animal husbandry still plays only a small part in the rural economy. Pigs are kept by the Chinese and Dayaks and this aspect is developing.

Both marine and freshwater fisheries are of considerable importance, but production is inadequate to meet local needs, although the culture of fresh-water fish is increasing, and there are considerable imports of salted and tinned fish.

The Colony's mineral products are oil, gold, coal, antimony, mercury, diamonds, limestone, clay used for bricks and tiles, building stone and phosphate. Oil and gold have received the closest examination but, in common with the other minerals, a large amount of work remains to be carried out before their potentials are known.

There are many small factories processing rural products scattered throughout the more accessible parts of the country—particularly rice mills and...
rubber smokehouses; sago factories are mainly confined to the sago-growing areas, and there are a number of mills for production of coconut oil to meet the internal trade.

(a) Crude oil is piped to the refinery in Sarawak from the adjoining territory of Brunei, and constitutes most of the output. Crude oil from wells in Sarawak (56,890 tons in 1958 and 65,906 tons in 1957) is also treated at the same refinery and both crude and refined petroleums are included in the total exports.

In 1958 37·3% of domestic exports went to Singapore; 6·0% to the United Kingdom; 17·0% to other Commonwealth countries and 39·7% to other countries. In the same year 69·6% of imports originated in Brunei (crude oil for refining and subsequent re-export); 8·1% in the United Kingdom; 8·2% in other Commonwealth countries; and 14·1% in other countries.

The chief imports, other than oil from Brunei, are foodstuffs, textiles, tobacco, beverages, and manufactured goods.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are no marketing boards or statutory marketing organizations. Government provides facilities for the purchase of padi at a fixed floor price at a number of points scattered throughout the country. Control over the standard grading of sago and pepper for export is also exercised by Government.

Co-operative development was started in 1949 and has made steady progress. By 20th August, 1959, there were 170 co-operative societies on the Register engaged in the following business:

- Marketing (Vegetables and Fish) 3;
- Padi Savings 52;
- Padi Milling 22;
- Consumers Stores 21;
- Credit and Savings 66;
- Miscellaneous 4;
- Secondary (including Bank) 2.

These societies are distributed through all Divisions except the Fifth and are composed of Malays, Melanaus, Land Dayaks, Sea Dayaks, Kenyahs, Kayans and Chinese.
