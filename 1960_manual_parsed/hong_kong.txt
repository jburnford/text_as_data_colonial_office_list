HONG KONG

Area

The area of land is approximately 391 square miles (Hong Kong Island 32 square miles, Kowloon 3½ square miles, Stonecutters Island ½ square mile, New Territories (leased) 355 square miles). It includes all islands within a rectangular area of some 738 square miles, containing the leased and ceded territory. British waters are bounded on the north by the shores of Deep Bay and Mirs Bay, between which lies the land frontier with China.

Population

The population of the Colony in December 1958 was estimated to be 2,806,000, of whom the overwhelming majority are of Chinese race, many being British subjects by virtue of birth in the Colony. The number of Europeans and Americans permanently resident, excluding Service personnel and their families, is about 22,900, including some 13,000 British subjects from the United Kingdom and Commonwealth, 1,630 Portuguese, excluding those of British nationality, and approximately 6,270 other aliens.

Principal Towns

The overwhelming majority of the population lives on Hong Kong Island or in Kowloon, each of which is estimated to contain about 1,000,000 people. The capital is Victoria, on Hong Kong Island.

The principal centres of population in the New Territories are Tsuen Wan (80,000), which has recently grown into an important industrial centre with large textile, enamel and rubber factories, iron works, etc.; Cheung Chau (32,000), a small but densely populated island, important as a market and fishing centre; Yuen Long (20,000), a mainland market town; Tai O (14,600), a fishing and market centre on Lantao Island; Tai Po (13,000) and Shek Wu Hui (4,800), both mainland market towns; and Peng Chau (4,500), an island fishing port, with some industries.

Geographical Features

The Colony consists of the island of Hong Kong and a portion of the mainland to the North, together with 198 adjacent islands ranging from Lantao with an area of about 58 square miles, to uninhabited rocky islets. A peninsula, on which Kowloon stands, juts southward from the mainland towards Victoria on Hong Kong island. Between these two lies the harbour, one of the finest natural ports in the world. Much of the built-up area surrounding the harbour has been reclaimed or levelled.

The greater part of the Colony consists of steep, unproductive hillside, in some parts covered with dense scrub, in others seriously eroded as a result of indiscriminate felling of trees during the Japanese war-time occupation. Cultivation is confined mainly to the narrow valleys. The coastline is sharply indented.

A steep range of hills divides Kowloon from the New Territories to the North, in the centre of which is the highest mountain—Tai Mo Shan, 3,140 feet; Lantao Peak is 3,061 feet and Victoria Peak on Hong Kong Island 1,805 feet high.

Climate

The climate is sub-tropical and governed by monsoons, the winter being cool and dry, the summer hot and humid. The mean monthly temperature varies from 59° F. in February to 82° F. in July. The actual temperature rarely rises above 95° F. or falls below 40° F. The average annual rainfall is 84-76 inches, three-quarters of which falls between May and September. The mean relative humidity exceeds 80% during the summer but in early winter sometimes falls as low as 20%.

History

Hong Kong was founded as a British Colony in 1841, the cession of the Island to Great Britain being confirmed by the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. The area on which the main urban part of Kowloon now stands, together with Stonecutters Island in the harbour, Ap Lei Chau and Green Island, was ceded by the Convention of Peking in 1860; and in 1898 the New Territories, which consist of the rural area north of Kowloon and the islands around Hong Kong, were leased to Great Britain for 99 years.

The Colony was occupied by the Japanese from 1941 to 1945, and in the following four years made a remarkably rapid recovery.

Constitution

The Government is administered under Letters Patent of 14th February, 1917, by a Governor assisted by an Executive Council and a Legislative Council. The Executive Council, which is consulted by the Governor on all important administrative matters, consists of six officials and six unofficials, three of whom are Chinese and one a member of the Colony's Portuguese community. The Legislative Council consists of nine officials and eight unofficials, five of whom are Chinese and one Indian. There is an Urban Council with power to make by-laws relating to public health, sanitation and other subjects. It consists of six officials and 16 unofficials, eight of whom are elected.

Taxation

(1) Earnings and Profits Tax.—This tax, introduced for the first time in 1947 by the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112), is a substitute for the more orthodox type of income tax. Instead of one comprehensive tax there are four separate taxes, as follows:

(a) Profits Tax (subdivided into Corporation Profits Tax and Business Profits Tax).
(b) Salaries Tax.
(c) Interest Tax.
(d) Property Tax.

The standard rate for 1959-60 is 12½% and this rate is applied in full in the case of Profits Tax and Interest Tax (subject to an exemption limit under Business Profits Tax where tax is normally only charged if the profits exceed $7,000). Salaries Tax is levied on net income from employment after deducting a personal allowance of $7,000, and allowances for a wife ($7,000) and for up to nine children. The rates of tax charged vary from one-fifth of the standard rate on the first $3,000 of chargeable income to double the standard rate on chargeable income exceeding $45,000. There is a provision, however, whereby the maximum charge for Salaries Tax shall not exceed tax at the standard rate on the total assessable income without the deduction of any allowances. Property Tax is charged at one-half of the standard rate (i.e. 6¼%) on the net rateable value of all land and buildings situated in the Colony, other than in the New Territories.
Under all four taxes the charge is limited to profits or income arising in or derived from the Colony. As an alternative to these separate taxes, a resident of the Colony may elect to be personally assessed on his total Hong Kong income. A single assessment is then made by allowing similar allowances and charging similar rates of tax, as is the case under Salaries Tax. A set-off is then allowed for any amounts already paid under the four separate taxes.

(2) Estate Duty.—Estate Duty is levied on conventional lines at rates varying between 2% in the case of estates valued between $50,000 and $100,000, and 40% in the case of estates valued at over $15 million.

(3) Other Sources of Revenue.—Other sources of revenue are Rates, Stamp Duties, Entertainments Tax, Betting Tax and Business Registration Fees. Excise Duties are also payable on tobacco, hydrocarbon oils, liquor, and table waters.

Currency

The value of the HK$, at approximately HK $1=1s. 3d., is kept stable in relation to the £ sterling by an Exchange Equalization Fund.

The currency in circulation consists of $500, $100, $10 and $5 notes issued by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and to a small extent by two other Banks, and of $1 notes and nickel alloy 50 cent, 10 cent and 5 cent coins.

Development Plans

Over the next five or six years it is proposed to expend about $925 million on development projects, $187 million of which will be provided from the Colony’s Development Funds and Local Loans (mainly on housing), and the balance from general revenues.

The main items to be financed from revenue are as follows:

| Item                        | $   |
|------------------------------|-----|
| New Schools                  | 55  |

Education

In 1959 education was provided in 1,457 schools for over 435,000 pupils. This figure represents approximately one in six of the estimated total population. School enrolment may be divided as follows:

- Primary: 313,700
- Secondary: 68,800
- Post-secondary: 10,400
- Other types of Education: 42,900

Private schools provided places for some 254,000 children; grant-aided and subsidized schools for 125,000; while 72 Government institutions catered for 56,700. In 1958 there were about 1,400 students in the United Kingdom for higher studies, including those doing technical and vocational courses, while a number pursued their studies elsewhere. Government expenditure on education in the Colony was approximately $87 million as compared with $2½ million in 1938 and $1 million in 1928.

The University of Hong Kong has 1,021 students in the following faculties—arts, science, medicine, engineering and architecture. The annual Government grant to the University, totalled 8·5 million for 1958–59.

Libraries

Local libraries include an English and Chinese library at the University, a British Council library and a small educational library at the Education Department. Various clubs have well-stocked libraries for the use of their members.

Medical and Health

The Health division of the Medical Department undertakes the control of anti-epidemic measures, the care of expectant and parturient mothers, infant welfare work and the inspection and treatment of school children. It is also responsible for port and airport health work, anti-malarial measures, social hygiene, tuberculosis control and a B.C.G. campaign, food and drug control, public health propaganda, and pathological, chemical and biochemical laboratory work.

The Government maintains and operates twelve general and special hospitals and provides financial assistance to ten other hospitals run by voluntary organizations. In addition, there are in the Colony nine private hospitals which do not receive financial help from the Government. The numbers of beds in the three groups (as on 31st March, 1958) are 2,198, 3,593 and 1,106 respectively.

In-patients treated in Government and Government-aided hospitals during 1958 totalled over 128,000, and out-patients in the three main Government hospitals were just over 835,600.
There are also a large number of dispensaries and clinics in both urban and rural areas.

The general state of health is very good; there was no recurrence in epidemic form of influenza during 1958, but a total of 33,700 notifications was recorded.

The most serious scourge is tuberculosis; 13,485 cases were notified in 1958 with 17·1% fatalities. Pneumonia (all forms) occasioned over 4,400 deaths; infant mortality was 54·3 per 1,000 live births.

Government expenditure on these services during the year 1958-59 amounted to approximately $54 million, compared with $44·6 million in the previous year.

Capital expenditure on medical projects under the Public Works Non-Recurrent head accounted for another $5·7 million.

Communications

Air.—Hong Kong (Kai Tak) Airport has been limited in size in the past by the geographical features of the neighbourhood, but a new runway built on an artificial promontory and opened in September, 1958, has increased and improved the landing area. The most comprehensive airport lighting system in the Far East has been installed, enabling night operations to be carried out as from August 1959. Traffic continues to increase steadily, and eighteen companies operate regular international flights through the Colony. Principal aircraft types are Comet, Britannia, Viscount, Electra, DC-4, DC-6, DC-6B, and Constellation. During 1958, 9,858 international flights by commercial aircraft carried 262,204 passengers, 3,602 tons of freight and 971 tons of mail, in addition to transit traffic.

Rail.—There is a railway 36 kilometres long connecting Kowloon with the Chinese frontier, but there has been no through passenger traffic since October, 1949. Through goods traffic is conveyed in Chinese section wagons. Total goods carried during 1958 amounted to 238,114 tons, and 5,308,695 passengers were carried.

Roads.—There are 490 miles of roadway, 94·6% of which is of metalled construction.

Shipping.—50,061 vessels entered and cleared during 1958-59, their net registered tonnage being 33,912,475; 1,127,882 passengers landed or embarked by sea during the same period. Frequent ferry services cross the harbour and link the principal islands to the westward.

Sound and Television Broadcasting

Radio Hong Kong is the Government-owned broadcasting service. It transmits programmes on medium wave (2 kW.) from two separate stations, in English and four Chinese dialects. In addition Radio Hong Kong operates a short-wave station of 2½ kW. There were 71,631 licence holders at the end of 1958. Rediffusion (Hong Kong), Limited, operate a wired broadcasting service on a commercial basis with programmes in English and Chinese. At the same time, this organization is required to relay a certain proportion of programmes from Radio Hong Kong. At the end of 1958 there were some 52,696 subscribers to the service. Rediffusion Limited also operate a wired television service. A commercial broadcasting organization, the Hong Kong Commercial Broadcasting Co., Ltd., commenced operations in August, 1959 transmitting programmes on medium wave (1 kW) from two stations, in English and two Chinese dialects.

Principal Occupations

Before the war, most of the urban population was engaged in commerce, but since 1948 there has been a significant growth of local industries. In June, 1959, there were 192,843 workers in 4,894 registered and recorded factories and workshops; 81,223 of them were women. Another 100,000 people are estimated to be employed in smaller cottage-type industries and as outworkers. Reliable statistics of unemployment and under-employment are not obtainable; employment is liable to fluctuation during any year. Few rural families live entirely off the land, farmers' budgets being supplemented by remittances from family members overseas or working in urban jobs in Hong Kong and Kowloon. There is a large fishing population, most of which lives permanently afloat.

Figures for the main occupations are:

| Occupation                  | Number |

### Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

There are twenty Vegetable Marketing Cooperative Societies with a membership of more than 6,300. Eighteen of these Societies have formed a Federation of Vegetable Marketing Co-operative Societies. In addition, two Irrigation Societies, two Salaried Workers' Thrift and Loan Societies, two Consumers' and Credit Societies, one Fish Pond Society, 115 Housing Societies and 37 Pig Raising Societies have been formed. The last named have also federated and formed a Federation of Pig Raising Societies. Fishermen are becoming more aware of the benefits of co-operation and there are 28 Fishermen's Thrift and Loan Societies, seven Fishermen's Thrift Societies, one Fishermen's Credit and Marketing Society and one Fishermen's Thrift, Loan and Housing Society. A group of nine Fishermen's Co-operative Societies have formed themselves into a Federation. The total number of members of these Societies is more than 11,900.

The Vegetable Marketing Organization transports vegetables to the Central Wholesale Market in Kowloon from co-operative societies, collecting centres and depots in the New Territories. The collecting centres which are run by the farmers have, with the exception of two centres, now developed into co-operative societies.

Five Fish Wholesale Markets are operated by the Fish Marketing Organization. A revolving loan fund with a present ceiling of $800,000 has existed since 1946 and is of great benefit to fisherfolk; over $5,578,000 has been loaned from it. The Organization also operates schools for fishermen's children, and provides education for more than 2,600 students.
