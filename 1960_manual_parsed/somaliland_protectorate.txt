SOMALILAND PROTECTORATE

Area
The Protectorate extends along part of the southern shore of the Gulf of Aden and is 68,000 square miles in area.

Population
No complete census has yet been possible but the mainly nomadic Somali population is estimated to be 650,000. The non-indigenous element of the population is small. It consists of European and Indian officials of the Government, oil company personnel, one or two European representatives of commercial houses in Aden and a few Indian and Arab traders.

Principal Towns
The capital is Hargeisa—population about 45,000; Burao has about 10,000, Berbera, the principal port, about 7,500. The population of these towns varies considerably at different times of the year.

Geographical Features
The country is divided naturally into two main regions: the coastal lowlands and the highlands. These two regions are further subdivided: the coastal lowlands, or Guban, into flat maritime plains and steep foothills with broad valleys; and the highlands into the main watershed range of mountains, rising to over 7,000 feet, and the plateau or Ogo consisting of the southern and eastern plains. The whole of the plateau area is above 2,000 feet and constitutes the principal pastures of the country.

Climate
Except for the intense heat of the coast, with an irritating dust-laden wind which also occurs in a few inland areas during the south-west monsoon from May to September, the climate is healthy and pleasant.

The temperature varies from 70°-108°F in the coastal areas, and in the highlands from occasional slight local frosts (32°F) to between 80°F and 99°F. The rainfall varies from an average of 2 inches at Berbera on the coast, 5 inches at Burao and 15 inches at Hargeisa, to as much as 50 inches in the higher mountains of Erigavo and Borama Districts.

History
The first British treaty with a Somali tribe was signed in 1827 after a British ship had been attacked off Berbera, its cargo plundered and a number of its crew murdered. In 1840 various further treaties were concluded with the Sultan of Tadjura and the Governor of Zeilah with the object of affording unrestricted harbouring facilities for ships of the East India Company.

In 1875 the Khedive of Egypt claimed jurisdiction over the entire Somali coast as far as Cape Guardafui, but in 1884, during the Mahdi revolt in the Sudan, Egyptian garrisons were withdrawn. The British then occupied Zeilah, Berbera and Bulhar and sent officials from Aden to administer these ports, and a British Protectorate was established over the tribes on the Somaliland coast from Zeilah to Berbera. By 1887 a series of treaties guaranteeing British protection had been concluded with various Somali tribes and in the following year the limits of the British and French spheres of influence were defined. The other inland boundaries of the Protectorate were defined by agreements with Italy in 1894 and Ethiopia in 1897.

Until 1898 the Somaliland Protectorate was administered by the Resident at Aden as a dependency of the Government of India. In that year it was transferred to the Foreign Office and in 1905 to the Colonial Office.

From 1901 until 1920 the Government was engaged in sporadic operations against the Mullah, Mohamed Abdulla Hassan. In 1910 the Government withdrew to the coast for three years but it was not until 1920 that the Mullah’s power was finally broken.

In August 1940 Italian Forces from Ethiopia invaded and occupied the Protectorate but in March 1941 the British Forces drove out the Italians and a Military Government was established. The Protectorate remained under military administration until 1948 when the Civil Government was reconstituted.

In 1955, certain areas contiguous to the western and southern frontiers of the Protectorate, which had been administered by a British Military Administration under an agreement with the Imperial Ethiopian Government made in 1942 and which constitute essential grazing grounds for Protectorate tribesmen, were returned to Ethiopian administration. The Protectorate Government, however, retained the right to maintain a liaison organization in these areas under a fifteen-year agreement concluded between Her Majesty’s Government and the Imperial Ethiopian Government in December, 1954.

Constitution
Executive and Legislative Councils were established by the Somaliland (Constitution) Order in Council, 1955, and first met in May 1957. The Executive Council consists of three ex officio and four official members. The Somaliland (Constitution) Order in Council, 1959, enabled the membership of the Legislative Council to be enlarged to consist of the Governor as President, three ex officio members, not more than fourteen official members, thirteen elected members, and not more than three nominated members. In the Protectorate’s first elections in March 1959 twelve members were elected (no candidate standing in one constituency). Four of the elected members are associated with the work of groups of Departments and attend Executive Council from time to time.

On 9th February 1959 the Secretary of State for the Colonies announced in the Legislative Council that an unofficial majority would be introduced in both the Executive and Legislative Councils in 1960, and that thereafter such further constitutional steps as necessary would lead to early self-government. Furthermore, recognising the desire expressed by many Somalis in the Protectorate for a closer association with Somalia, if, after Somalia became independent, both territories wished to explore the possibility, Her Majesty’s Government would arrange for negotiations to take place.

A Commission on Representational Reform was subsequently appointed and as a result arrangements are now being made, to take effect early in 1960 (Somaliland (Constitution) (No. 2) Order in Council, 1959), for a Legislative Council consisting of a Speaker, three ex officio members, and thirty-three elected members. The machinery of Government has been reorganized to prepare for the introduction at the same time of a ministerial
system, comprising seven Ministries, and it is intended to establish an Executive Council with three ex officio and four unofficial members.

The Protectorate Advisory Council, which was established in 1947, held its last meeting in its present form in September 1959. It is being replaced by a Council consisting of traditional tribal authorities and will continue to operate in an advisory capacity.

Local Government Councils, with executive powers, are established in five centres: Hargeisa, Berbera, Burao, Borama and Gebilch.

Land Policy

Government recognizes, or grants, individual title to land only in the towns. Apart from a small number of old freehold and waqf* titles, land in the towns is held on lease from the Government. Private ownership of farmland is developing but hitherto no official system for the alienation of land has been recognised.

Taxation

The principal form of taxation is indirect, i.e. Customs import and export duties. There is no income tax, but a form of business profits tax was introduced in 1955. The only other form of direct taxation is a house tax payable by owners or occupiers of property, which is assessed at 10% of the annual rental value of the property. In addition, a municipal sales tax or octroi, exists on certain commodities, e.g. livestock and cereals brought for sale into specific townships.

Public Finance

A divided budget system was introduced in the financial year 1956-57 under which approximately half the expenditure heads in the estimates are financed entirely from local revenue; these are known as the Unaided Services. The remaining heads are known as the Aided Services and continue to be dependent on a grant-in-aid from the United Kingdom. The Unaided Services are within the financial competence of the Legislative Council, subject to certain safeguards.

In 1958-59 some £925,876 of the local revenue was derived from Customs and Excise duties. In the same year the main heads of expenditure were:

| Aided Services | £       |
|----------------|---------|
| Public Works   | 434,662 |
| Police and Prisons | 233,939 |
| External Relations | 84,068 |

| Unaided Services | £       |
|------------------|---------|
| Education        | 116,221 |
| Health           | 143,481 |
| District Administration and Local Government | 161,123 |
| Posts and Telegraphs | 50,765 |

Currency

The currency in circulation is the East African currency issued by the East African Currency Board in London. The rupee currency of India, which was legal tender until 31st October, 1951, was withdrawn in that year. The East African currency is interchangeable with sterling at par.

Development Plans

The expenditure of some £722,000 on development schemes financed from the allocation of £917,232 made to the Protectorate under the 1940

| Revenue | Expenditure |
|---------|-------------|
| C.D. and W. Grants | U.K. Deficit Grant-in-Aid | Total |
| £       | £           | £       |
| 1939    | 3,098       | 168,585  | 21,000  | 189,585 | 262,481 |
| 1954†   | 98,385      | 712,066  | 404,000 | 1,214,451 | 1,197,003 |

† Includes revenue and expenditure of £10,649 in 1954 and £80,680 in 1956 in respect of Army Works.

‡ Includes expenditure of £59,795 in respect of Army Works Services.
and 1945 Colonial Development and Welfare Acts was distributed as follows:

| Service          | Amount   |
|------------------|----------|
| Basic Services   | £300,785 |
| Social Services  | £210,491 |
| Productive Services | £210,844 |

The development plans drawn up under the 1955 Colonial Development and Welfare Act in respect of the four years 1956–60 provide for a target expenditure of £2,474,434 distributed as follows:

| Service          | Amount   |
|------------------|----------|
| Basic Services   | £615,722 |
| Social Services  | £894,785 |
| Productive Services | £946,952 |
| Unallocated      | £16,975  |

Colonial Development and Welfare allocations made to the Protectorate under the 1955 Act at present amount to £2,000,000, to which figure has been added the unexpended part amounting to approximately £160,000 remaining from the allocation provided under the 1940 and 1945 Colonial Development and Welfare Acts.

The above figures do not include grants made for research and centrally administered schemes on which expenditure under the 1940 and 1945 Acts amounted to £2,414 and £90,271 respectively; grants approved under the 1955 Act amount to £6,093 and £100,165 respectively.

As the territory is substantially grant-aided, it cannot at present provide additional finance by raising loans, or from its own resources. It is intended, however, that an increasing amount of recurrent expenditure will be borne from local resources, and in the current development period it is expected that this will amount to some £144,000.

Other Development

One American and one British Oil Company are prospecting for oil in the Protectorate.

Education

On 1st November 1958 there were 130 grant-aided private Koranic Schools (3,050 pupils); 36 Government and local authority Elementary Schools (1,898 pupils); and 13 Intermediate Schools (914 pupils). There is a Teacher Training Centre with 22 trainee teachers and a Trades School for boys (71 pupils), which provides training in Rural Science and clerical work. The one Secondary School had 81 pupils.

One hundred and twenty students are undergoing courses in the United Kingdom and elsewhere on Government Scholarships. There are also small Government schools for European and Indian children (69 pupils in 1958), but there are no mission or other Voluntary Agency schools in the Protectorate.

Expenditure on education in 1935–36 was £500, while in 1958–59 it amounted to £116,221.

Libraries, etc.

The first public library was opened in Hargeisa in 1958. It was built and is being run by the Hargeisa Local Government Council. A public library is also maintained by the British Council in Hargeisa. Reading rooms in which wireless sets are installed for public listening are maintained in the main towns and settlements.

Health

The commoner diseases are the respiratory diseases, particularly lobar pneumonia, tropical ulcer, venereal diseases, tuberculosis, eye complaints—mainly conjunctivitis with increasing incidence of trachoma—diarrhoea and dysentery and malaria. Malaria is seasonal and its incidence from year to year varies with rainfall: it sometimes assumes epidemic proportions particularly in the “Haud” grazing areas in Ethiopia, south of the Protectorate, but its incidence is generally low and no administrative headquarters can be classified as malarious. A Malaria Survey of the Protectorate is being carried out with the assistance of the World Health Organization and the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund. At the same time the U.N.I.C.E.F. assisted control measures are being continued in the southern part of the Protectorate. When the full survey is complete it is hoped to evolve better methods of control. General measures for prevention of disease are largely directed to raising the standard of housing and environmental sanitation in the towns, and to educating the people in the avoidance of disease. Following a tuberculosis sensitivity survey carried out by the W.H.O. in 1956 a tuberculosis control scheme financed by Colonial Development and Welfare funds, was started in 1958, tuberculosis wards have been built at all hospitals, the staff has been augmented, and a tuberculin testing survey and B.C.G. inoculation campaign is in operation.

There are six district hospitals, with 936 beds. These include 65 beds in the Mental Hospital at Berbera and 338 beds reserved for the treatment of tuberculosis, 175 of these being in the Tuberculosis Hospital at Hargeisa, and 20 in a tuberculosis hostel attached to a dispensary. There are 15 dispensaries in the Protectorate, manned by locally-trained dressers, and a number of Tribal Aids live and work among the nomads.

During 1958 115,977 persons were treated at hospitals out-patient departments; of these 9,343 were admitted. There were 46,197 first attendances at dispensaries.

Expenditure on medical and health services in 1935–36 was £11,000. The expenditure for 1958–59 was £153,538 from the Protectorate Budget and £88,712 from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds.

Communications

Regular air services are maintained by Aden Airways between Hargeisa, Berbera and Aden, and with East Africa. There are no internal services or railways.

There are approximately 3,000 miles of roads, mainly of gravel or earth.

A fairly regular weekly steamer service operates between Aden and Berbera. Other sea communications are maintained by dhow. The Brocklebank Line maintains a monthly service from the United Kingdom to Berbera during the months October to April.

Broadcasting

The Government broadcasting station, Radio Somali, broadcasts from Hargeisa in Somali and English from 1330 to 1730 G.M.T. (4.30 to 8.30 p.m. local time) daily on 4797 k/cs (63 metres) and 9667 k/cs (31 metres). There is no form of licensing of wireless receivers. It is estimated that there are between 2,000 and 2,500 private receivers in the country.

Principal Occupations

Government service, public works and the Desert Locust Control Organization of the East
Africa High Commission provide the main source of local employment but a fair amount of seasonal labour is employed on farming as there are some 14,000 small farms in the country. Livestock and animal products industries provide employment for drovers, flayers, etc. There are also several hundred paid labourers on charcoal and lime production.

**Main Crops and Products**

The main animal products are: sheep on the hoof (for the Arabian markets, particularly Aden), sheep and goat skins (for the American and European markets) and cattle on the hoof for the Near East. A rough estimate of the livestock population owned by British Protected Persons is:—camels between 2,000,000 and 4,000,000; sheep probably not less than 6,000,000 and 2,000,000 goats. There are also about 250,000 cattle and some horses.

Some sorghum and maize is grown for local consumption, the total acreage being about 130,000 acres. Frankincense and myrrh are interesting local products.
