SEYCHELLES

Area
The Colony lies in the Indian Ocean 970 miles east of Zanzibar. Its area is 156½ square miles.

Mahé is the largest of the Seychelles Islands. It is 17 miles long and 3 to 7 miles broad, and is estimated to cover 55½ square miles.

The other chief islands are Praslin (9,700 acres); Silhouette (4,900 acres); La Digue (2,500 acres); Curieuse, Felicité, North Island, St. Anne, Providence, Frigate, Denis, Cerf and Bird or Sea Cow Island. The Amirantes, Alphonse Island, Bijoutier Island, St. Francois Island, St. Pierre Island, the Cosmoledo Group, Astove Island, Assumption Island, Coëtivy, Aldabra and Farquhar Island are also dependencies of Seychelles.

Population
The estimate at 30th June, 1959, was 43,149.

Principal Town
Port Victoria, the capital, is on the island of Mahé. It is the only town of consequence and has a population of over 10,000.

Geographical Features
The Colony's 92 islands are divided into two groups of entirely different geological formation (1) granitic islands (2) coral islands. The former, about a third of the total number, are predominantly mountainous. In some of them and particularly in Mahé, the principal island, a narrow coastal belt of level land surrounds the granitic mountain massif; and from this the land slopes steeply up the mountain side to an elevation at Morne Seychellois, the highest peak, of 3,000 feet. The coral islands are flat, elevated coral reefs at different stages of formation.

Over fourteen square miles are under forest and woodland.

Climate
In spite of proximity to the equator the climate is healthy. The shade temperature seldom exceeds 85° and during the coolest months drops to 75°. At higher levels the temperature is slightly lower and the air fresher. The hot months are from December to May. From June to November, during the south-east monsoon, the temperature is slightly lower and the atmosphere less humid. The rainfall varies in different parts of Mahé from 70–135 inches; the greater part falls in the hot months during the north-west monsoon, and then the climate is humid and somewhat enervating. The average annual rainfall in Victoria for the past 57 years is 91·13 inches and the mean temperature was 82°. Malaria is unknown. The islands are outside the hurricane zone and thunderstorms are rare.

History
The Seychelles Islands were uninhabited until 1768 when the French commenced serious occupation, having explored them in 1742 and 1744, and set up their "Stone of Possession" on Mahe in 1756. The first capitulation to an English naval force took place on 17th May, 1794, when the Colony surrendered to Captain Newcome of H.M.S. Orpheus. The capitulation was only transitory in effect and when the English squadron had sailed M. de Quincy, the French Commandant of the Colony, continued his administration in the name of the Republic. Between that date and the final surrender in 1810, there were no less than six separate capitulations. The Treaty of Paris in 1814 finally ratified the status of the archipelago as a British possession together with the Ile de France. Seychelles and Mauritius, as the two now became, continued to be administered as a single Colony and, even more remarkably, de Quincy continued in office as Civil Agent, Commandant and Judge until his death in 1827, having served the French for twenty and the British for eighteen years. A series of Civil Agents and Civil Commissioners under the tutelage of Mauritius administered the Seychelles from 1811 to 1888, but some degree of separation was effected in 1872, when a Board of Civil Commissioners was appointed with financial autonomy. The powers of this Board under a Chief Civil Commissioner were extended by another Order in Council of 1874. In 1888 the importance of the islands warranted a further change in the constitution, and an Order in Council was passed creating an Administrator with a nominated Executive and Legislative Council as from 1889. In 1897 the separation from Mauritius became more marked, when the Administrator was endowed with the full powers of Governor. Six years later, by Letters Patent of 31st August, 1903, this separation was completed and Seychelles became a Crown Colony with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils.
Constitution

The elective principle was introduced into the Colony for the first time in 1948. The Legislative Council consists of the Governor, as President, six official members, four elected and two nominated unofficial members. The Executive Council consists of the Governor as President, four official members and such other persons, one at least of whom must be an unofficial member, as the Governor may from time to time appoint.

Land Policy

All land, other than Crown land, is held in freehold. Individual ownership is recognized but aliens may purchase land only with the approval of Government.

Taxation

The principal form of direct taxation is income tax. Residents are eligible for the following personal allowances:

- Earned income .. 1/10 (max. Rs. 1,500)
- Personal (single) .. Rs. 500
- Personal (married) .. Rs. 2,000
- Child .. Rs. 500 (max. 2,500).

Rates of tax chargeable after deduction of allowances are:

- 2½% on first Rs. 3,000 taxable income.
- 5% on next Rs. 3,000 then increasing by 2½% for each Rs. 1,000 of taxable income up to Rs. 15,000.
- Rs. 15,000–Rs. 25,000, 30%.
- Rs. 25,000–Rs. 40,000, 40%.
- All taxable income over Rs. 40,000, 50%.

Companies pay a flat rate of 30%.

A land tax of 40 cents per acre is also charged.

The principal sources of indirect taxation are Customs duties at varying rates. Licensing exists for most trades and professions. There is also a succession duty at a graduated scale.

Currency

The currency in circulation consists of notes of denominations of Rs. 50, Rs. 10, Rs. 5, 1 rupee and 50 cents. Notes of 1 rupee and 50 cents are however being gradually withdrawn from circulation. Coinage comprises silver pieces of 1 rupee, ½ rupee, ¼ rupee and 10 cents and cupro-nickel pieces of 5 cents, 2 cents and 1 cent. The rupee is sterling backed and worth 1s. 6d.

Development Plans

The Development Plan, 1956–61, was recast to rely primarily on Colonial Development and Welfare funds to increase the rate of development. From April 1956 to 31st March 1959 some £462,800 has been spent from Colonial Development and Welfare Funds. Development expenditure from April 1959 to March 1960 in the first year of the quinquennium 1959–1964, is likely to be of the order of £300,000. A development plan for the next four years is in course of preparation. Expenditure on schemes still uncompleted on 1st January 1959, together with those approved since that date, is planned to fall under the following main headings:

| Category                  | £       |
|---------------------------|---------|
| Agriculture and Forestry  | 75,740  |
| Education                 | 25,280  |

| Social Services           | 58,750  |

Education

There are 38 primary schools, 5 secondary schools, a trade training centre, a centre for continuation classes and in-service teacher training, and a teacher training college.

In October 1958 there were 2,754 boys and 2,761 girls in primary schools, and 257 boys and 296 girls in secondary schools. There is no higher education in the Colony apart from teacher training. Twenty-six students are undergoing further education or vocational training in the United Kingdom.

Government expenditure on education in 1958 was Rs. 587,869 (exclusive of Colonial Development and Welfare grants) and that of religious missions Rs. 172,907.

Libraries

Victoria is served by a library established by the Carnegie Trust, and there are small libraries run by the Co-operation Book Society, the Roman Catholic Mission and the Alliance Francaise.

Health

Although within the tropics, Seychelles has very few diseases usually associated with tropical climates. Malaria, yellow fever and relapsing fever are absent and filariasis is infrequent. The incidence of leprosy is diminishing. That of intestinal infestation and amoebiasis continues high. A programme for improving sanitation in Victoria has been started. Tuberculosis is being dealt with by B.C.G. inoculation, starting with the schools.

The Public Heath Service is organized under the Medical Officer of Health and consists of nine Health Inspectors and six Health Visitors. Seven Health Inspectors are stationed in Mahé, and two
in Praslin. The Health Visitors, with one exception, are stationed in Mahé. There is one Health Visitor in Praslin.

There are infant welfare, antenatal and V.D. clinics at several centres on Mahé and Praslin and also on La Digue. An immunization centre at Victoria deals with yellow fever, diphtheria, T.A.B. and other inoculations. Dental facilities are available daily in Victoria, weekly at Anse Royale and fortnightly at Beolère.

A School Health Service was established in 1957, and covers all the schools in the Colony. School follow-up clinics are also arranged by the Public Health Nurses for the instruction of parents. Immunization of infants against diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus was started in 1957 in all the infant welfare clinics.

Communications

There are at present no landing grounds for aircraft.

There are 86 miles of motorable all-weather roads in Mahé, with a width of 15-20 feet. Tarmac surfacing is in progress in Victoria and suburbs, 17 miles having been completed. A further 13 miles should be completed during 1959.

A bi-weekly service of Government motor launches carrying some 55 persons is in operation between Victoria, Mahé, and the islands of Praslin and La Digue. Passenger ships of the British India Line and of the Eastern Shipping Corporation combine at present to operate a service giving a call twice a month both eastwards and westwards in the case of the former line, and once a month both eastwards and westwards in the case of the latter line. The British India ships run from Durban to Bombay, and the Eastern Shipping Corporation operates from Dar es Salaam and Mombasa to Bombay.

Occasional passenger-carrying cargo boats run directly from London (Brocklebank Line) or from Singapore (Royal Interocean Line).

Broadcasting

The Seychelles Broadcasting (transmitting and wired broadcasting) Station at Victoria Road, Mahé, broadcasts nightly for one hour on a wavelength of 60·2 metres, 4,990 kc/s. with an output of 40 W. The management is carried out voluntarily by the Director of Education, and Messrs. Cable and Wireless provide the technical services and maintenance.

No receiving licences are issued.

Principal Occupations

The majority of the population is engaged in agriculture and fishing. It is estimated that some 22,000 are so employed. Approximate numbers employed in other occupations in 1958 were:

- Domestic service: 3,000
- Artisans: 2,500
- Public administration: 750
- Trade and commerce: 500

There are five registered Trade Unions—

(1) The Stevedores and Lighterage Workers' Union.
(2) The Seychelles Building Trades Union.
(3) The General Workers' Union.
(4) The Seychelles Teachers' Union.
(5) The Seychelles Cable and Wireless Limited Staff Union.

Main Crops and Products

The main agricultural products for export are copra, cinnamon leaf oil, cinnamon bark, patchouli leaves and vanilla pods. Breadfruit, bananas, cassava, sweet potatoes and a number of other fruits, root crops and green vegetables are grown for local consumption.

No figures are available of the livestock population.

Inshore fisheries' estimated production is 1,000-1,500 tons per annum. Catches are largely consumed locally but there is a small export of dried salted fish, including shark.

Sea birds' eggs and green turtles contribute to local food supplies and dried green turtle products and tortoiseshell (from hawksbill turtles) are exported.

Low-nitrogen sea bird guano and phosphatic rock are worked on several outlying coral islands, some thousands of tons being exported annually according to market demand.

Local processing includes high grade copra production in numerous locally-made kilns; essential oil distillation (chiefly of cinnamon leaves) in under-fired and steam heated stills numbering over 50; low extraction, animal powered, and high extraction, motor powered copra expelling for oil and stock feed; small scale soap manufacture and one small coir factory. Cinnamon quill production has also commenced.
