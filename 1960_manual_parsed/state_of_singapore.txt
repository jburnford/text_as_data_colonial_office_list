STATE OF SINGAPORE

Area
The area of Singapore, including inland waters and adjacent islets, is 224·5 square miles. The City of Singapore covers an area of 31·5 square miles.

Population
The total population at the 1957 census was 1,445,929:

|          | '000 |
|----------|------|
| Chinese  | 1,090·6 |
| Malaysians| 197·1 |
| Indians and Pakistanis | 124·1 |
| Europeans | 10·8 |
| Eurasians | 11·4 |
| Others   | 12·0 |

The population of Singapore City was 912,343. In June 1958 the total population was estimated at 1,514,900, City at 953,500.

Geographical Features
The island of Singapore is connected with the mainland of the Malay peninsula by a causeway three-quarters of a mile long, carrying a road, railway and water mains.

The highest point on Singapore Island is Bukit Timah, 581 feet above sea level. The largest permanent stream is the Sungei Seletar which is nine miles long. Headwaters from this and two other streams have been impounded to form reservoirs.

Climate of Singapore
There are no well marked dry and wet seasons. Rain falls throughout the year, temperature is uniform, humidity high. The mean maximum temperature is 87°, the mean minimum 75°; average annual rainfall is 95 inches.

History
A prosperous commercial centre flourished at Singapore under the name of Singapura (the "Lion City") in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries; this was destroyed by the Javanese in 1377. In 1819, Sir Stamford Raffles signed an agreement with the Sultan of Johore Lingga which gave the British the right to establish a factory, and under which the Sultan agreed that no land was to be alienated to, or treaty concluded with any other foreign power. The Island's population, 150 when Raffles landed in January 1819, had risen by August to 5,000 and the Settlement developed rapidly into a trading centre. By the Treaty of London, 1824, Holland withdrew its former objections to the occupation of Singapore and ceded Malacca, while Britain surrendered Bencoolen and all the East India Company's possessions in Sumatra. In the same year a treaty was signed with the Sultan by which he ceded to the East India Company the island of Singapore in full sovereignty and property. By this time Raffles had endowed the island with a magistracy, a code of laws and police force, trading regulations, a town-planning scheme, and an English school (the Raffles Institution). From 1824 the phenomenal progress of Singapore continued. The value of trade in 1864 was £13,252,175. The population had risen by 1860 to 81,734 of all nationalities, but with a significant majority (over 50,000) of Chinese. Singapore had completely overshadowed its sister Settlements of Malacca and Penang, with which it had been incorporated in 1826 as the Straits Settlements, and it was natural that the seat of Government should be transferred from Penang to Singapore in 1832.

The Straits Settlements was brought under the Presidency of Bengal in 1830 and transferred to the direct control of the Governor-General in 1851. With the abolition of the Company's monopoly of the China trade in 1834 India lost interest in the Straits: it was difficult to find suitable officials for the territory and protection in war was impossible. The Viceroy, Lord Canning, had no objection to the transfer of the Settlements to the Colonial Office, which in 1860 was agreed to in principle. In 1866 an Act was passed to transfer the control of the Settlements from the Indian Government to the Colonial Office. This was formally put into effect in 1867 when the Straits Settlements became a Crown Colony.

Though the adjacent islands of Blakang Mati and Pulau Brani had been fortified, the garrison in 1914 consisted only of the equivalent of two battalions, while from the naval point of view Singapore was no more than a port of call and coaling station. With the emergence of Japan as the third naval power in the world the British Government decided in 1921 that Singapore should become the headquarters of a battle fleet and by 1938 a first-class naval base had been constructed with graving and floating docks to accommodate the largest capital ships. The defences of the island were, however, designed for resistance to attack by sea and in February 1942 it fell to a Japanese land attack down the Malay Peninsula and across the Johore Strait. For three and a half years it was occupied by the Japanese, but was liberated on the 5th September, 1945, without opposition, by forces under the command of Lord Louis (now Earl) Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander South-East Asia, and upon the restoration of civilian government, it was detached from the other Settlements of Penang and Malacca and placed under a separate administration.

Government
The first elections were held in April 1948 and only six of the 22 Legislative Council members were elected. In 1951 the number of elected members was increased by three.

The next milestone in Singapore's constitutional development was an Order in Council which came into force on 8th February 1955, and which gave Singapore a large measure of internal self-government. The form of Government was a Council of Ministers collectively responsible to a Legislative Assembly whose membership was increased to 32 members, 25 of whom were elected from single-member constituencies. The other seven members consisted of three official members and four nominated unofficials. The Governor ceased to preside over the Assembly and was replaced by a Speaker whom he appointed.

The Council of Ministers consisted of the Governor as President, three ex officio members and seven Ministers appointed from among the elected and nominated members of the Assembly.

Singapore achieved statehood in 1959 after 140 years of British rule. An agreement signed in London on 11th April 1957 provided for the constitution of a State of Singapore with full internal self-government, and the creation of a Singapore citizenship. There would be as the Queen's representative a Malayan-born Yang di-Pertuan Negara, or Head of State, a Cabinet presided over by the Prime Minister and a fully-
elected Legislative Assembly of 51 members presided over by a Speaker and Deputy Speaker of their own selection.

The new constitution under the Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council 1958, came into being on 3rd June 1959, by a proclamation of the Governor, Sir William Goode, who thereupon became concurrently Singapore's first Yang di-Pertuan Negara and the United Kingdom Commissioner. These two Offices were, however, after the first six months of the constitution, separated and held by different individuals. The Head of State must now be Malayan-born. The United Kingdom Commissioner remains responsible for external defence and external affairs but a responsibility in certain fields of external affairs is delegated to the Government of the State of Singapore.

The Singapore Government is responsible for internal security, subject, however, to the oversight of an Internal Security Council consisting of three representatives each of the United Kingdom and Singapore Governments and one of the Government of the Federation of Malaya.

The Council of Ministers has been replaced by a Cabinet of nine elected Ministers presided over by the Prime Minister. The Ministers are collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly for policy but have full executive authority over their respective ministries, each of which has a Parliamentary Secretary (an elected Assemblyman), and a Permanent Secretary (a Civil Servant) who exercises supervision under the general direction of the Minister. There is a Deputy Prime Minister. The portfolios of the other Ministers are:—National Development, Health, Finance, Labour and Law, Culture, Home Affairs and Education.

**Land Policy**

Alienation is now invariably by leases for periods up to 99 years. Statutory grants and grants in fee simple are issued only in special circumstances affecting old titles. The supply of vacant Crown land within the City area is practically exhausted and large areas have had to be acquired for public purposes, such as roads, school sites, and housing.

**Taxation**

Income tax is levied on income accruing in or derived from the State or received in the State from outside. Companies are chargeable at 40% and resident individuals at a sliding scale ranging from 5% on the first $1,500 of chargeable income to 50% on incomes exceeding $50,000. Non-resident individuals are charged at 40%, but British subjects and British protected persons may be entitled to a proportion of the personal allowances and reduced rates applicable to resident individuals. Double taxation arrangements with the United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark and Norway are in force.

Personal allowances are $3,000 for an unmarried person and $5,000 for a married couple, with a sliding scale of allowances for children from $750 for the first child to $200 for the sixth and subsequent children up to a maximum allowance of $8,150 for the family. In cases where children are maintained and educated outside Malaya, the allowances for children may be increased up to double the amounts. Deductions are also allowed in respect of life assurance premia and contributions to approved pension or provident funds.

The Public Debt of the State at the 31st December 1958 amounted to $115 million or approximately $74·24 per head of the population:

- (a) S.S. 3½ Loan, 1962-72: $30 million
- (b) S.S. 3½ War Loan, 1952-59: $25 million
- (c) S.S. 3½ War Loan, 1953-60: $10 million
- (d) Singapore 3½ Rehabilitation Loan, 1962-70: $50 million

of which (a) is repayable by the Singapore and Penang Harbour Boards.

**Currency**

The currency in circulation is that issued by the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo, and is the only legal tender in the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo and Brunei. It consists of the following:

(i) Currency Notes issued by
   (a) The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya;
   (b) The Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo.

(ii) Nickel coin of 5 cent denomination.

(iii) Cupro-nickel coin of various denominations below $1.

(iv) Copper coin of 1 cent denomination and below.

(v) Bronze coin of 1 cent denomination and below.

(i) above consists of notes of the denominations of $10,000, $1,000, $100, $50, $10, $5, $1 and subsidiary notes of 50 cents, 20 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents and 1 cent. Currency notes bearing dates prior to 1st July 1941 were demonetized on 31st August 1948.

Silver coins were demonetized on 31st December, 1952, and ceased to be legal tender from that date. The amount of such coins nominally in circulation as at 31st December, 1958, was $21,844,260·45.

The currency is linked to sterling and is fixed at 2s. 4d. to the dollar. The total amount of currency notes in circulation on 31st December, 1958, was $948,530,912·02 and coins (other than silver) $45,203,410·33.
Development Plans

The Government party's platform during the elections laid emphasis on reorganizing the economy of Singapore from a purely non-productive economy to a productive one, and for this purpose establishing new industries and expanding the existing manufacturing industries.

To carry out this plan, it is proposed to establish a statutory Economic Development Board with a capital of $100,000,000 for the development of industry and the co-ordination of the technical training programme with industrial expansion. This will supersede the Singapore Industrial Promotion Board. The Economic Development Board will have as its policy not only the initiation of industrial enterprises either by itself or with private concerns but it will also place at the disposal of the industry short-term and long-term funds, and the services and expert knowledge of its technical personnel will be available to all industrial enterprises.

It is hoped that by this means a solution will be provided to the main economic problem facing Singapore today, which is to provide increasing opportunities for employment. Singapore's population of 1·5 million is increasing at the rate of 4 per cent per annum, and in four or five years' time the additional young people looking for work each year may be between 20,000 and 30,000.

In keeping with the plans for expansion of industry are the plans for further expansion of the supply of power and water. The large modern power station at Pasir Panjang, which has cost $93,000,000, is now in full operation. The new St. James Power Station, estimated to cost $19,000,000, will be in full operation by December 1960. The supply of water is more than keeping pace with the rapidly-increasing population. The Tebrau River Scheme, costing $20,000,000 and producing 25 million gallons of treated water per day, is in full operation. The Johore River Project, estimated to cost about $25,000,000, is scheduled to start in 1960 and expected to be completed by 1964. Sewerage works extensions costing $42,300,000 are under construction.

On the agricultural front, the $1,000,000 animal husbandry station at Sembawang is now completed. The Station covers about 40 acres and will demonstrate to the farmers modern techniques of animal farming and will also disseminate information to them. Increased research into the breeding and nutrition of livestock for new genetic strains suitable to the climatic environment of Singapore should produce poultry which are better egg layers and pigs which mature earlier.

The development of the Singapore Airport, the Singapore Harbour Board and the Singapore Telephone Board is proceeding, to meet Singapore's expanding needs. The Singapore Harbour Board has plans for the development of the East Lagoon to provide nine new deep-water berths, the construction of a breakwater and the reclamation of 52 acres of land from the sea. The project is estimated to cost $11,000,000.

Education

The education system of the State of Singapore provides education for some 324,690 pupils in 729 regular schools. The University of Malaya in Singapore has 1,096 men and 376 women students, of whom 933 are from outside Singapore. The University also runs part-time courses in Singapore for 47 men and 7 women students, of whom one is from outside Singapore. The Kuala Lumpur Division of the University, which was opened in the Federation of Malaya in 1957, continues to expand. The Teachers' Training College provides courses for 1,148 men and 1,115 women students, 2,016 of these being on part-time courses while working as Teachers-in-Training in Primary Schools. There are 603 students in Technical Schools. In addition there are 14,889 students enrolled in Adult and Evening Classes maintained and aided by Government. Of the pupils in regular schools, 165,205 are taught in English, 142,177 in Chinese, and 17,307 in the vernacular languages (Malay and Tamil). There are 10,430 teachers employed, 50% of them being trained. Of the school pupils, approximately 15·3% are in secondary classes. The Education Finance Board scrutinizes and approves the Department Estimates before their submission to Government.

The net cost of education in 1958 was $81·4 million. The comparative figures for 1948 of $4·725 million indicate the vast increase in cost due to the implementation of the State's Development Programme in education.

The Nanyang University, which was registered as a limited liability company in 1954, was incorporated by the Nanyang University Ordinance, published on 16th March 1959. At the end of 1958, 1,305 students attended its three colleges of Arts, Science and Commerce. A Nanyang University Commission was set up by agreement with the Ministry of Education and convened in February 1959. The Commission's Report, published on 12th March 1959, has been referred to a Joint Committee consisting of representatives of the University and nominees of the Minister for Education.

The Singapore Polytechnic had at the end of 1958 2,700 students attending classes in five Departments : General Education ; Science and Technology ; Engineering ; Building and Architecture ; and Commerce. Over 400 were full-time students, 500 were students released by their employers to attend one full day and two evenings per week and the remainder were evening students. A course in Nautical Training is also available at the Singapore Polytechnic.

Libraries, Museums, etc.

The Raffles National Library contains about 150,000 volumes, including a large and important collection of books on Malaya. There are four part-time branches. Books for children are provided at each library, and there is a separate children's library at the Central Library. The library functions as a free public library and is financed by the Government. It serves as the depository for the State's archives and for the books and other publications which are printed in Singapore and received under the terms of the Printers and Publishers Ordinance.

Books in Chinese, Malay and Tamil, which languages are currently spoken in Singapore, are now available, as well as books in English and music scores. Mobile libraries serving the outlying parts of the city area, rural parts of the Island and schools, are in operation.

The Raffles Museum contains collections covering the zoology, ethnography and archaeology of the Malaysian region, and of the history of Singapore and Malaya. It publishes the Bulletin of the Raffles Museum (devoted to papers on zoology), the Memoirs of the Raffles Museum
(devoted to papers on local history and anthropology) and a series of popular pamphlets on museum subjects.

The Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, closely associated with the Raffles Museum, publishes a quarterly journal devoted mainly to papers on history, archaeology and ethnography.

Health

The Ministry of Health controls nine hospitals containing 7,100 beds. The hospitals specialise in acute medical and surgical cases (1,750 beds), infectious diseases (250 beds), maternal and gynaecological cases (445 beds), tuberculosis (1,150 beds), mental disease cases (2,220 beds), leprosy cases (1,020 beds) and venereal disease cases (65 beds). Including those under the control of the local authorities, there are 23 static dispensaries, nine travelling dispensaries and two floating dispensaries. In addition, there are 63 main and subsidiary Maternal and Child Health centres. There is an island-wide School Health Service based at the new Institute of Health with four static clinics. The hospital system is now being decentralized and one district hospital was opened in 1959. A chronic sick hospital has also been started in 1959. A new Five-year Plan has been formulated which will provide 15 polyclinics for out-patient care, a number of dental units attached to schools, and ten Maternal and Child Health centres. There is an efficient air and sea quarantine service. A new maternity hospital is planned and a new gynaecology wing will be brought into use early in 1960.

Based on the findings of a full tuberculosis survey carried out in 1958 under the Colombo Plan and a continuing B.C.G. campaign started under U.N.I.C.E.F. auspices in 1951, an extensive Tuberculosis Control programme is under way. B.C.G. vaccination is now available on an island-wide basis. A Tuberculosis Control Unit has been established. The Royal Singapore Chest Clinic is preparing to build a hospital. The Ministry of Labour and Law continues to operate its Tuberculosis Treatment Allowance Scheme in conjunction with the Almoners' Service for patients whose prognosis is good.

The main hospitals out-patient attendances have risen in the last ten years to 3.7 million and attendances at Maternal and Child Health clinics have risen to nearly 500,000. The Local Health Authorities Domiciliary Services attended to 6,587 confinements, and 30,588 births took place in the first eleven months of 1959 in the Maternity Hospital. Admissions for acute medical and surgical conditions are 44,520 and for maternity and gynaecological conditions 43,415.

A modern out-patient treatment centre for leprosy patients has been started as a result of the policy not to segregate all patients suffering from this disease and to isolate only those in the infectious state.

There is a Medical Faculty in the University of Malaya where the qualification of M.B., B.S. registrable in the United Kingdom can be obtained after a full course of training lasting six years. Training is also given for the B.D.S. (Bachelor of Dental Surgery) also registrable in the United Kingdom. A course for the degree of B.Ph. (Bachelor of Pharmacy) is being instituted. A nine-month course for the Diploma of the Royal Society of Health for Public Health Inspectors and a one-year course for the Health Visitor's Certificate of this Society is conducted at the Institute of Health. The University awards a Diploma in Public Health which is recognised by the General Medical Council.

The School of Nursing provides general nurse training; associated schools provide for the training of nurses in specialized fields as tuberculosis nurses, psychiatric nurses, paediatric nurses, district nurses and public health nurses. The Assistant Nurse Training School and the Midwifery School provide training for Assistant Nurses and Midwives.

The training of public health inspectors is carried out at the Institute of Health and is one of the oldest courses of training in Singapore—having been started in 1921.

Statutory Boards control the qualification and registration of medical practitioners, dentists, pharmacists, nurses and midwives.

Health figures for the State continue to be satisfactory. There is a crude death rate of 7.02 per 1,000 compared with 9.51 in 1939 and 8.63 in 1955. The infant mortality rate is 43.4 per 1,000 live births compared with 130.4 in 1939 and 49.69 in 1955.

A minor outbreak of smallpox with nine local cases occurred in a localized area in 1959 as a result of a primary case in a passenger who had recently come from India. With the discovery of these cases a mass vaccination campaign was carried out during April and May when approximately 1.2 million persons were vaccinated. Apart from this, Singapore remains one of the healthiest countries in South-East Asia.

The birth rate of 41.9 per thousand, representing approximately 65,000 births, is one of the highest in the world. Over half the population in Singapore is under the age of 19 years.

All the specialized departments such as Ear, Nose and Throat, Orthopaedics and Paediatrics are included in the hospital services. All kinds of ancillary medical personnel continue to be employed on an expanding scale. Treatment of mental diseases is based upon one of the largest institutions in the East and here all the modern forms of treatment are given.

The gross expenditure of public funds on medical and health services in 1958 amounted to $42.1 millions compared with $29.9 millions in 1955.

Communications

Air—Singapore Airport, seven and a half miles from the city centre, is an international airport and one of the finest in South-East Asia. It has a runway of 8,000 feet (L.C.N. 60) which can be extended to 10,000 ft. if required; a wide taxi-way and efficient lighting. The Joint Air Traffic Control Centre based at Singapore Airport controls all flights within the confines of its 750,000 square miles Flight Information Region.

In 1958 a total of 13,132 aircraft and 253,796 passengers used the airport.

Major external international passenger, air mail and cargo air carriers operating through Singapore are:

- Qantas Empire Airways.
- British Overseas Airways Corporation.
- K.L.M. Royal Dutch Airlines.
- Pan American World Airways.
- Cathay Pacific Airways.
Thai Airways.
Garuda Indonesian Airways.
Air Ceylon.
Air India International.
Union of Burma Airways.
Japan Air Lines.
Skyways Limited.
Hunting Clan Limited.

Malayan Airways Limited operate daily domestic flights to all important points in the Federation of Malaya and Borneo, and regular scheduled services to Indonesia, Thailand, Borneo, Sarawak, and Hong Kong.

Road—The Public Works Department maintains 285-76 miles of bituminous roads in the City and Rural areas. The City Council maintains 209-2 miles of roads in the City area.

Rail—The Malayan Railway system is owned by the Government of the Federation of Malaya, and serves Singapore also. The track is of metre gauge and the total route mileage is 1,028 miles. The Railway enters the State at the Johore Causeway and continues for a distance of 16 miles to the terminal station near Keppel Harbour. There are four railway stations in the Island of Singapore.

Water—The control of the port of Singapore is divided between (a) a government and (b) a non-government authority.

(a) The Master Attendant administers all the waters of the port including the Outer and Inner Roads, Keppel Harbour, the Western Anchorages, Telok Ayer Basin, the Singapore, Rochore, Kallang and Geylang rivers, etc.

(b) The Singapore Harbour Board administers the wharves, docks and premises of the Board situated in Keppel Harbour and a slipway at Tanjong Rhu, under the provisions of the Ports Ordinance; also the quays and waterfront premises at Telok Ayer Basin, on behalf of the Singapore Government. The Chairman and members of the Board are appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.

The natural harbours around the southern end of the island still retain their deep water channel capable of taking the largest ships. Wharves comprise:

| Length | Water depth |
|--------|-------------|
| West Wharf | 4,525 ft. 33 ft. and over |
| Empire Dock (24½ acres) | 3,522 ft. 27 ft. and over |
| Main Wharf | 3,152 ft. 33 ft. and over |
| East Wharf | 700 ft. 24 ft. |
| North Wall, Empire Dock | 940 ft. 12 ft. |

During the year ended 30th June, 1958, cargo handled by the wharves totalled 5,452,794 tons. The number of vessels accommodated alongside the wharves during this period was 3,575, net registered tonnage being 11,776,408.

The Board maintains a fleet of tugs for the towing, berthing and unberthing of ships, including a salvage tug with a range of 3,000 miles; also a Fire Brigade.

The Board has first-class facilities for dry docking and repairing ships of all sizes. There are six dry docks, the largest of these being the King's Dock, which can accommodate ships up to 45,000 tons gross. Repair berths total 3,000 feet in length.

The port is served by passenger and cargo lines from Europe, North and South America, South and East Africa, Australia, New Zealand and the various countries in Asia. Several coasting lines are engaged in conveying transit cargo to and from Thailand, Indonesia, Borneo, Sarawak, Malayan ports and Cambodia.

Broadcasting

Radio Singapore is operated by the Department of Broadcasting for the State of Singapore. Three simultaneous transmissions carry daily programmes in Chinese (seven dialects), English, Malay and Tamil. The total number of hours of broadcasting is 267 per week, of which over 20 hours are occupied by broadcasts to schools in Chinese, English, Malay and Tamil.

The Department has studios and offices at Caldecott Hill. The main transmitting station is at Jurong, some 14½ miles from the City, where three medium wave transmitters are situated.

Radio Singapore also supplies short wave coverage to listeners in the Federation of Malaya by three transmitters which operate from the Jurong station. Federation of Malaya's programme is conveyed by V.H.F. link from Kuala Lumpur via Caldecott Hill.

The number of broadcast listening station licences in Singapore at 31st July 1959 was 86,183.

A commercial company which operates a wired broadcasting service in Singapore under Government licence, had 41,002 subscribers in Singapore at 31st July 1959.

Principal Occupations

The estimated numbers of employees in the chief industries are: transport and communications (including port and lightercage) 74,500, commerce and finance 100,000, light industries 90,000, agriculture (largely market gardening) 28,000, public administration (central defence services and local authorities) 57,500. There are 219 registered trade unions of employees, having a membership of 130,114.

Main Products

The small area of agricultural land is used mainly to produce food crops for local consumption. Poultry-rearing as a rural industry is thriving and 18,000,000 head are kept. This is more than sufficient for local consumption and allows some to be exported. The number of pigs in Singapore is 750,000.

Manufactures comprise a wide range of light industries. The traditional concentration on processing of primary products such as rubber, tin, sago, rattan, and the provision of shipbuilding, docking and ship repairing facilities, light engineering works and motor assembly plants has been supplemented in recent years by a growing range of consumer goods such as dry cell batteries, glass products, edible oils, soap, perfumes, paper products, poultry food, paint, metal boxes, shoe polish, rope, biscuits, confectionery, and pencils. Five factories now manufacture cigarettes from imported cut tobacco.

The huge long-term building programmes are also materially assisting construction industries such as brick and tile making, cement block manufacturing, sawmilling, metal window-frame works and makers of furniture and fixtures.
A steel-rolling mill produces mild steel bars similar to British products.

The first and most modern cement bulking and packing plant in South-East Asia commenced operation in Singapore at the end of 1958. Costing $2,000,000, it has a storage capacity of 10,000 tons.

At the end of 1959, the new Economic Development Board will begin to function, replacing the Singapore Industrial Promotion Board. With an initial capital fund of $100,000,000, the new Board will broadly be both a financing institution and an industrial corporation. As a financing institution, the Board will grant loans and advance to industrial concerns or subscribe to their debentures and shares. It will also underwrite the issue of stocks and guarantee on agreed terms and conditions loans raised by industrial concerns in the public market.

As an industrial corporation, the Board will establish, invest and manage its own industrial concerns or enter into partnership or any other arrangement for joint working with private industrial firms.

There is extensive fishing in local waters, but the catch is insufficient to meet the demand and is supplemented by imports, mainly from the Federation of Malaya. In consequence, Government is giving every encouragement to the development of offshore fisheries.

Trade

Singapore handles the major proportion of the imports and exports of the Federation of Malaya. In addition much of the external trade of her immediate neighbours passes through her hands. The chief exports are rubber, tin, timber, petroleum products, copra, canned pineapples, coconut oil and spices. A wide range of manufactured consumer and capital goods is also imported for local consumption and for re-export.

Marketing and Co-operative Organizations

Singapore participates on a pan-Malayan basis with the Government of the Federation of Malaya in legislation concerning the marketing of rubber and pineapples. The Malayan Rubber Export Registration Board is concerned with regulating the packing, grading and shipping of rubber and with measures for ensuring that the quality of rubber to be exported is of the standard required. A Pan-Malayan Statutory Board, the Malayan Pineapple Industry Board, has been appointed to replace the Pineapple Joint Industrial Council. The Board is vested with overall authority in the conduct of the affairs of the industry including the negotiation of agreements on prices and grades of fruits, the regulation of production, and the marketing of canned pineapples.

Singapore has 102 Co-operative Societies, made up of 40 Thrift and Loan Societies, 18 Thrift and Investment Societies, 12 Stores and Shops Societies, 11 Marketing Societies, 2 Housing Societies, 4 Rural Credit Societies, 5 Labourers' and Co-operative Credit Societies, 4 Banking and Union Societies and 6 Miscellaneous Societies. Total membership is 34,584, working capital $13,154,431 and Reserve Fund $351,893.
