THE GAMBIA.

Situation and Area.

The Gambia is a great river of Western Africa, falling into the Atlantic Ocean by a large estuary measuring in some parts nearly 27 miles across, but contracting to 10 miles between Bird Island and Cape St. Mary, and to little more than two between Barra Point and the town of Bathurst on St. Mary's Island. There are 26 feet of water over the bar of the river at low water. The town of Bathurst, 13° 24' N. lat., 16° 36' W. long., is situated on St. Mary's Island, a sandbank about three and a half miles long and a mile and a quarter broad, separated from the mainland by a narrow channel called Oyster Creek. A large portion of the island is a swamp, the level of which is in many parts below that of the river.

The Colony on the river Gambia consists of the Island of St. Mary, British Komombo, Albreda, the Ceded Mile, and McCarthy's Island, situated between the Falls of Barraconda and Bathurst, and 153 miles distant from the latter. This island forms the line of demarcation between those portions of the river known as the upper and lower river. The total area of the Colony proper is about 69 square miles (equal to Jersey and Guernsey). The Protectorate extends on both banks of the river for 250 miles from its mouth. But by an ordinance No. 7 of 1902 all parts of the Colony, except the Island of St. Mary, have been placed under the Protectorate system of administration. The Island of St. Mary has an area of about 2,500 acres, the greater part of which is swampy, and a population of 8,807. The territory administered as Protectorate is 3,911 sq. miles, and has an estimated population of 152,000.

History.

The Gambia was discovered by the early Portuguese navigators, but they made no settlement.

In 1588 a patent was granted by Queen Elizabeth to some merchants in Exeter to trade with the Gambia, and in 1618 a Company was formed for this. It was not successful, and another established two years later also failed. In 1664 a fort was built on the island, now known as Fort James.

In 1724, and subsequently till its abolition, the trade in slaves formed the staple traffic of the Company. The general commerce between Great Britain and the Gambia fell off after the abolition of the slave trade (1807) till 1816, when a new settlement was formed at the Island of St. Mary by British merchants from Senegal and the town of Bathurst commenced.

The right of trade was abandoned to England by France in the treaty of 1783, with the exception of a French factory, which was subsequently established at Albreda on the north bank of the river. The same treaty gave the Senegal river to the French, with the exception of an exclusive right to trade with the Arabs at Portendic for gum, which was retained by England. These two exceptional rights were exchanged in 1867.

From 1807 the settlement was subject to the Government of Sierra Leone, and was annexed to it by Act of Parliament in 1821, till in 1843 it was created an independent colony, with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils for the administration of its affairs. By the charter of 19th February, 1866, it became a portion of the Government of the West Africa Settlements, and continued to be so under the charter of the 19th December, 1874, until it was made a separate Government in 1888.

McCarthy's Island was purchased in 1823; the Ceded Mile was granted by the King of Barra in 1826 and 1832; St. Mary's Island was ceded in 1827; and British Komombo was granted by the King of Komombo in various cessions in 1840, 1850, and 1855.

The Protectorate has been established at various times from 1894 to 1901 by agreement with the different Chiefs concerned.

In 1900 disaffection arose among certain towns of the Protectorate which were under the influence of Fodi Kabba, a chief who had been expelled from British territory in 1892, and had since established his headquarters at Medina in French territory. Two travelling commissioners, Mr. Sitwell and Mr. Silva, were murdered at Sankandi, in June, 1900. It became necessary to send a punitive expedition to the Gambia, and Col. H. E. Brake was selected to command. Sankandi was taken, and, with the co-operation of the French, Medina was also taken, and Fodi Kabba was killed on the 23rd of March, 1901.

Industry.

The principal productions of the settlement and of the adjoining districts are ground nuts, hides, beeswax, rice, cotton, maize, corn, palm kernels, indiarubber, wax, and native "pagns" or country cloths. With the exception of the weaving of cotton into native cloths, the manufacture of vegetable oils, boat building, and some brick-making, there are no manufacturing industries in the country.

A considerable entrepôt trade is done with the French settlements and the adjoining coast districts in cotton goods, spirits, tobacco, rice, kola nuts, and hardware.

In 1905 the principal imports and exports were as follows:

| Articles       | Quantity     | Value   |
|----------------|--------------|---------|
| Cotton goods   | 2,779 pgs.   | £53,211 |
| Tobacco        | 317,965 lbs. | 6,381   |
| Kola nuts      | 818,384 ,,   | 30,248  |
| Spirits        | 19,405 gals. | 3,562   |
| Wines          | 15,340 ,,    | 1,999   |
| Sugar          | 4,009 cwts.  | 3,965   |
| Salt           | 1,337 tons   | 897     |
| Gunpowder      | 235 barrels  | 443     |
| Rice           | 52,883 cwts. | 23,239  |
| Specie         |              | 123,456 |

| Articles       | Quantity     | Value   |
|----------------|--------------|---------|
| Ground nuts    | 29,499 tons  | £169,426|
| Rubber         | 9,071 lbs.   | 915     |
| Palm kernels   | 4,540 cwts.  | 1,612   |
| Wax            | 35,828 lbs.  | 1,444   |
| Hides          | 11,723       | 2,637   |
| Specie         |              | 95,876  |

Most of the exports go to France, but half of the imports come from England. Bathurst is a port of registry, and had, on 31st December, 1905, 171 vessels of 3,013 tons in the aggregate. The ground nut is the staple product of the settlement. It is planted in June, and reaped in November, and largely exported to the South of Europe for the extraction of oil. In 1905 the export was 29,499 tons.
Relations with the Interior.

Since the delimitation of the boundary of the Protectorate by the Anglo-French Commissioners in 1891, steps have been taken to bring the inhabitants of the Protectorate gradually into closer relationship with the Government of the Colony. An Order in Council, issued on the 23rd of November, 1893, provided for the establishment of Her Majesty's jurisdiction within the Protectorate, and since then an Ordinance has been passed providing for the establishment of magistrates and also native courts.

Travelling Commissioners regularly, during the eight months of dry weather, travel through the Protectorate on both banks of the river for 287 miles, and in Komombo and Fogni. These parts of the Protectorate are gradually getting more under the immediate control of the Government. A "yard" or "hut" tax, which averages about 4s. per annum for a family, is imposed in the Protectorate.

Stipends are now only paid in a few cases, and presents are occasionally made to the more influential chiefs, in return for their services in preserving peace and keeping the trade routes open.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is that of the Latin Union; there is no Colonial coinage and no note issue. A Government savings bank was established in 1886, and had on 31st Dec., 1905, £8,151.4s., deposited by 430 persons. A Branch of the Bank of British West Africa was opened in January, 1902.

Education.

The schools, which are wholly in the hands of the several denominations, receive grants-in-aid. Of ordinary elementary schools in Bathurst, there is one Anglican school, two Wesleyan and two Roman Catholic, with about 1,001 scholars in all. Education is not compulsory, and fees are charged. In addition, the Wesleyan Society have established a Technical School, with 24 pupils, on undenominational lines, to which the Government contribute £300 a year; and there is also a Mohammedan School with 117 pupils, at which the ordinary rudiments of an English and Arabic education are taught, the teachers of it being paid by the Government. At McCarthy's Island there is one elementary Wesleyan school with 35 pupils.

Means of Communication.

The Liverpool mail steamers call every fortnight. Telegraph cables place Bathurst in communication with Europe and West Africa. There are no railways, internal telegraphs, or metalled roads, save one from Bathurst to Cape St. Mary, 7½ miles across the Oyster Creek Bridge, which connects the island of St. Mary with the mainland of British Komombo. Horses will live, and the river forms an unrivalled highway for 250 miles. The roads in the Protectorate are kept clear, and light traps or bicycles could pass along in those districts which are free from swamps. A Government steamer now runs weekly to and from McCarthy's Island, stopping at intermediate places, carrying 1st class passengers at 2½d. per mile and deck passengers at 1½d. per mile, letters at 1½d. each, and affording freight and towage according to a fixed tariff.

The postage of letters to the United Kingdom, India, and certain Colonies* is 1½d. per ½ oz. There is one internal post.

Climate and Inhabitants.

The climate is fairly healthy during the dry season. The mean temperature is 82°, the annual range being from 60° to 104°. The average rainfall is 50 inches. The rainfall for 1904 was 38·02 inches, the rainy season being from June to October, and the cool Harmattan from November to February.

The inhabitants are mostly of the negro race, the chief tribes being the Jollofs, Mandingoes, and Jolahs. There are 80 whites resident in the colony.

Defence.

The Colony and Protectorate is now garrisoned by a company of the West African Frontier Force, 120 strong, one-third of whom consist of men of the Bambara tribe.
