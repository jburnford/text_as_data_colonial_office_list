DOMINION OF CANADA.

THE DOMINION.

The Provinces of Ontario, Quebec (formerly constituting the Colony of Canada), New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, were, by the Imperial Act, 30-31 Vict., c. 3, formed into one Dominion. This Act was brought into force on July 1st, by Royal Proclamation, bearing date the 22nd May, 1867. Its essential provisions are given below.

The Governor-General of Canada was, by Letters Patent of 1st April, 1870, appointed Governor of Rupert's Land. The admission of Rupert's Land into the Dominion of Canada after the 15th July, 1870, was provided for by Order in Council of the 23rd June, 1870, and the Province of Manitoba was erected out of this Territory by a Canadian Act, 33 Vict., cap. 3, and made a Province of the Dominion 15th July, 1870.

By Order of Her Majesty in Council, dated 16th May, 1871, issued on the authority of the British North America Act, 1867, on Addresses from the Houses of Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of British Columbia, that Colony was incorporated in the Dominion, the union taking effect from the 20th of July, 1871.

Prince Edward Island was admitted by Order in Council, bearing date 26th of June, 1873, on the 1st of July in that year.

By an Act passed in 1876, the portion of the N.W. Territories lying to the north of Manitoba was created into a separate district, under the name of the District of Keewatin, but under the control of the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vict., cap. 49 (1875), the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North-Western Territory (with the exception of the portion forming the Province of Manitoba), were placed under the jurisdiction and control of a Lieutenant-Governor and Council, separate and distinct from Manitoba.

On the 31st of July, 1880, in compliance with the prayer of an address from the Parliament of Canada, dated the 3rd of May, 1878, Her Majesty issued an Order in Council annexing to the Dominion of Canada from the 1st of September, 1880, such British Possessions in North America (other than Newfoundland) as were not previously included in the Dominion.

By Minute of Council of May 17th, 1882, the districts of Assiniboia, Saskatchewan Alberta, and Athabasca, were created, and by Order in Council October 2nd, 1895, modified by Order in Council 18th December, 1897, the remaining territory was subdivided into the districts of Ungava, Franklin, Mackenzie, and Yukon, the last-named being made a separate territory, distinct from the North-West Territories, under special regulations by chapter 6 of the Acts of the Federal Parliament, 1898.

By chapters 3 and 27 of the Act of 1905 the four provisional districts of Alberta, Assiniboia, Saskatchewan and Athabasca were formed into the two provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and were admitted into the Dominion as such on the 1st September, 1905. The dividing line runs north and south. Alberta has an area of 253,540 square miles, and Saskatchewan of 250,650 square miles.

History.

Particulars as to the history of each province will be found in the following pages, but it may here conveniently be stated that the north-east coast of the Dominion seems to have been first discovered by the Norse seamen of the middle ages. Cabot reached Labrador in 1497, and the fisheries off this coast were frequented early in the sixteenth century. In 1535 Cartier settled on the St. Lawrence on behalf of France, and others followed. The whole territory became British by the Treaty of Paris, 1763.

Constitution.

The Executive Government is vested in the Crown, and is exercised by a Governor-General appointed by the King, assisted by a Privy Council chosen and summoned by himself. The Cabinet, as in England, is a Committee of the Privy Council, formed of the principal members of the Government. The seat of Government, until the King shall otherwise direct, is Ottawa, in Ontario.

The supreme legislative power is vested in a Parliament, consisting of the King, a Senate, and a House of Commons. The Senate consists of 87 members nominated for life by the Governor-General, and so chosen that 24 belong to Ontario, 24 to Quebec, and the remainder to the other provinces of the Dominion. The qualification for Senator is the possession of property worth $4,000, age of thirty years, and residence within the province for which he is appointed. The House of Commons consisted originally of 181 elected members, which number has been increased by additions on the accession of new provinces, and by the increase in population, and is now 214; 86 representing Ontario, 65 Quebec, 18 Nova Scotia, 13 New Brunswick, 10 Manitoba, 7 British Columbia, 4 Prince Edward Island, 4 Alberta, 6 Saskatchewan, and 1 the Yukon Territory. The basis on which the number of members allotted to each province is regulated, is that Quebec shall always have 65, and the other provinces a proportional number according to their population at each decennial census. There is no property qualification. Each member of the Senate receives $2,500 per annum, and each member of the Commons a maximum of $2,500 per session, with certain deductions for days of non-attendance. A Parliament lasts five years if not sooner dissolved. Election is by ballot, and the franchise is regulated by the several Provincial Legislatures,
which also regulate the polling divisions and the voters' lists. The session usually extends from February to May.

For each province there is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General, and holding office during pleasure, but not removable within five years of appointment, except for cause assigned. He receives a salary fixed and provided by the Dominion Parliament, and is assisted by an Executive Council usually composed of the chief provincial officials who possess the confidence of the Provincial Assembly.

Each province has a "Legislative Assembly," and in Quebec and Nova Scotia there is also a "Legislative Council," forming a second chamber. The Provincial Legislatures possess the power of altering their constitutions. There is a Legislative Assembly in Alberta and one in Saskatchewan, each consisting of 25 members. The territory not comprised within any province (such as the North-East Territory and the Arctic Islands) is very thinly inhabited, and is administered by the Minister of the Interior at Ottawa.

The Dominion Parliament has exclusive legislative power in all matters except those specifically delegated by the constitution to the Provincial Legislatures, and the Canadian Constitution is in this respect the reverse of that of the United States. Among such general matters may be named public finance, trade regulation, postal service, currency, coinage, banking and navigation matters, defence, the law relating to crimes, bankruptcy, copyright, patents, marriage and divorce, naturalisation, and native (Indian) affairs.

The powers of the Provincial Legislatures are confined to certain specified subjects, of which the chief are the alteration of their own constitutions, direct taxation within the province, and provincial loans, the management of provincial public lands, and of provincial and municipal offices, hospitals, gaols, &c., licences, local works, and the general civil law and procedure. With regard to education, they have full powers, subject only to certain provisions to secure protection to religious minorities. In agricultural, quarantine, and immigration matters, they possess concurrent legislative powers with the Dominion Parliament.

The Judges are appointed by the Governor-General in the superior, district, and county courts throughout the Dominion, except in the probate courts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.

The Dominion Government assumed the Provincial debts existing at the time of the Union, and agreed to pay to each Province an annual subsidy at the rate of 80 cents per head, according to each decennial census till the population in each province reached 400,000. Each Province also receives an annual allowance for Government, and for interest on the amount by which its debt at the Union fell short of the authorised amount.

In the new provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan the annual subsidy for each is (1) $375,000 till the population in each reaches 400,000; then (2) $62,500 till the population is 800,000; then (3) $750,000 till the population reaches 1,200,000; and thereafter $1,125,000. In lieu of public lands, which the Dominion retains, each province receives $93,750 a year for five years.

Bills passed by the Provincial Legislature require the assent of the Lieutenant-Governor, and may be disallowed within a year by the Governor-General. Those passed by the Dominion Parliament require the assent of the Governor-General, and may be disallowed within two years by the King.

Provision was made in the Act constituting the Dominion for the admission into it of any of the other British possessions on the continent of North America, and they have all been since admitted except Newfoundland.

Provision was also made for the construction of a railway from the River St. Lawrence to Halifax, and (in the Order in Council admitting British Columbia) for the construction of a railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. Both these have been constructed.

Provision was made for the construction of a line of railway from Moncton, N.B., to Winnipeg, and thence to the Pacific Ocean, under the name of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway. The first contracts for building were let in August, 1905.

Local Government.

In all the provinces local self-government has been developed to the fullest extent. In the complete form as adopted by Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia and other provinces, the whole municipal organisation comprises: (a) the townships, being rural districts of an area of 8 or 10 square miles; (b) villages with a population over 750; (c) towns with a population of over 2,000. Such of these as are comprised within a large district, called a county, constitute (d) the county municipality; (e) cities are established from the growth of towns when their population exceeds 15,000. The townships and villages are administered by a reeve and councilors; the towns by a mayor and councillors, and the cities by a mayor and aldermen. The governing body of the county municipality is composed of the members elected by districts containing one or more townships or villages, the presiding officer being styled "Warden." The Councils have powers to levy rates, create debts, promote agriculture, trade or manufactures, or railways, powers relating to drainage, roads, paupers, cemeteries, public schools, free libraries, markets, fire companies, preservation of the peace, &c.

Situation and Area.

The Dominion of Canada occupies the northern half of the American continent (except a portion of Labrador, Newfoundland, and Alaska, the latter belonging to the United States), stretching from latitude 49° to beyond the polar circle, and comprises an area computed at 3,745,574 square miles (30 times the area of the United Kingdom, or nearly four times that of British India). The seven older Provinces of the Dominion comprise a little over 1,000,000 square miles. The Dominion includes all the Arctic islands (but not Greenland, which is Danish), as well as Anticosti, Prince Edward Island, and Cape Breton on the east, and Vancouver and Queen Charlotte's Islands on the west.

About 1,650,000 of the people are of French extraction, over one million three hundred thousand of these residing in Quebec, where French is the usual language spoken.

The total population includes about 94,000 Indians, living chiefly in Manitoba, British Columbia, and the North-West Territories, and there are about 34,000 half breeds. They are under the supervision of Government agents, and have large districts reserved for them, where they live mainly by hunting, fishing, and traffic in furs. According to the census of 1901 there were 17,299 Chinese in Canada, most of whom are in British Columbia, and a few thousand Esquimaux along the northern coasts.

In 1901, $110,486,008 and $13,311,750. In 1902, $120,814,750 and $15,155,136. In 1903, $137,605,195, and $17,069,881. In 1904, $150,826,515, and $19,564,586. In 1905, $162,738,571, and $20,580,302.

The amount of customs duties paid in 1897 on British goods was $6,205,367, in 1898 it was $6,449,428,† in 1899 it was $7,328,192, in 1900 $8,074,541, in 1901, $7,485,406, in 1902, $8,424,693, in 1903, $9,841,627, in 1904, $10,838,017, and in 1905, $11,171,010.

**Manufacturing and Industry.**

Manufacturing is carried on somewhat extensively. The total capital employed in 1901 in factories having more than five hands was $441,053,060; the number of employes, 306,694; the wages paid $88,143,472 a year, and the annual product $452,775,577. The annual product of all mechanical industries, irrespective of number of hands employed, was $569,817,720, equal to $106.08 per head of the population.

**Industry.**

The main industry of the Dominion is agriculture, an enormous quantity of cereals and dairy produce being raised and exported. The fisheries of the maritime provinces are very extensive, and large quantities of dried, pickled, and canned fish and lobsters are exported. The lumber and fur trades are also important. Manufactures have been very considerably developed, the output being in the census year equal to $106.08 per head of the population. The output of wood pulp for the calendar year 1903 was valued at nearly five and a quarter million dollars. Coal and gold (in British Columbia, the Yukon Territory, and Nova Scotia) and copper are extensively worked. Valuable nickel (in Ontario) and phosphate mines exist. Shipbuilding is an important industry, and, besides ships, the principal among manufactured articles exported are furniture and other manufactures of wood, leather, agricultural and musical instruments. The principal imports are textile manufactures, coal, hardware, tea, sugar, raw cotton, hides, and tobacco.

The yield of Canadian fisheries since 1896 was as follows:

| Year | Value |
|------|-------|
| 1896 | $20,407,425 |
| 1897 | $22,783,546 |
| 1898 | $19,667,126 |
| 1899 | $21,891,706 |
| 1900 | $21,557,639 |
| 1901 | $25,737,154 |
| 1902 | $21,959,433 |
| 1903 | $23,101,878 |
| 1904 | $23,516,439 |
| 1905 | $29,479,502 |

The number of persons employed in connection with the fisheries is estimated at 90,000.

The arrivals and clearances were, in 1905, a total tonnage of 32,277,820, engaged in outside trade, and 44,377,261 tons engaged in coasting trade.

The number of steamers and sailing vessels on the Register Books of the Dominion on 31st December, 1905, was 7,325, with a net tonnage of 669,825. Of this number, 2,654 were steamers, with a gross tonnage of 382,888. The number of seamen employed was about 128,563.

In 1905 the number of light stations was 822; of lighthouses, 1,038; of fog whistles, 44; and of automatic fog horns, 34.

**Railways.**

The length of steam railways in operation in the Dominion on 30th June, 1905, was 20,487 miles. Canada ranks eighth in absolute mileage among the states and kingdoms of the world possessing railway systems. The total capital invested amounted to $1,248,668,414 on 30th June, 1905. The total quantity of goods carried in the year 1905 amounted to 50,893,957 tons. The number of passengers was 25,288,723, and the distance travelled by trains was 65,934,114 miles. The total receipts were $106,467,199, and working expenses $79,977,574.

The Dominion Government owns and maintains 1,658 miles of railways, which have been constructed at a cost of $84,193,801. The working expenses in 1905 were $8,879,291, and the receipts, $7,000,853.

There are 47 Electric Railways in Canada. These ran 45,959,101 car miles, and carried...
203,467,317 passengers, or nearly five passengers per mile run.

In November, 1885, the Canadian Pacific Railway, connecting the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean, was completed, and the road was opened for general traffic from Montreal to Vancouver on 28th June, 1886. The distance from Liverpool to Yokohama by this road, via Quebec, is 925 miles, and via Halifax, is 600 miles shorter than by any route through the United States. Steamers owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company are running regularly between Yokohama and Vancouver, and a monthly mail service between Vancouver and Hong Kong, via Yokohama, which has been subsidised by the Imperial and Dominion Government to the extent of $300,000, has been established.

Telegraphs.

There are 37,808 miles of telegraph line, and 103,196 miles of wire in operation in Canada, of which 6,982, including 397 miles of cables, are owned and operated by the Dominion Government; 5,963,287 messages were sent in 1904 (not including weather and shipping reports), and the number of offices was 3,161, being one to every 1,798 of the population. Canada ranks seventh in actual telegraphic mileage among the various countries of the world, and first with respect to the number of offices in proportion to population. There is direct cable communication with Great Britain, Newfoundland, and Bermuda, and also a deep-sea cable between Vancouver Island and the United States. In the latter part of 1902 telegraphic communication was opened up between Canada and the Australian Colonies by the Pacific Ocean Cable. The telephone is very generally used. The Select Committee of the House of Commons, in April, 1905, reported that there were 81 telephone companies in Canada. Of these, 46 reported to the Statistical Office. Compilation of the reports showed that the 46 had 94,820 sets of instruments; 214,405 miles of wire, and nearly 291,000,000 connections.

There were, in 1905, 365 electric light companies in Canada, having 14,891 arc lamps and 1,599,592 incandescent lights. Every Province of the Dominion is supplied with the electric light.

Canals.

There are six important systems of Government canals, affording, with the St. Lawrence River connections, magnificent inland communications. The total length of canals proper open is 2624 miles, but the aggregate length of inland navigation rendered available by them is 3,000 miles, the St. Lawrence system alone having a length of 2,384 miles. The receipts in 1905 were $78,009, and the working expenses, including repairs, $833,242. Over ninety-six million dollars have been expended on the construction, enlargement and repairs of these canals, including the amount expended on the Sault Ste. Marie Canal to connect Lakes Superior and Huron, which was opened in the season of 1895.

The Canal tolls were abolished by way of experiment in 1903, and have not yet been reimposed.

Currency and Banking.

There is an uniform currency throughout the Dominion, consisting of dollars, cents, and mills, $4:36¢ being equal to one pound sterling. In addition to this Canadian coinage, the gold coins of the United States are also legal tender.

The Savings Banks, under the charge of the Government, on 30th June, 1905, numbered 1,011, and there were 213,683 depositors with $62,017,457 on deposit. There are two savings banks operating under special charter, and these had on deposit $25,050,966. In addition all the 34 chartered banks have savings banks branches, but the returns to the Government do not specify the amounts on deposits in these branches.

The following banks are established in Canada, on 30th June, 1906:

Ontario—(Headquarters).
Bank of Toronto. Bank of Hamilton.
Dominion Bank. Western Bank.
Standard Bank. Traders' Bank.
Imperial Bank. Sovereign Bank of Canada.
Bank of Ottawa. Home Bank of Canada.
Ontario Bank. Sterling Bank of Canada.
Metropolitan Bank. Canadian Bank of Commerce.

Quebec—(Headquarters).
Bank of Montreal. Provincial Bank.

Nova Scotia—(Headquarters).
Bank of Nova Scotia. Union Bank.
Royal Bank of Canada.

Other Provinces—(Headquarters).
Bank of New Brunswick; People's Bank, N.B.; St. Stephen's Bank, N.B.; Northern Bank, Manitoba.

These banks had, on 1st January, 1905, 1,145 branches, distributed as under: Ontario, 549; Quebec, 196; Nova Scotia, 101; New Brunswick, 49; British Columbia, 55; Prince Edward Island, 10; Manitoba, 95; N.W. Territories, 87; Yukon, 3.

The paid-up banking capital has more than doubled since 1870. In June of that year it was $32,950,597, and in June, 1906, it was $91,074,505. The bank note circulation on 30th June, 1906, was $69,366,505. In 1877 they held $69,763,663 of deposits, and, on June 30th, 1906, they held $884,113,731. In addition to the notes issued by the chartered banks, the Government issues notes of various denominations, and the average monthly circulation in 1890 amounted to $15,501,360, and in 1905 to $48,714,641. The Dominion Government by statute must always hold, as security for the redemption of Dominion notes issued and outstanding up to and including thirty million dollars, an amount in gold or in gold and guaranteed securities of Canada equal to not less than 25 per cent. of the amount of such notes, the gold held to be not less than 15 per cent. of the amount. To secure issue of notes in excess of thirty millions it must hold dollar in gold for dollar in notes. No notes are issued below five dollars except by the Government.

Post Office.

The number of letters sent in Canada in the year ended 30th June, 1905, was 285,541,000, of postcards 29,941,000. The number of offices was
The revenue for 1905 was $6,786,090, and the expenditure $6,295,245.

There is weekly mail communication with Great Britain, via Quebec in summer, and Halifax in winter, fortnightly with the West Indies and Demerara, and four a week via New York. There is a through daily service by the Canadian Pacific Railway to the Pacific coast, a monthly direct steam service with Australia (with the exception of Western Australia), via Vancouver, and once every three weeks via San Francisco, and a tri-weekly steam service with Japan and China, via Vancouver, from April to September inclusive, and once every four weeks during the rest of the year.

The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters, Newspapers per ½ oz. | Papers |
|-------------------------------|--------|
| Canada and U.S.               | 2      | 1 per 4 oz. |
| U.K., India, Newfoundland, and certain other Colonies* | 2      | 1 per 4 oz. |
| Elsewhere                     | 5      | 1           |

There is a parcel post to Newfoundland, West Indies, Australia, United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Hong Kong, and Japan.

**Defence.**

There is an Imperial naval station at Halifax, N.S., which is strongly fortified, and garrisoned by a Canadian force. The defence of the Dominion rests with the local forces. The Canadian Militia since confederation has, in accordance with the Canadian Militia Act, been under the immediate command of a Major-General of the English Army. The Dominion is divided, for military purposes, into twelve districts, with a District Officer Commanding, and a Brigade Staff in charge of each. The active Militia numbers about 55,765 men. There are two royal schools of artillery (one field, one garrison); two schools of cavalry, and one of mounted rifles, and five of infantry, and the Dominion Government in 1876 opened a school of scientific military instruction at Kingston, known as "The Royal Military College," with a staff of 12 professors.

According to the Census of 1901—the comparisons with 1891 being added—Canada had of males of military age:

| Age Group | 1901 | 1891 |
|-----------|------|------|
| 20 years to 24 years | 256,981 | 237,144 |
| 25        | 20   | 216,334 | 194,531 |
| 30        | 34   | 188,125 | 163,866 |
| 35        | 39   | 172,551 | 139,899 |
| 40        | 44   | 152,036 | 118,954 |
| 20        | 45   | 986,027 | 854,394 |

Esquimalt, in British Columbia, has become an important coaling station, and is strongly fortified and garrisoned by Canadian troops, the Dominion Government paying the cost.

III. THE PROVINCES.

ONTARIO AND QUEBEC (OLD CANADA).

History.

Canada was discovered by Sebastian Cabot in 1497. In 1525, the French took possession of the country in the name of the King of France, and ten years later Cartier explored the St. Lawrence, so naming that splendid river from having entered it on St. Lawrence's day.

In 1608 Quebec, the first settlement, was founded. During their early days and for a considerable time after, the French settlers were few in number, suffered great hardships, and were much engaged in conflicts with the Indian tribes, the aboriginal inhabitants. The principal incentives to their colonisation were the profits of the fur trade and missionary zeal.

In 1759 Quebec succumbed to the British forces under General Wolfe; and in 1763 the whole territory of Canada was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Paris. It may be mentioned that for three years, from 1629 to 1632, Quebec had been in English possession, having been captured by David Kirk, but was retroceded to France by the peace of St. Germain-en-laye.

From 1763 to 1774 Canada was governed by military authority, until in the latter year a nominee council was established by Act of the Parliament of Great Britain. By the same Act the Roman Catholics were given the free exercise of their religion; the Catholic clergy were declared entitled to receive their accustomed dues and rights, but with respect only to those professing the Catholic religion; and in civil cases it was declared that resort should be had to the Laws of Canada for the decision of the same.

In 1791 an Act of Parliament was passed (31 Geo. III., cap. 31), dividing Canada into two Provinces, Upper Canada (now Ontario) and Lower Canada (now Quebec), and establishing a constitution for each. As the form of government was similar in each Province, a description of that of the Lower Province will suffice. By the Act in question the Legislative authority was vested in a Legislative Council appointed by the Crown, and in a House of Assembly elected by the inhabitants; the Lower Province was under a Governor, whilst the Upper was under a Lieutenant-Governor. Both the Houses of Assembly thus created, and especially that of Lower Canada, were in constant conflict with the Executive Government from the end of the American War in 1814, until the Canadian Rebellion of 1838. The most fruitful causes of dissension were the right of the Assembly to control public expenditure, and the question of the "Clergy Reserves," lands appropriated by the Imperial Act of 1791 for the exclusive benefit of the Anglican clergy. The immediate exciting cause of the Rebellion was the establishing, by Governor Sir John Colborne (Lord Seaton), of 37 rectories in Upper Canada. After the reduction of the insurgents, the constitution of Lower Canada was suspended, and Lord Durham was sent out from England as Governor-General, with special powers and instructions to report on the affairs of the country. He recommended a Union of the Provinces, and indeed foreshadowed the larger confederation, which has since been adopted. In accordance with Lord Durham's recommendation, the two Provinces were re-united by Act 3 & 4 Vic., cap. 35, and the Legislative Bodies of the united Provinces were consolidated: the
new Legislative Council was to consist of not less than 20 members (it used in fact to exceed double that number); the members were appointed for life. The new House of Assembly consisted of 84 members, there being an equal number from each Province. Municipal Institutions were established in Canada in 1841.

**Constitution.**

The constitution of Canada in operation under this union was defined in its main features under title I. of the Local Consolidated Stat., 1839. Canada was divided into 125 electoral districts and boroughs, returning in all 130 members to the House of Assembly, 65 for Upper Canada, and 65 for Lower Canada; whilst the Legislative Council consisted of 48 elected members, and 22 members nominated under the old constitution.

In 1854 the question of the "Clergy Reserves" was settled by the application of the property to municipal purposes, vested interests being respected. In the same year seignorial tenure was abolished in Lower Canada.

As years passed, increasing difficulty was experienced in the conduct of public affairs owing to the antagonism of the members for Upper and Lower Canada. Things having come almost to a "deadlock" about 1864, an escape from the difficulty was sought in a project for the union of all the British North American provinces, which, after negotiation, was agreed to, and embodied in the "British North America Act, 1867."

Each Province now enjoys responsible government, under a Lieut.-Governor in Council, advised by five or more Cabinet Ministers. There is an elected Legislative Assembly in each (Ontario, 98 members; Quebec, 74 members), elected for four years by manhood suffrage, with no property qualification. Members in Ontario are paid mileage and $6 per day for 30 days, or a maximum of $800. Quebec also possesses a Legislative Council or Upper House of 24 members, who hold their seats for life, nominated by the Lieut.-Governor in Council. The members are paid $6 per day while the session lasts, and their travelling expenses.

**Industry.**

The land in both Ontario and Quebec is very fertile, and produces all cereals and wheat crops in abundance; fruit grows luxuriantly; and grapes, melons, peaches and tomatoes come to maturity in the open air. In 1901, Canada ranked first in the shipment of cheese to Great Britain, supplying over one-half of the total imports of the article.

The lumber trade is extensive; and manufactures of hardware and textile fabrics are largely carried on.

**Education.**

In Ontario the central control is vested in the Minister of Education, who is a member of the Provincial Cabinet. General regulations are framed by him with the approval of the Government for both the elementary (public) and high schools, of which there are 6,381, with 474,753 scholars in 1904. Both kinds of schools are under the control of local boards of trustees, are required to have only certificated teachers, and are efficiently inspected. There is a provincial (non-denominational) university (Toronto), with an affiliated university college, and four theological colleges are also affiliated, and one university is confederated. There are also four denominational colleges with university powers in the Province, and numerous high schools or colleges for girls. Ample provision is made for the instruction of the deaf and dumb and the blind. There is also a well-equipped agricultural college, now affiliated with the provincial university. Schools are attached to the reformatories for juvenile criminals of both sexes. Primary education is free and compulsory. Mechanics' institutions, as well as collegiate institutions, receive Government grants. All the public institutions are non-sectarian.

In Quebec the Superintendent of Public Instruction, assisted by a council of 35 members, is invested with the central control of education. The council is divided into committees for the management of Roman Catholic and Protestant schools respectively. The local control is vested in local boards or in the curé and churchwardens of the parish. The schools are maintained partly by local taxation and fees, and partly by grants from the Provincial Government. There were, in 1904, 6,043 schools, with 337,933 scholars, including the high and superior schools, and three normal schools supported by the State. There are also schools of agriculture, commercial and classical schools, and three universities—two Protestant, McGill College, Montreal, and Bishop's College, Lennoxville, and one, the Laval University, Roman Catholic.

The following table gives some information respecting the public, high, and superior schools in Canada, also the amount expended for education:

| Provinces | Schools | Teachers | Pupils | Expenditure |
|-----------|---------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Ontario   | 6,381   | 10,284   | 474,753| 5,459,493    |
| Quebec    | 6,319   | 10,829   | 337,933| 2,424,832    |
| Nova Scotia (1905) | 2,449 | 2,636   | 102,178| 993,844      |
| New Brunswick | 1,737 | 1,868   | 60,006 | 631,818      |
| Manitoba  | 1,674   | 2,240   | 60,432 | 1,786,311    |

| Territories | 743 | 1,152   | 33,191 | 213,764      |

**Chief Towns, Area, and Population.**

Besides those mentioned above, in the statistics of the Dominion, the chief towns are, in Ontario, Owen Sound, Galt, Brockville, Berlin, Peterborough and Woodstock; and in Quebec, St. Hyacinthe, St. Cunegonde, Three Rivers and Levis, with from 8,000 to 10,000 inhabitants each. The area of the two Provinces, including water, is 612,735 square miles—Ontario 260,862, and Quebec 351,873.* The population according to the last census was—Ontario 2,182,947, and Quebec 1,648,898.

**Climate.**

The climate is dry, bracing, and very healthy, although the range of temperature is great. The mean temperature at Toronto is 45°, at Montreal 42°; the extreme range being from 12° below zero to 91°. The average annual rainfall at Toronto is 26 inches; at Montreal 27 inches, principally from May to September. The snowfall between December and March is considerable.

* The northern boundaries of Quebec were extended by Federal Parliament Act, cap. 3, 1898, and Quebec Legislature Act, cap. 6, 1898.

NOVA SCOTIA.

Situation, Area, and Population.

Nova Scotia is a peninsula between 43° 46' N. lat., and 61° 67' W. long., connected with New Brunswick by an isthmus about 14 miles wide; its length is about 300 miles, and its breadth about 100 at its widest, with much variation. The island of Cape Breton, separated by the Gut of Canso, forms part of the Province. It contains an area of 20,907 square miles, about one-fifth part of which consists of lakes, rivers, and inlets of the sea. The population at the last census was 459,674.
History.

Nova Scotia was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was colonised by the French in 1598; was taken by the English, and a grant of it made to Sir W. Alexander, by James I., in 1621. In 1632 it was restored to France, with Quebec, by the Treaty of St. Germain-en-laye, but again ceded to England at the Peace of Utrecht in 1714. After the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, a settlement of disbanded troops was formed there by Lord Halifax, and the city which now bears his name is the capital of that province. Cape Breton was not finally taken from the French until 1758. From 1784 to 1819 it formed a separate colony.

Description.

Halifax is the capital; population at the last census 40,832. Its harbour is open at all seasons, and is not surpassed by any in the world, affording safe anchorage for at least 1,000 ships. The British Government has an extensive dockyard at this city, which is its principal naval and military station in North America. A dry dock is also situated at Halifax capable of accommodating the largest ships.

There are many other fine harbours which are able to afford shelter to the largest vessels. There is no point in the province distant over thirty miles from a good seaport.

Some of the other chief towns are: Annapolis, Antigonish, Digby, Kentville, Truro, Yarmouth, Pictou, Windsor, Sydney (in Cape Breton), Amherst, Lunenburg, and Liverpool.

Extensive iron and steel works are established at Sydney, and this city is developing very rapidly.

Minerals of almost all kinds abound. The production of the principal minerals, that are at present mined, for the year ended 30th September, 1905, is as follows:

| Mineral     | Quantity |
|-------------|----------|
| Gold        | 15,550 ozs. |
| Iron ore    | 73,600 tons. |
| Coal raised | 5,050,420 " |
| Gypsum      | 197,292 "   |
| Limestone   | 274,002 "   |
| Barytes     | 4,500 "     |

There are large deposits of copper and other minerals which have not, as yet, been commercially mined.

The greater portion of the inhabitants are engaged in agriculture and the growth of fruit, for which the province is well adapted. Apples of different varieties and of very superior quality are extensively grown and exported to England and other parts of Europe.

A large quantity of wood pulp is manufactured and exported, principally to England; the conditions prevailing are well suited for this industry, which is rapidly growing.

The fisheries of the province are very valuable. The value of the catch of fish in 1903 was $7,841,602. There are many establishments for canning and preserving lobsters and drying and preserving other fish.

The timber trade is carried on to a considerable extent; England is the chief customer, but shipments are also made to other parts of Europe. Spruce and pine are the principal kinds of timber manufactured and exported.

There are a number of shipyards for the building of wooden vessels, and the establishment of a plant for the construction of steel ships is proposed, and will probably be proceeded with in the near future; large bonuses are offered to encourage the establishment of such plant.

The climate is remarkably healthy and more temperate than that of any other part of the Dominion. The mean temperature at Halifax is 65°, the extreme range being from 11° below zero to 88°.

Constitution.

Nova Scotia is represented in the Dominion Parliament by 12 Members in the Senate and 18 Members in the House of Commons.

The local government is administered by a Lieut.-Governor, advised by an Executive Council of nine members (three of whom are departmental heads), responsible to the Legislature, which consists of a Legislative Council of 21 members appointed by the Governor for life, and a House of Assembly of 38 representatives elected every five years. The Members are paid $500 sessional indemnity.

Education.

The present system of elementary education was established by law in 1865. The central control is vested in the Council of Public Instruction—a body identical in membership with the Executive Council of the Province. The local management of schools is vested, so far as the ordinary school sections or districts are concerned, in a Board of Trustees chosen by the ratepayers of the section or district. But in incorporated towns, the powers of trustees are exercised by the Town Council, or a committee thereof.

In 1901 there were 2,492 schools in operation, with a gross attendance of 98,410 pupils. Education is compulsory, i.e., non-attendance exposes to pecuniary penalties between the ages of 7 and 12.

NEW BRUNSWICK.

Situation, Area, and Population.

New Brunswick is situated between 44° 40' and 48° 5' N. lat., and 63° 30' and 69° W. long.; its area is 27,177 square miles, or about 17,393,410 acres. It is connected with Nova Scotia by a low isthmus. The population on 1st July, 1901, was 331,120.

History.

New Brunswick was part of the ancient French Province of Acadia and was ceded to England by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Great Britain, however, did not obtain full possession of the country until after the fall of Quebec in 1759. It was first colonised by British subjects from New England in 1762, and in 1783, at the close of the Revolutionary War, it received a large body of Loyalists from the Thirteen Colonies. In 1784 it was separated from Nova Scotia, of which it had formed a part.

Climate.

The mean temperature of St. John is 41°, the extreme range being from 19° below zero to 85°. The average annual rainfall is 40 inches, and the snowfall 76 inches, the latter extending from November to April inclusive.

Industries.

Coal is abundant. Recent valuable discoveries of oil have been made; copper and gypsum exist in large quantities. There are also several salt springs, from which excellent salt is manufactured, and antimony, iron, and manganese have been found in considerable quantities. There are also vast deposits of rich bituminous shale, which is likely to have a good commercial value. A great portion of the country is covered by dense forests of fine timber, the cutting and working of which—or "lumbering"—furnishes remunerative employment to many. Wheat, Indian corn, barley, buckwheat, and oats, are the principal cereals raised. Apples and plums of excellent quality are largely grown, also strawberries, raspberries, and other small fruits. The fisheries are extensive, both sea and river. Some of the finest salmon fishing in the world is to be had in this province. Fredericton, 65 miles inland, is the capital (pop. 7,117), but St. John, on the mouth of the river of the same name, is the leading commercial centre (pop. 40,711). Other towns are Moncton (9,026), Chatham (4,868), Woodstock (2,984), and St. Stephen (2,840).

Constitution.

New Brunswick is represented in the Canadian Senate by 10 Members, and sends 13 Members to the House of Commons.

There is a Legislative Assembly of 46 Members, elected under a liberal franchise. An Act was passed in 1891 abolishing the Legislative Council from the end of the then present Parliament, and the Council came to an end with the dissolution of 1892.

Members receive $500 per session, and their travelling expenses.

Education.

A system of elementary education was established by Act, 1871. The central control is vested in a Board of Education, and the local management is in the hands of Boards of School Trustees. Education is free between the ages of 6 and 20. There were 1,750 schools, with 60,400 scholars in attendance in 1905.

There is a university at Fredericton, also at Sackville, and a college at Memramcook.

MANITOBA.

Situation and Area.

Manitoba was created into a Province with Representative Institutions by an Act of the Canadian Parliament, 33 Vict., c. 3, taking effect on 15th July, 1870. By this Act, the boundaries of Manitoba are defined as 49°-50° 30' N. latitude, and 96°-99° W. longitude, its area being 13,500 square miles.

By the Canadian Act 44 Vict., c. 14, these boundaries were extended, and fixed at 49°-53° N. lat., and 90°-101° W. long., comprising an area of 73,956 square miles, with a population in 1881 of 62,260, which had grown to 154,442 in 1891, and 254,947 in 1901.

The territory between the 49th parallel, the meridian of the N.W. angle of the Lake of the Woods, English River, Lone Lake, Lake St. Joseph, and 90° W. longitude, which had been supposed to belong to Manitoba, was in 1884 declared to form part of Ontario.

History.

Manitoba was formerly known as the Red River Settlement of the Hudson's Bay Company. Upon the surrender of the Charter of that Company to the Crown, with a view of the inclusion of Rupert's Land in the Dominion, many of the inhabitants of the Red River Settlement, incited by disaffected persons, rose in insurrection, and established a Provisional Government of their own, headed by Louis Riel, a half-breed. On the 4th of March, 1870, Riel, Lepine, and other leaders of this insurrection, having previously imprisoned 39 Canadians, shot a man named Scott, who had been opposed to them.

The insurrection itself ended by the flight of the leaders upon the approach of Sir Garnet Wolseley with a military force from Canada.

In October, 1871, the Province was threatened by a Fenian raid, but it was arrested by the United States Commander at Fort Pembina on the International Boundary.

In 1874 Lepine was brought to trial at Fort Garry for the murder of Scott, and was, upon conviction, sentenced to death. But Lord Dufferin, with the acquiescence of the Secretary of State, commuted his sentence to two years' imprisonment, with loss of political rights.

Description.

The agricultural capabilities of the province of Manitoba are very great. The soil is a rich, black loam, the surface deposit showing a very high content of nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash. It is, therefore, peculiarly adapted to the growth of cereal grains, and owing largely to the presence of the element nitrogen in large quantities, wheat possessing a high percentage of gluten is produced. "Manitoba No. 1 Hard," because of its superior milling qualities is in great demand by English millers, and has made the province famous.

The principal agricultural exports of the country are wheat, oats, beef, cattle and dairy products. In 1904 there were over 55,000 farmers in the province, who had in crop 4,256,838 acres, consisting as follows:

| Crop       | Acres     |
|------------|-----------|
| Wheat      | 2,643,588 |
| Oats       | 1,031,239 |
| Barley     | 432,298   |
| Flax, etc. | 33,774    |
| Potatoes   | 25,835    |
| Roots      | 13,411    |

The average yield of wheat per acre for ten years is 18-38 bushels per acre, and it is estimated that the province is capable of sustaining 30,000,000 of people. Free grant lands are still available in several districts into which new railways are being projected. Good farms within easy reach of a railway may be purchased at from $8 to $20 per acre.

The growth of Winnipeg, the principal city, is remarkable. In 1870 it contained about 200 inhabitants, and in 1881 it had a population of about 10,000; in 1896, 35,000; and now it is over 100,000. The other chief towns of the province are Brandon, Portage la Prairie, Neepawa, Emerson, Carman, Selkirk, Carberry, Minnedosa, Morden, Souris, Virden, and St. Boniface.

Coal of the lignite variety is to be found in the Souris Valley. Several brick manufacturing plants have been established throughout the province, and the manufacturing of cement for building purposes has proved to be successful.

Owing to the cost of power for manufacturing purposes few large manufacturing industries have yet become established. Within the last year, however, companies have been organized for the development of electric power on the Winnipeg River, and its transmission to the city of Winnipeg, where it is believed manufacturing industries are likely to develop. One company is now in operation, and its power utilized within the city.

Railway Facilities.

In the year 1879 there was no railway at all in the whole of the country between Lake Superior and the Rocky Mountains.

In the year 1904 there were in the province of Manitoba alone 3,000 miles of railway, which afford easy access to market from all parts of the Province.

Climate.

The mean temperature at Winnipeg is only 33°, the extreme range being from 40° below zero to 95°, but the climate is bracing and healthy. The average annual rainfall is over 17 inches, and snowfall (November to March), 53 inches.

Constitution.

Manitoba is represented by 4 members in the Dominion Senate and 10 members in the House of Commons.

The Province has a Legislative Assembly of 40 members elected by manhood suffrage for 4 years. The Legislative Council or Upper Chamber was abolished by a local Act passed in 1876.

The members of the Legislative Assembly are paid $500 per session, and their travelling expenses.

Education.

A system of elementary education was established by law in 1871. The central control was in the hands of a Board of Education, divided into two sections, Protestant and Catholic respectively. The local management was entrusted to school trustees elected by the people.

By the "Public Schools Act" of 1890, all the previous School Acts were repealed, and a system of national non-sectarian schools was established throughout the Province. This Act provides
"that all public schools shall be free schools, and that every person in rural municipalities between the ages of 5 and 21 years, and in cities, towns, and villages between the ages of 6 and 21 years shall have the right to attend some school."

In 1905 there were 1,761 schools in operation, employing 2,272 teachers, of whom 597 were men, and 1,675 women.

Normal schools are provided for the training of teachers.

There is one University, styled "The University of Manitoba," with examining and degree-conferring powers only. The affiliated colleges are St. John's (Episcopal), St. Boniface (Roman Catholic), Manitoba (Presbyterian), Wesley (Wesleyan), the Manitoba Medical, and Brandon (Baptist) College.

BRITISH COLUMBIA.

Situation and Area.

British Columbia is situated on the north-west coast of North America, and comprises the territory bounded on the north by the 60th parallel, on the east by the 120th meridian down to the 54th parallel, thence by summit of Rocky Mountains to the 49th parallel, on the south by the United States, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean—the average breadth being about 450 miles, and the length of coast line over 1,000 miles. The area (including Vancouver and Queen Charlotte Islands) is about 383,000 square miles, and the population, at the census of 1891, was 98,173, and at that of 1901, 190,000.

History.

British Columbia was constituted a Crown colony in 1858, owing to the large immigration consequent on the discovery of gold in that year. Vancouver Island was leased to the Hudson's Bay Company in 1843, and made a Crown colony in 1849. In 1866 the colonies of British Columbia and Vancouver Island were united, and on July 20, 1871, British Columbia entered the Canadian Confederation, and is represented by three members in the Senate, and seven in the House of Commons, of Canada.

Constitution.

The Provincial Government is administered by a Lieutenant-Governor and legislative assembly of 42 members on the system of executive administration known as a "responsible government." The assembly is elected for four years, every British male adult having resided six months in the province, duly registered, being entitled to vote. Members receive $800 for the session, and their travelling expenses.

Description.

The population is about 250,000, of whom 29,000 are Indians, 13,000 Chinese, and 4,600 Japanese.

The vast tract comprised within the limits of the province—extending as it does through nearly 12 degrees of latitude with a varying breadth and elevation—naturally affords a great diversity of climate.

The coast region has been described as "having a climate wonderfully like that of the South of England, only the summers are much drier." The warm, tropical waters of the Pacific Gulf Stream (Japan current) striking the coast give to Vancouver Island and the coast generally a mild and agreeable climate; there is little frost or snow, and there is a difference of at least 10 degrees of latitude in favour of places on the coast as compared with corresponding positions on the Atlantic coast. The interior is subject to greater extremes both of heat and cold, but nowhere are the extremes so great as on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains; the climate is for the most part drier, and the snowfall consequently less.

The trade of the province is developing rapidly; the exports amount to over eighteen million dollars annually (a remarkable fact considering the number of the population); they consist of minerals (chiefly gold, silver, copper and coal), sea products (chiefly salmon and oil), timber, furs, skins, etc. The imports amount to upwards of ten million dollars, principally from Eastern Canada, England, the United States, China, Australia, etc.

The mineral production of the Province to the end of 1905 amounts in value to $248,663,176, towards which sum coal has contributed $73,786,754.

A great advance has been made in metalliferous mining; the oldest districts have increased their production, while new fields have been opened up; this advance is clearly shown by the increase in the production since 1896, which is as follows: 1896, $4,257,179; 1902, $12,174,242. Total output of metalliferous mines for 1903, $16,964,084; 1904, $18,377,359; 1905, $22,461,325. There has been a corresponding increase in the population; some of these new mining districts, which a year or two ago were only inhabited by a few hardy prospectors, are now dotted with active and prosperous mining towns.

The chief towns are Victoria (26,000), and Nanaimo, city and neighbourhood (6,100), the seat of the coal-mining industry on Vancouver Island. On the mainland, New Westminster (6,500), and Vancouver (30,000), Rossland (6,100), Trail, (1,500) Nelson (5,200), Kaslo (2,100), Sandon (800). These towns are in West Kootenay. On the Canadian Pacific Railway, Kamloops (1,700), Ashcroft, Revelstoke, and Golden are thriving places. Esquimalt, V.I., is a coaling station, and is the site of a large dry dock.

Education.

A complete system of free education was established by Act No. 16 of 1872. The central control is vested in the Council of Public Instruction composed of the members of the Executive Council. The Minister of Education directs the general management of the schools through the Superintendent of Education. In each rural school district three trustees are elected to attend to the local affairs of the school, and in city school districts seven, five or three (according to grade, whether first, second or third class) trustees are elected for this purpose.

There are at present 13 high schools in the Province, employing 37 teachers.

The number of schools in operation in 1904-1905 was 361, under 658 teachers, with an enrolment of 27,354 pupils.

The schools are free and non-sectarian. The highest morality must be inculcated, but no religious dogma nor creed is permitted to be taught.

School districts are formed wherever there are twenty children between the ages of six and sixteen years available for school purposes.

PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND.

Situation and Area.

This island, which was admitted into union with the Dominion of Canada on the 1st July, 1873, is situated almost wholly between 46° and 47° N. lat., and between 62° and 64½° W. long. Its area is 1,356,120 acres, or 2,133 square miles; it is about 130 miles long, and 34 its greatest breadth. It was discovered by Sebastian Cabot, 1497; it was first settled by the French, but was taken from them in 1758. It was annexed to Nova Scotia in 1763, but, on the petition of its inhabitants, was constituted a separate Colony in 1769.

The population at the last census was 103,258.

Description.

The climate is milder than in the neighbouring provinces, and is considered very healthy. The island is generally well wooded and watered, and the soil is fertile.

Besides the usual domestic industries of an agricultural people, there are numerous factories;
tanneries, foundries, saw and woollen mills, and establishments for canning and preserving lobsters, fish, etc. Many cheese and butter factories have lately been established.

The waters adjoining comprise by far the most valuable section of the fishing grounds of America, and are very largely resorted to.

The chief towns are Charlottetown (12,080) and Summerside (3,000). A line of railway traverses the island, belonging to, and worked by, the Dominion Government. It is 210 miles in length, including branches. A railway is constructed through Belfast and Murray Harbour (about 50 miles), and one of the longest bridges in Canada is erected across the Hillsboro' River, over which trains and carriages run. New branch railways are built to Montague and Vernon River Bridge.

**Constitution.**

Responsible Government was established in Prince Edward Island in 1851. There is a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General, an Executive Council (the Cabinet) of 9 members, and a Legislative Assembly of 30 elected members.

Each member receives a payment of $160 per annum, and $12 for postage, besides travelling expenses.

The island is divided into three counties, King's, Queen's, and Prince's, each of which elects ten representatives to the Assembly. The island is also represented in the Dominion Parliament by four members in the Senate and four in the House of Commons.

**Education.**

A system of general education is established by law. The central control is vested in a Board of Education, appointed by the Executive Government, and the local management is in the hands of a chief superintendent. Education is free, non-sectarian, and compulsory between the ages of 8 and 13 years. There are 474 schools, with 20,779 scholars. There is one higher college amalgamated with the normal school. In addition to the above there is also a Roman Catholic College not under the control of the Government. There are also two private Kindergartens. A new consolidated school is opened at Hillsboro' through the benevolence of Sir William McDonald, of Montreal, a native of the island. Another is opened at Tryon by the people themselves.

**Finance.**

The province has a large sum to its credit, from which it draws interest. There is a provincial tax on Land and Incomes, and a Succession Duty. There is also a Road Tax in the country, and municipal rates in the towns.

PROVINCES OF SASKATCHEWAN AND ALBERTA AND THE NORTH-WEST TERRITORIES.

By a Canadian Act, 38 Vict., cap. 49, the territories formerly known as "Rupert's Land" and the North-Western Territory, were, with the exception of such portions thereof as form the Province of Manitoba and the district of Keewatin, called and known as the North-West Territories, and were created into a Government entirely separate and distinct from Manitoba. The Act was put into force by Proclamation of 7th October, 1876. The Territories were governed by a Lieutenant-Governor, aided by an Executive Council.

In 1888, election by popular vote was applied to the Assembly, 22 members being returned, representing the Territories included in the Provisional Districts of Alberta, Assiniboia, and Saskatchewan. In September, 1894, these districts were reorganised under a local ordinance and divided into 29 electoral districts, each returning one member to the Legislative Assembly, from among whom an Executive Committee, consisting of 4 members, was chosen to aid and advise the Lieutenant-Governor in connection with certain strictly defined matters relating to the government of the Territories. In 1898 the number of electoral districts was increased to 31, and in 1902 still further increased to 35. The Assembly elected its own Speaker. By an amendment to the Act in 1897 an Executive Council was authorised to assume office on 1st October, 1897, the members thereof being obliged to receive the approval of their constituents. This body advised the Lieutenant-Governor upon all matters appertaining to local administration in the Territories. The Territories have rapidly grown in wealth and importance in recent years, and immigration has been largely on the increase.

A portion of the Territories was organised in 1882 into four provisional districts, viz., Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Athabasca. The boundaries of these districts were defined as follows:

Assiniboia, bounded on the east by Manitoba, on the north by latitude 52, on the west by longitude 111½, and on the south by latitude 49 (89,535 sq. miles).

Saskatchewan, bounded on the south by Manitoba and Assiniboia, on the east by Lake Winnipeg and Nelson River, on the north by latitude 55, and on the west by longitude 111½ (107,092 sq. miles).

Alberta, bounded on the south by latitude 49, on the east by Assiniboia and Saskatchewan, on the north by latitude 55 and on the west by British Columbia (106,100 sq. miles).

Athabasca, bounded on the south by Alberta, on the east by longitude 111½ and the Athabasca River, on the north by latitude 60, and on the west by British Columbia (104,500 sq. miles).

By chapters 3 and 27 of the Acts of 1905, these four provisional districts were formed into the two provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and were admitted into the Dominion as such on the 1st September, 1905. The dividing line runs North and South. Alberta has an area of 253,540 square miles, and Saskatchewan of 250,560 square miles.

Each of these provinces is now governed by a Lieutenant-Governor, with the assistance of an Executive Council. Each is represented in the Senate of Canada by 4 members, which number may after the next decennial census be increased to 6, and in the Dominion House of Commons there are 10 members for the two Provinces—provision being made for increase hereafter in accordance with population statistics. There is also a local Legislative Assembly, each consisting of 25 members. Further information will be found under the heading of Constitution of the Dominion, above.

The seat of Government of the province of Saskatchewan is at Regina, and of Alberta at Edmonton.

The North-West Territories now consist of the districts of Ungava, Franklin, MaKenzie, and other territories not included in any province or within the boundaries of the Yukon district. The Territories are governed by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor-General, with a Council of not more than four members, also appointed by the Governor-General, and the Commissioner in Council is empowered to make ordinances for the Territories.

The boundaries of the Yukon district were more closely defined by a Proclamation of the 16th August, 1897. By an Act of the Dominion Parliament, 61–62 Vict., cap. 6, the Yukon Provisional District was declared and constituted a separate Territory, arrangements being made for its local administration by a Commissioner under instructions given by Order in Council or the Minister of the Interior.

The population of the North-West was (1901) 178,084; but, owing to immigration, more particularly from the United States, the records of the Dominion Government show that the population has nearly trebled since the census of 1901.

The remarks as to the agricultural capabilities of Manitoba apply also to the North-West. The extreme range of temperature is somewhat less, and the mean temperature slightly higher, at Alberta than at Winnipeg. Free grants of land of 160 acres can be obtained. It is estimated that there are over 150,000,000 acres of land suitable for cultivation and awaiting settlement.
