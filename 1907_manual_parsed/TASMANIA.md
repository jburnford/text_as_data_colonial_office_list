TASMANIA.

General Description.
Tasmania is an island at the southern extremity of the continent of Australia, from which it is divided by Bass' Straits, 120 miles wide, the important colony of Victoria being on the other side of the straits. It lies between 40° 33' and 43° 39' S. lat., and 144° 39' and 148° 23' E. long.

History.
Tasmania was discovered in 1642 by the Dutch navigator, Abel Jan Tasman, and by him named Van Diemen's Land, the name by which it was known down to 1853. It was not discovered to be an island until 1797. It was formally taken possession of by England in 1803, and made auxiliary to the penal settlement at Botany Bay. The first free emigrants arrived in 1816, and the last convicts in 1853. Responsible government was introduced in 1856.

Climate.
Tasmania is one of the most healthy of the British possessions, and is never too hot in summer nor too cold in winter for out-door occupations to be carried on; nor is it subject to the droughts experienced in the other Australian States.

The three spring months commence in September, summer in December, autumn in March, and winter in June.

From observations taken at Hobart for 1902 the highest shade temperature recorded was 97° on the 2nd Feb., and the lowest 23° 8' on the 19th July. The mean range for the year was 15° 3'. In 1905 rain fell on 143 days in the year, and the rainfall was a little more than 29° 85 inches.

Means of Communication.
All the principal towns are united by telegraph. There are 1,969 miles of telegraph (with 3,752 miles of wire) open in the State. This excludes 432 miles of cable belonging to the Tasmanian Cable Company. The total cost of telegraph and telephone construction up to 31st Dec., 1905, was 148,619l., the receipts for telegraphs in 1905 being 15,455l. There are also 1,584 miles of telephone, which yield an annual rental of 11,108l.

There is a duplicate electric cable between Tasmania and Victoria, whose land-lines extend to Port Darwin, and thence to England via Java.

The number of messages sent was 493,634, of which 192,662 were cable.

Steamers run between Melbourne and Launceston three times a week. Direct mail steamer from Hobart to Sydney twice a week. Direct mail steamer between Hobart and Melbourne, and Hobart and New Zealand every week. There are also steamers trading between Launceston and the north-west ports of Tasmania and Melbourne every week. The mail steamer from Melbourne to Colombo and London every week; time 32 days via Brindisi. The mail steamer from Sydney to San Francisco and thence to London, via New York, every four weeks; time about 40 days. The mail steamer via Vancouver, once a month. The mail steamer via Brisbane, Batavia, Aden, and Brindisi every four weeks; passage from Tasmania about 55 days. Direct communication is also afforded by the steamers of the Shaw, Savile Co. and New Zealand Shipping Co., one vessel of each Company calling at Hobart every month.

In addition to the above, mails are deposited by Messageries Maritimes de France and by German Line packets once a month.

There are 379 places in Tasmania where post offices are established. The rates of postage are:

| Letters per ½ oz. Newspapers. |
|-----------------------------|
| Within Metropolitan District (13 miles radius from G.P.O.) 1d. ... ½d. |
| Within Australasia ... ... 2d. ... ½d. |
| Europe, United States, &c., ... 2½d. 1d. per 4 oz. |
| and ½d. every additional 2 oz. |

The number of letters and postcards received and despatched was 12,615,971; packets and newspapers, 12,208,377.

Area.
The State contains 26,215 square miles, the main island containing about 15½ million acres of land, and the smaller islands connected with it 1½ million acres; 5,338,953 acres have been sold or granted to settlers by the Crown, leaving in the hands of the Crown land to the amount of 11,439,047 acres, of which 1,259,786 acres are leased by settlers for sheep runs or other purposes.

The adjacent islands are 55 in number, most of them being in 'Bass' Straits. The chief are the Furneaux group, including Flinders Island, Robins Island, King Island, and Bruni and Maria Island on the east coast.
Roads.

The main road from the port of Hobart to Launceston is 123 miles long, passes through the centre of the State, and is maintained in fair order by the various road trusts. All the other main roads are under the control of main road boards, and are constructed and maintained by the Government. The cross and bye roads are under the care of local trustees, and are maintained partly by rates and partly by contributions from the Treasury. In 1904 the maintenance of main roads cost £6,954l., of cross and bye roads £8,814l., in all £35,768l.

Railways.

There are now 618 miles of railway in the State, constructed mainly on the three foot six inch gauge. Of these 618 miles, 462 belong to Government, and cost £3,926,713l., and 155 miles to private companies, and cost £1,119,849l. The total cost of railway construction up to time of last balancing was £5,046,562l., the gross receipts in 1905 being £320,476l., and the working expenses £212,061l., showing a return of 2½ per cent. on the capital.

Land.

The upset price of Crown land fit for agriculture is £1. an acre; the upset price of second-class lands a sum not less than 10s. an acre; and of third-class land a minimum of 5s. per acre.

Under the Crown Lands Act, 1903 (3 Ed. VII., No. 39), any person of the full age of 18 years may select for purchase, by private contract with the Government, one lot of first-class land not exceeding 200 acres, at £1. an acre; 250 acres of second-class land, at not less than 10s. per acre; and 400 acres of third-class land, at not less than 5s. per acre, with one-third added for credit, payable by annual instalments for 14 years. First-class lands must be resided upon for 5 years and improved to the value of £1. per acre before grant can issue, or any person of the age of 18, who has not already selected or purchased under that Act, may take up land, not less than 15 acres, or more than 50 acres, and beyond a deposit of 2d. per acre, no further payment is to be made until the fourth year. But a grant cannot be issued for the land unless improved to the extent of £1. for every acre and resided upon for 5 years, inclusive of the 3 years' free occupation. Second-class lands must be improved to a value of 5s. per acre, and third-class lands to a value of 2s. 6d. per acre, before grant can issue therefor.

Credit is allowed on all purchases above £15.

Industry.

The exports of the island are principally wool, tin, grain, fruit, preserves, gold, copper, hides, skins, and leather, hops, timber, vegetables, and tanning bark.

The land in crop on 1st March, 1906, was 230,232 acres and 404,653 acres permanently artificially sown grasses. There were in the State 206,211 horned cattle, and 1,583,661 sheep.

Tasmania possesses a great source of wealth in her minerals, which are now being turned to good account. Gold, silver, copper, tin, coal, wolfram, and also other minerals are found throughout the island. The principal goldfields are at Beaconsfield, Lefroy, and Mathinna. At Beaconsfield the Tasmania Mine is the main producer. Since the reef was discovered in 1877 up to 31st December, 1905, this mine has produced 634,356 ozs. of gold, and the total amount paid in dividends is £72,672l. At Lefroy several mines are sinking, driving, &c., the total output for the year ending 31st December, 1905, being 732l. ozs. At Mathinna the chief mine is the New Golden Gate, which is being opened out at 1,600 feet level. The total quantity of gold obtained from this mine is 220,870 ozs., value £40,276l., and total amount paid in dividends £35,200l. Silver is found on the west and east coasts. Several large silver mines are in full operation at Zeehan and Dundas, and a smelting plant erected at Zeehan, costing over £7,000l., is now treating a large quantity of ore produced. Total quantity of silver lead ore produced during the year ending 31st December, 1905, amounted to 75,270½ tons, value £246,888l. Copper is also found, chiefly on the west coast, the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company's mine being a large producer. This company has its own smelting and reduction plants, and for the year ending 31st December, 1905, produced 8,610 tons of blister copper, value £704,287l. (ex. value of gold contained). Tin is obtained in various parts of the island, the principal workings being at Mount Bischoff in the north-west and Branxholm and Mount Cameron in the north-east. The Mount Bischoff Company produced during the year ending 31st December, 1905, 1,272 tons, and paid in dividends £57,000l., making a total of £2,024,500l. distributed amongst the shareholders. Coal deposits exist more or less throughout the State, the principal mines being the Cornwall and Mount Nicholas in the north-eastern part. Output for the year ending 31st December, 1905, 51,993 tons, value £44,194l., at pit mouth.

Hobart and Launceston are ports of registry, and had on 31st Dec., 1904, 213 vessels, of 24,717 aggregate tonnage.

Population.

The population in 1881 was 115,705, of whom 61,162 were males, and 54,543 females.

On 5th April, 1891, the population of Tasmania was 146,667, of whom 77,560 were males, and 69,107 females, being 5·60 persons to the square mile. On 31st March, 1901, the population was 172,475, of whom 89,624 were males, and 82,851 females, being to the square mile 5·05. The death-rate of 1904 was 11·04 to the 1,000 of the population. The number of inhabited houses not including tents (1,013) was 31,046. The black aboriginal population is now extinct, but there are on the Furneaux Islands a number of half-breeds (157).

Hobart, on the River Derwent, is a city of considerable size, containing within the Registration boundary 34,989 inhabitants.

Launceston, on the River Tamar, the second town of the State, contains within the Registration boundary a population of 21,705.

Local Government.

Municipal councils were established in Hobart and Launceston in 1855, when responsible government was granted to the Colony, and under the Rural Municipalities Act of 1865 councils have been established in 21 districts. These councils consist of seven elected members, two retiring annually for two successive years and three every third year. The president of the council, called
the Warden, is elected annually by the councillors. The voters for the election of councillors are every male or female over 21 years of age on the assessment roll. There are also 23 Town Boards established in the principal townships in the Police districts. In the districts where there are no municipalities the care of the roads is in the hands of Road Trusts. There are also 20 Water Trusts for the supply of water, and 40 Cemetery Trusts. In Launceston, Hobart, Mersey, Circular Head, Table Cape, Leven, and Strahan, the management of the harbours is in the hands of marine boards. The total revenue of these various bodies, exclusive of Government grants, in 1904 was £258,896, and the expenditure £258,961.

The outstanding local debt on 31st December, 1904, was £905,960.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is British sterling.

There are four banks established in the State—viz., The Commercial Bank of Tasmania, the National Bank of Tasmania, the Union Bank of Australia, the Bank of Australasia, with, together, 40 branches. The total assets on 31st December, 1905, amounted to £3,622,829, deposits £3,713,796. The note circulation on same date amounted to £148,562.

In addition to above there are three saving bank systems, one being located at Hobart, one at Launceston, and one having many branches throughout the State, established by Government in connection with the Post Office Department, total deposits at time of last balancing being £1,332,792.

Education.

State schools for primary education were originally established under a board provided for by Act 27 Vict., No. 11, in 1868. In 1887 the board was superseded by a department under the supervision of a Director of Education, working under the Minister of Lands as Ministerial head. The system is national and compulsory, but free only to children unable to pay fees, with non-sectarian religious instruction. There were 365 State schools in operation on 31st December, 1905, the number of scholars on the rolls 24,043, and the average attendance 14,112.

With a view of encouraging the pursuit of a regular and higher course of education amongst the youth of the State, the University of Tasmania was established in the year 1890, with power to grant scholarships. In all eight scholarships are now awarded annually.

Constitution.

The constitution of Tasmania was settled by local Act (18 Vict., No. 17), constituting "the Parliament of Tasmania," and various amending Acts.

The Legislative Council consists of 18 members, elected for 15 electoral districts. Every member of the Legislative Council holds his seat for six years from the day of his election, at the expiration of which time his seat becomes vacant. The competency of the Council is not affected by vacancies, so long as nine members remain. No judge of the Supreme Court can be a member of the Legislative Council nor any person holding office of profit under the Crown (except responsible Ministers) nor contractors to Government. The qualification for a member is to be 30 years of age, and to be a natural-born or naturalised subject of His Majesty. The qualification for an elector is the possession of a freehold estate of £10, or leasehold of 30l. annual value, or being a graduate of any University in the British Dominions, or Associate of Arts of Tasmania, or qualified legal or medical practitioner, or minister of religion, or an officer of the army or navy, or retired officer of the Tasmanian Volunteer Force.

The House of Assembly consists of 35 members, elected for 35 electoral districts. Any natural-born or naturalised subject of His Majesty can be elected, provided that he is not a judge of the Supreme Court, a person holding office of profit under the Crown (except responsible Ministers), nor a contractor to Government.

The duration of the Assembly is three years. The qualification of an elector for the Assembly is to be a British subject, 21 years old, and resident for 12 months. The Franchise is extended to women. Voting by ballot is regulated by 1st Ed. VII., No. 57. Parliament usually meets in July, and sits for about four months. Members, excepting Ministers and certain officers of Parliament, are paid 100l. Members of the Commonwealth Parliament are disqualified for a seat in either House, and a Minister of the Crown under the Commonwealth cannot hold a post as Minister in Tasmania.

The Governor is advised by a Cabinet of responsible Ministers.
