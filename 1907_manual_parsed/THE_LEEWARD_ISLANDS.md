THE LEEWARD ISLANDS.

Situation and Area.

The Leeward Islands, so called in contrast to the Windward Islands, which are most exposed to the N.E. Trade, the prevailing wind in the West Indies, form the most northerly group of the Lesser Antilles, the whole of which were included among the Windward Islands as the term was used by the Spaniards. Some of them belong to Denmark (part of Virgin Islands), Holland (St. Eustatius, Saba, a part of St. Martin), France (Guadeloupe, Martinique, St. Bartholomew, and part of St. Martin) and the United States (Bieques and Culebra). The English Leeward Islands comprising the Presidencies of Antigua (with its dependencies, Barbuda and Redonda), Montserrat, St. Kitts, and Nevis (including Anguilla), Dominica and the Virgin Islands, were constituted a single Federal Colony by an Act passed in the Imperial Parliament in the Session of 1871, 34 & 35 Vict., cap. 107. The total area of the Colony is 704 square miles, about the size of the county of Surrey, and its population about 129,240.
The island of Sombrero was added to the colony by Order in Council under the Colonial Boundaries Act, on August 10th, 1904.

History.

The islands were discovered by Columbus on his second voyage, in 1493, and became British during the 17th century. Particulars of their subsequent history will be found in the separate articles, but it may here be mentioned, that with the exception of Dominica, they have been from the first associated politically as well as geographically. They were all colonised from St. Kitts as centre, all included in the Carlisle grant, and possessed a common Legislature as far back as the reign of William and Mary. Some Acts passed by that Legislature are still in force in the several islands, notably one "to provide for the want of fines and common recoveries," under which entails and settlements of real property are effected, and which is considered creditable to the sagacity of the Colonists of the day as having anticipated by nearly a century and a half a very beneficial reform only effected in this country in the year 1833, by the Act 3 & 4 Will. IV., c. 74. The General Legislature met for the last time in 1798, when it passed a highly humane slave amelioration Act, which was allowed; a Catholic Emancipation Act, and an Act repealing the duty on exports of 4½ per cent. for the benefit of the English exchequer—both which were disallowed. An attempt was made by Sir William Colebrook in 1837 to revive the General Legislature, and though the attempt was regarded unfavourably in some quarters, and the Legislature never actually met, yet the right to revive it was clear, and there is no doubt that the Act of 1871, the passing of which was largely due to the energy and activity of Sir Benjamin Pine, is no more than a revival of the ancient constitution of the islands. The Colonies of St. Kitts and Nevis, with Anguilla and their respective dependencies, were united into one Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1882.

Climate.

The climate of the islands varies, but is usually dry and fairly healthy. Antigua is subject to drought, and has an average rainfall of about 46 inches; St. Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat have average rainfalls of from 50 to 60 inches; the rainfall of Dominica averages about 120 inches. The mean temperature is about 80°, with but a slight range. The Virgin Islands are cooler. The hot season is from May to October; the rainy season from August to December.

Constitution.

By "The Leeward Islands Act, 1871," one Executive and one Legislative Council, under one Governor, were constituted for the six (now five) presidencies. As reconstituted by the Federal Act No. 1 of 1899, the Legislative Council now consists of eight official and eight elective members. Three elective members are chosen by the unofficial members of the Legislative Council of Antigua, two by those of the Legislative Council of Dominica, and three by those of the Legislative Council of St. Kitts and Nevis. They must be and continue members of their respective island councils. The official members are the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Auditor-General, the Administrators of St. Kitts, Nevis, and Dominica, and the Commissioners of Montserrat and the Virgin Islands.

The Legislative Council has concurrent legislative powers with the local legislatures on certain subjects specified in the Act, such as matters of property, mercantile and criminal law, the law relating to status, the maintenance of a general police force and a common convict establishment, quarantine, postal and telegraph affairs, currency, audit, weights and measures, education and the care of lunatics, all matters relating to immigration, copyright and patents, and its own constitution and procedure. Any island legislature is, in addition, competent to declare other matters to be within the competency of the general legislature. Any island enactment on such subjects is void if repugnant to an enactment of the general legislature, or may at any time be repealed or altered by one.

The Council meets at least once a year, at a place notified by proclamation (usually at St. John, Antigua), and no Council lasts more than three years. The session usually lasts from one to three weeks.

The expenses of the federal establishments are voted by the Council, and apportioned among the Presidencies.

The Council has power to alter its constitution by an ordinary Act, to be reserved for the King's pleasure, and the King has power, by Order in Council, at any time to include any other West Indian Island in the federation, upon joint addresses from the Legislative Body of such island, and from the Council, on such terms and conditions in each case as are in the addresses expressed. This power has not actually been exercised, and the inclusion in the Colony of Sombrero, which had no legislative body, was effected as above mentioned under a different Act.

Currency and Banking.

The usual currency is British silver, a few British and United States gold coins being occasionally met with. In addition to these, the gold doubloons are legal tender. The Colonial Bank has a branch in Antigua, one in St. Kitts, and one in Dominica. In the Virgin Islands, Montserrat and Nevis, there are no banks. The notes of the Colonial Bank circulate in Antigua (£3,500/.), and St. Kitts (£14,000/.), and those of the Danish Bank of St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands.

There is no limit to silver as a legal tender. Government savings banks have been established in all the Presidencies.

Means of Communication.

Mail communication exists with England and also with the other West Indian Islands (including Jamaica) and Demerara, once a fortnight, by the steamers of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. Also to the southern islands, and to the United States of America, once a fortnight, by the steamers of the Quebec and Gulf Ports Line,
and to Demerara, the other West Indian Islands (except Jamaica), Bermuda and the Dominion of Canada by Steamers of the Pickford and Black Line once a fortnight. Intermediate mails are also made up for the above places by the steamers of Messrs. Scrutton's Direct Line and others. The usual time occupied by the voyage from England to Antigua is about 14 days.

Two telegraph cables connect Dominica with St. Lucia (via Martinique) and Guadeloupe, and two cables connect St. Kitts with Antigua and St. Thomas. Antigua is also connected with Guadeloupe, and thence with the United States, Bermuda, Canada and Europe. The other islands are not in telegraphic communication by cable, the nearest cable stations to the Virgin Islands being St. Thomas and St. Croix, and the nearest to Montserrat, Barbuda, and Redonda being Antigua and St. Kitts. There are no railways or internal telegraphs.

Postage.

The rates for external postage are those of the Postal Union, but in the case of the U.K., India and certain Colonies,* letter postage was reduced to 1d. per ½ oz. from 25th Dec., 1898. Inland postal arrangements exist in Antigua, St. Kitts, Nevis and Dominica, the rates being 1d. for the first ½ oz., and ½d. for every additional ½ oz. within each of the islands.

Chief Towns.

The most important towns are St. John (Antigua), 9,047; Basseterre (St. Kitts), 9,962; and Roseau (Dominica), 5,764.

Defence.

There is no Imperial garrison.

There is now a Volunteer Defence Force in Antigua, St. Kitts and Nevis, consisting of infantry and mounted infantry, also Defence Reserve Corps in Antigua, Dominica, and Montserrat.

There are numerous old forts, mostly dismantled and in ruins, situated round the coasts of the several islands.

Education.

The system of elementary education is denominational, except in Dominica, the various denominations being Anglicans, Moravians, Wesleyans and Roman Catholics. With four exceptions, all the schools in Dominica are supported wholly from public funds. There are also two Government Schools in Antigua. The schools established by the denominations receive grants-in-aid, amounting, in 1905-6, to £4,158. The cost of the Government Schools in Antigua and Dominica was, for the same period, £2,189. School fees are charged only in Antigua and the Virgin Islands, and the schools are required to receive all children applying for admission. Grants-in-aid are refused to superfluous or inefficient schools. There are about 121 aided and Government Schools, attended by 25,904 children. Grants of varying amount are also made to grammar schools established in all the islands, except Montserrat and the Virgin Islands. Provision is also made for agricultural and technical instruction. The amount of Government Grant to secondary schools in the Colony is £1,048. for 245 scholars.

ANTIGUA.

Antigua is situated in W. long. 61° 45', and N. lat. 17° 6'. It is about 54 miles in circumference, and its area is 108 square miles, about half the size of Middlesex.

The islands of Barbuda (population 775) and Redonda (population 120) are dependencies of Antigua. They have a total area of 62½ square miles. Barbuda lies about 25 miles due north of the main island, with an area of 62 miles, is very flat, with a large lagoon on the west side, separated from the sea by a spit of sand. It was long owned by the Codrington family. It produces some salt and phosphates of lime, and is well adapted for cattle grazing and horse rearing. It is one of the few islands where wild deer are still found. Redonda, lying between Montserrat and Nevis, 25 miles S.W. of Antigua, in 26° 6' N. lat., 61° 35' W. long., 1 mile by ½ mile, 1,000 feet high, is valuable for its phosphate of alumina mines, discovered in 1866, now worked by the Redonda Phosphate Company under license and subject to an annual rental of 50l. On an average, 7,000 tons are annually exported to the United States, 90 men being employed.

Antigua was discovered by Columbus in 1493, who named it after a church in Seville, called Santa Maria La Antigua. It was first inhabited by a few English from St. Kitts in 1632. In 1663 Charles II. made a formal grant of the island to Lord Willoughby, who sent out a large number of colonists. After an interval of French occupation, it was declared a British possession by the Treaty of Breda, 1666. There are no rivers, and few springs in the island, and consequently it is exposed to frequent droughts. The island is in the main low-lying and has no forests. Rainfall:

Year. St. John's. Average of about 68 Stations.
1905 33°39' 31°40'

On the 22nd March, 1898, the Legislative Council, which was previously partly elected and partly nominated by the Governor, passed an Act abrogating itself and substituting the Crown Colony system. The new Council consists of sixteen members, eight official and eight non-official, all nominated by the Governor under Royal Letters Patent. The Governor presides.

The chief productions are sugar, cotton and pineapples, but much of the land has been allowed to become ruined in the hands of the old planting families. There are 73 estates in cultivation, comprising 15,989 acres. St. John, the chief town, has a population of 9,047, and is a port of registry, having on 31st December, 1903, 46 sailing vessels registered, with a total tonnage of 611. The other towns are Falmouth, Parham and English Harbour.

ST. CHRISTOPHER AND NEVIS.

This Presidency consists of the Islands of St. Christopher (St. Kitts), Nevis and Anguilla, with their several dependencies. These were united to form one Presidency by the Federal Act No. 2 of 1882.

The total population was 46,446 by the census of 1901, and the total area is about 150 square miles.

Constitution.

The title of the officer administering the Government was changed from that of President to that of Commissioner in 1888, when a Commissioner of the United Presidency of St. Christopher and Nevis was appointed. A further alteration in the constitution of the Government was made in 1895, when by Letters Patent and Royal Instructions dated 20th February, 1895, the office of Administrator was created, and that officer given fuller powers.

There is one Executive Council for the United Presidency, consisting of the Governor, the Administrator, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Auditor-General and such persons as His Majesty may from time to time appoint.

The Legislative body is styled the Legislative Council of St. Christopher and Nevis, and consists of six official and six nominated unofficial members, besides the Governor and the Administrator; the Governor, or, in his absence, the Administrator, or, in the absence of both of them, a member of the Council, appointed by the Administrator in writing, presides, and the President of the Council enjoys an original and also a casting vote. The Council meets in annual sessions at Basseterre, in St. Christopher, and is convened at such times as the Governor or Administrator sees fit.

Industry.

Tobacco was at first the principal crop grown, but it soon lost its pre-eminence, and the main industry of the two larger islands is now the production of sugar, molasses and rum, and the growth of Sea Island cotton. About 17,000 acres are in sugar-cane cultivation, and 4,000 in cotton. The crop exported from the Presidency during 1905 amounted to 12,345 tons of sugar, 3,084 puncheons of molasses, 282 puncheons of rum, and 263,778 lbs. of Sea Island cotton. Arrowroot, coffee, peanuts and vegetables are also grown in small quantities for local consumption. Successful experiments have been carried on in the growing of tobacco and cocoa, and the prospects are encouraging. Cattle, horses and small mules are raised. Salt is produced in St. Kitts and Anguilla.

Defence.

In 1896 a Volunteer Defence Force, consisting of mounted infantry and infantry, was raised. This force now numbers about 90 officers and men.

St. Kitts.

The island lies in latitude 17° 18' N., and longitude 62° 48' W. The area of the main body of it presents a long oval, from the south-eastern end of which runs a narrow neck, gradually expanding into a small knob of land, within which are the salt ponds.

The total length of the island is about 23 miles. The total area is 68 square miles.

The central part of the main body consists of a range of lofty rugged mountains, which traverses it from south-east to north-west, attaining its greatest height at Mount Misery, which is about 3,711 feet above the sea. On the south-west side of the island, between the mountains and the sea, but nearer the latter, is Brimstone Hill, formerly the seat of the garrison. It is quite isolated, and about 750 feet in height. This range of hills describes nearly a semicircle, forming the spacious and fertile valley or plain, on the seaboard of which lies Basseterre, the principal town, with a population of about 10,000.

The circle of land formed by the skirts and lower slopes of the mountain-range of the main body of the island, and the valley of Basseterre, constitute nearly the whole of the arable and cultivated portion of the island. The higher slopes of the mountains are covered with short grass, affording excellent pasturage, while their summits are crowned with dense wood.

The climate, for a tropical one, is decidedly healthy. The highest temperature in the shade is about 88°, the lowest 66°, and the mean average about 79°.

The rainfall for the year 1905 was 36'11 inches.

St. Kitts, the Carib name of which was Llanuiga, "The Fertile Isle," was the first settled of the British West Indies. Mr. Thomas Warner was despatched thither in 1623 by Mr. Ralph Merriefield, and commenced tobacco cultivation. His first crop, however, was destroyed by a hurricane, and the Colony was for some time in a precarious condition until the arrival of the ship Hopewell with supplies for the settlement.

In 1625, Warner, at the instance of the Earl of Carlisle, to whom Charles I. had granted Letters Patent over the islands of St. Christopher, Nevis, Antigua, Montserrat and Barbados, was appointed General-Governor of these Islands and Governor of St. Kitts.
Upon the same day in the year that Warner returned from a recruiting visit to England M. D'Esambuc, with a few Frenchmen, reached the island, and was permitted to form a settlement beside the English, a treaty of partition being afterwards made, the French obtaining the two ends of the island and the English the middle portion. From thence the greater number of the Lesser Antilles were colonised, thus earning for St. Kitts the name "Mother of the Antilles."

In October, 1628, a Spanish squadron devastated the island and ordered its abandonment, an order that had quite a contrary effect, and the two settlements rapidly increased. Warner was knighted in 1629.

War between the mother countries led to war between "the two nations" at St. Kitts, with the result that in April, 1666, the English were expelled from the island. Repelling an attempt at its recapture, the French remained in possession until the next year, when, by the Treaty of Breda, England recovered her share of it. Again, in 1689, the English suffered expulsion under cruel and barbarous circumstances, but a year later Sir Timothy Thornhill, after three weeks' fighting, recovered the island for the British arms, the whole of it remaining in England's possession for seven years, when, by the treaty of Ryswick in 1697, the French were restored to their former portions of it.

Once again did England become sole mistress when, in 1702, the French capitulated without resistance to General Hamilton, supported by a fleet of twenty ships. A French invasion four years later proved futile, and in 1712 the whole island was ceded to Great Britain by the Treaty of Utrecht.

For seventy years there was peace, and then, in 1792, after a memorable siege and two naval encounters, France enjoyed possession of the Fertile Isle. It was restored to England by the Treaty of Versailles on 23rd January, 1783, and two French raids in 1805 and 1806 mark the close of the remarkable history of this island's warfare.

Until the year 1866 St. Christopher had representative institutions of the type formerly so general in the West Indies. In 1866 (by Act No. 551), the two Houses were replaced by a single Legislative Assembly, partly nominated and partly elected. This Assembly abrogated itself, and substituted for itself a Legislative Council, consisting of five official and five unofficial members (Act of 28th June, 1878). The members were nominated by the Queen. The Governor, however, had power to nominate unofficial members provisionally. The Governor was President, or, in his absence, such member as he appointed in writing. Four besides the President were a quorum.

Nevis.

The island of Nevis is situated in 17° 40' N. lat., and 62° 33' W. long. It was discovered in 1498 by Columbus, and was colonised by the English from St. Kitts in 1628. Charlestown, the principal town, lies along the shore of a wide bay, and the mountain begins to rise immediately behind it. It has a population of about 1,500, and is a port of registry. The population of Nevis largely consists of peasant proprietors.

The island, which is divided into five parishes, is nearly of a circular form; its area is about 50 square miles, or about 32,000 acres, of which about 16,000 acres are fit for cultivation; its greatest elevation 3,596 feet above the sea.

The climate is very similar to that of St. Christopher, from which place it is separated by a strait of about two miles in breadth at its narrowest part, which, however, lies out of the direct course for boats plying between the two islands. The distance between Basseterre (St. Christopher) and Charlestown (Nevis) is about twelve miles, but the roughness of the sea occasionally prevents communication. In 1899 Nevis suffered much from the effects of a hurricane.

In 1866 (by Act 329) the constitution was simplified in the same manner as had then recently been adopted in St. Kitts and Antigua, and a single Chamber was established.

By an Act (No. 16 of 1877) to "Amend and simplify the Legislature of Nevis" the Assembly was abolished, and a Legislative Council established in its stead, and in 1882 the two islands were united into one Presidency.

Anguilla.

Anguilla is situated in 18° 12' N. lat., and 63° 5' W. long., about 60 miles N.W. of St. Christopher, and is sixteen miles in length, and varies in breadth from three to one and a half miles, containing an area of thirty-five square miles. The "Dogs" and neighbouring islands are dependencies of Anguilla.

The revenue of Anguilla may be estimated at about 500L. The local courts for the administration of justice are the Magistrate's Court and the Civil Jurisdiction Court. The island is also within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the Leeward Islands, of which the Resident Magistrate is Deputy Judge.

The island is healthy, but suffers from want of an adequate water supply. The population is computed at 3,890.

Besides cattle, ponies and small stock, the chief product is salt. The cultivation of Sea Island cotton has been extensively taken up.

DOMINICA.

Dominica is situated between 15° 10' and 15° 40' N. lat., and 61° 14' and 61° 30' W. long.; 29 miles long and 16 broad. It lies between the French Islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, being distant from each about thirty miles, and has an area of 291 square miles.

The island is very mountainous and picturesque. It was discovered by Christopher Columbus on Sunday (hence its name), the 3rd of November, 1493, in the course of his second voyage. It was included in the grant made of sundry islands in
the Caribbean Sea to the Earl of Carlisle, by a patent, dated 2nd June, 1627; but several attempts to bring the place under subjection to the English proved abortive. By the treaty signed at Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, it was stipulated between the English and French that Dominica and some other islands should remain neutral, and that the original proprietors, the Caribs, should be left in possession. During the time that Dominica was thus professedly regarded by the English and by the French as a "neutral" island, many French planters settled on it and established plantations.

Dominica was captured by the English in 1756, and by the ninth article of the peace of Paris, in 1763, was assigned to Great Britain. Commissioners were sent out for the purpose of surveying and selling lands capable of cultivation, which yielded to the British Crown the sum of £12,992. 1s. 1d. sterling. The French settlers were generally secured in their possessions, on condition of taking the oath of allegiance and paying a small quit rent. Dominica at this time formed one of a General Government, comprising also Grenada and the Grenadines, St. Vincent, and Tobago.

In 1771, the island was constituted a separate Government, under the administration of Sir Wm. Young, Bart. On the 21st June, 1775, the Royal Proclamation was issued, establishing a House of Representatives, fixing a new qualification for candidates and electors, and regulating proceedings at elections.

In 1778, the French, attracted by the fertility of the place, and invited over from Martinique by some of their countrymen, prepared a military and naval armament against the island, under the Marquis de Bouillé, Governor of Martinique, and became masters of the island on the 7th of September, after an obstinate resistance. Marquis Duchilleau, a cruel and tyrannical officer, was left as Governor. Trade failed, and great distress followed.

In 1783, the island was again restored to the English, and Sir John Ord, Bart., was appointed Governor.

In 1795, another invasion of the island was attempted by Victor Hugues, the French Republican chief, who had previously forced the British troops to evacuate Guadeloupe. The brave and well-directed resistance of the inhabitants, under the command of Governor Hamilton, forced part of the enemy to fly, and the rest to surrender.

In 1805, now the most remarkable epoch used in the island for marking the time of events, and which goes by the name of La Grange (the name of the invading General), the French again landed at each flank of Roseau. The regular troops and the militia fought gallantly, but unfortunately Roseau, the capital, was set on fire accidentally, and was obliged to capitulate, paying the enemy £12,000. to quit; whilst the Governor, Sir George Prévost, and the troops (regular and militia) proceeded across the island to the superior position of Prince Ruperts.

In 1833 the island was, with Antigua and the other Leeward Islands, formed into a General Government, under a Governor-in-Chief, resident at Antigua.

Serious riots occurred in 1893 in connection with the collection of taxes in the interior of the island. The police and a party of marines and blue jackets, landed from H.M.S. Mohawk, were stoned, and compelled to fire on the rioters, with fatal results. An inquiry into the administration was ordered by the Secretary of State, and entrusted to Sir R. Hamilton, formerly Governor of Tasmania, who visited the island, and made a report (vide H. L. 280, 1893, and C—7447, 1894).

Dominica, in common with other West Indian islands, was visited in 1897 by the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the condition of the West Indian colonies; and an important outcome of their recommendations was the grant, in 1898, of £15,000. by the Imperial Parliament for road construction in the Island. The Imperial Road, constructed out of this grant, has now been completed for a distance of 16 miles from Roseau to Bassinville, and a length of 4 miles of a proposed road connecting Bassinville with Layou has also been constructed.

It is estimated that about 130,000 acres in the island are at present uncultivated. Much of this was at one time under coffee, but "blight" and the marauding of the maroons led to the abandonment of many estates, while the depreciation of sugar has still further reduced the area of cultivation. The soil is rich and the climate healthy, and the island is well adapted to the cultivation of coffee, especially Arabian, and on the higher slopes in the centre of the island, where a commencement in this direction has recently been made, cocoa, tea, limes, nutmegs, spices, and tropical fruits of all kinds.

There are many thermal, chalybeate, sulphur, and other medicinal springs in the island, which is volcanic, and on the Grand Soufrière Hills there is a geyser or boiling lake at an elevation of 2,300 feet.

An eruption in the great crater took place on 4th January, 1880, ash and scoria covering the roofs of the houses in Roseau to a depth of two or three inches.

The island abounds in rivers stocked with fish, and there is a plentiful supply of water power.

Coffee, cocoas, lime-juice, and fruit are the chief products; sugar, formerly the staple industry, is now only exported in small quantities. A considerable trade is carried on also in spices, oils, and timber. The principal exports in 1905 were: Cocoa, 1,326,062 lbs.; sugar, 181 tons; limes and lime juice, value £36,953.; essential oils, £1,982.; fruit and vegetables, £1,424.

The rainfall in Roseau for 1905 was 72'06 inches; the average for the whole island was 118'93 inches; the mean temperature 79'9 Fahr.

The chief town is Roseau, population of 5,840 on 31st December, 1904; it is a port of registry, and had registered on 31st December, 1905, nine vessels, of a total tonnage of 80 tons. The other town is Portsmouth, to the north of the island, in Prince Rupert's Bay. There is a branch of the Colonial Bank at Roseau.

There is a Government telephone system of 300 miles, with 6 exchanges, and a Government electric light service for the town of Roseau.

The Local Government is administered by an Administrator, aided by an Executive Council of 6 members. In July, 1898, the Legislative Assembly, which was previously partly elected and partly nominated, passed an Act abrogating itself, and substituting the Crown Colony system. The new council consists of twelve members, six officials and six non-officials, all nominated by the Governor under Royal Letters Patent. The Administrator presides in the absence of the Governor from the Presidency.

Two-thirds of the inhabitants speak a French patois, but the acquisition and use of English is becoming more general.
LEEWARD ISLANDS: DOMINICA.

A remnant of the original Carib inhabitants of the Island is still in existence (vide Cd. 1228, 1902).

Montserrat.

This Island, discovered by Columbus in 1493, was named by him after a famous mountain in Spain, where is situated the monastery in which Ignatius Loyola conceived the project of founding the Society of Jesus.

It is situated 27 miles from Antigua in 16°45' N. lat., and 61° W. long., and is about 11 miles in length, and 7 in the broadest part. Its total area is 32½ square miles. It is of volcanic formation and very rugged and mountainous. The hills are covered with forest, the highest elevation being Soufrière Hill (3,000 feet) in the southern part of the island. Plymouth, the chief town, with a population of 1,461, is on an open roadstead on the south-west coast. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st December, 1905, 5 sailing vessels, total tonnage 110 tons net.

Montserrat was colonised by the English in 1632; the French took it in 1664, and levied heavy imposts on the inhabitants; it was restored to England in 1668. It capitulated to the French in 1782, but was restored to the English in 1784.

Montserrat possessed a Legislative Council and Assembly as early as 1668. After undergoing various modifications they became merged in a Legislative Assembly, which lasted down to 1867.

By an Act of the Legislative Assembly, dated 24th Dec., 1866, and confirmed by Order in Council 26th Feb., 1867, instead of a Legislative Assembly, a Legislative Council was established, having all the powers, authorities, and rights hitherto possessed by the Assembly. By Act No. 2, of 1902, which rescinded these Acts, His Majesty may, from time to time, appoint such persons, not exceeding four in all, as he may think fit, every Councillor holding office during His Majesty's pleasure.

The cultivation of sugar, once the staple industry of the island, has declined to such an extent that lime-juice may now be said to be the principal product, the exports in 1905 amounting to 95,352 gallons of raw, and 16,640 gallons of concentrated juice, of a total value of 6,474l. There are about 1,000 acres planted in lime trees, and the cultivation is being yearly extended. The industry is principally in the hands of the Montserrat Company, Limited. A trade in fresh limes, which are shipped to London, has also sprung up, and is likely to assume considerable proportions in the near future. About 1,000 cubic foot crates were exported in 1905.

The export of next importance is cotton, which was once grown during the American Civil War. The cultivation was re-introduced in 1901, and where the lands are suitable, has ousted the sugar industry, the exports in 1905 amounting to 82,322 lbs. of lint, valued at 4,046l., while the sugar shipped amounted to 237 tons only, of the value of 2,288l. The industry is capable of further expansion, suitable lands being still available.

The output of sugar declines annually. Whole estates which were once sugar plantations are now cultivated in cotton.

A small onion industry has been established, and a certain amount of pineapples are exported annually to the English markets. Among the other exports may be mentioned a drug known as "papain," and essential oils, which are exported to a limited extent.

The cultivation of coffee and cocoa has declined to such an extent that enough for home consumption is not now grown.
There are seven Anglican schools with 2,000 scholars, three Wesleyans with 907, one Roman Catholic with 307, and one undenominational with 335 scholars.

The roads of the island have of late years been much improved, macadamised, and drained by masonry culverts and surface drains; and every year progress is made in these respects, as far as the small revenue of the island will permit.

On 7th August, 1899, the island was devastated by a fearful hurricane.

The island is considered to be the most healthy of the Antilles.

The rainfall in 1905 was 49.89 inches (mean of 13 stations); and the mean temperature is about dry bulb 80°0', wet bulb 73°7'.

VIRGIN ISLANDS.

The Virgin Islands were discovered by Columbus in 1493; they consist of a cluster of islands to westward of and adjacent to Porto Rico; the largest in the group belonging to Great Britain is Tortola, which is situated in 18° 27' N. lat., and 64° 39' W. long. These islands, so far as they are British, became so in 1666.

The British islands (about 32 in number) include Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Anegada, Jost van Dykes, Peter Island, Salt Island, and all others not now actually in possession of Denmark, with the exception of Bieques, or Crab Island, and Culebra, which are now in the possession of the United States of America. The total area of the British colony is about 58 square miles. A lighthouse is maintained by the Board of Trade on Sombrero, which was first included in the Colony in 1904.

The Danes possess St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix.

A civil government and courts of justice were established in the Virgin Islands in 1773.

In April, 1867, an Ordinance was passed to amend the Constitution of the Virgin Islands. It was enacted that a Legislative Council should be constituted, to consist of the Colonial Secretary and the Colonial Treasurer, and not more than three unofficial members, to be nominated by the Administrator of the Government. This Ordinance was repealed May 1st, 1902, under which the Governor of the Leeward Islands ordains the laws. There is also an Executive Council.

The chief town is Road Town, Tortola, population 400, which is a port of registry, having, on 31st December, 1905, 26 vessels, total tonnage, 845.

A small quantity of sugar is made in the Virgin Islands, and during the American Civil War the landed proprietors planted cotton, which grows luxuriantly. The cultivation of Sea Island cotton was commenced in 1904, and a cotton ginnery has been erected by the Imperial Agricultural Department. The peasants own and cultivate most of the land in small plots for subsistence. They also raise a few cattle, and catch fish. They take their produce in small boats to St. Thomas, and this constant sailing among the reefs and currents which surround the Virgin Islands, makes them the finest seamen in the West Indies. They are a hardy, intelligent race, remarkably distinct from the inhabitants of the neighbouring islands. Their trade and intercourse is with the Danish Islands, and to a smaller extent with Hayti and San Domingo.

The currency consists almost entirely of foreign money, which circulates at the following rates of exchange, Danish money at 25 francs to 1l., American money at $5 to 1l.

On October 29th, 1867, the islands were visited by a fearful hurricane, which was most destructive to life and property.

The islands also suffered severely, but not to so great an extent, in the hurricane of August, 1871.

The climate is more healthy than that of the other West Indies, and the heat not so great. The average annual rainfall at Road Town is about 56 inches.

Large quantities of fibrous plants (agaves and bromelias) grow wild everywhere in Tortola.

The mail communication is by small sailing craft to St. Thomas. Mails are despatched to St. Thomas nearly every day, letters for Europe being usually sent via Havre about eight times a month.
