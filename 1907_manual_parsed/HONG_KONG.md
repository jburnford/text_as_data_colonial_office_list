HONG KONG.

Situation and Area.

Hong Kong is one of a number of Islands situated off the south-eastern coast of China, at the mouth of the Canton River, and lies about 40 miles east of Macao, 91 miles south of Canton, between 22° 9' and 22° 17' N. lat., and 114° 5' and 114° 13' E. long. The island is an irregular ridge, stretching nearly east and west; its broken and abrupt peaks rising to the height of nearly 2,000 feet above the sea level. Its length is about 11 miles, its breadth from 2 to 5 miles, its area rather more than 29 square miles (a third larger than Guernsey). It is separated from the mainland of China by a narrow strait, known as the Ly-ee-moon Pass, which does not exceed half a mile in width. The opposite peninsula of Kowloon (2½ square miles) was ceded to Great Britain by a Treaty entered into by Lord Elgin in 1861 with the Government of China, and now forms part of the Colony; which also includes Stonecutter's, Green, Apleechow, Middle, Round, and other islets.

In 1898 an agreement was concluded with the Chinese Government for the extension of Hong Kong territory by an area adjacent to British Kowloon, in the province of Kwong-tung, including Mirs Bay and Deep Bay, this area to be leased for 99 years; a stipulation was included that within the walled city of Kowloon (which lies outside of British Kowloon) the Chinese officials then stationed there should continue to exercise jurisdiction except so far as might be inconsistent with the military requirements for the defence of Hong Kong, but that within the remainder of the newly-leased territory Great Britain should have sole jurisdiction. In 1899 the Chinese officials ceased to exercise jurisdiction within Kowloon City, which thereafter, by Her late Majesty's Order in Council, was incorporated in the leased territory and became subject to British rule. The area of the mainland leased is about 370 square miles, and a careful survey of the territory was completed in 1904. This new territory has its headquarters at Tai Po on an arm of Mirs Bay. An Assistant Superintendent of Police, who is also a Magistrate with limited powers, and an Assistant Land Officer, reside there.

General Description.

The waterways of the Colony form one of the most magnificent harbours in the world, having an area of ten square miles. The granite hills which surround it rise between 2,000 and 3,000 feet high, the whole offering a coup d'œil which blends the wild scenery of Scotland with the classic beauty of Italy. The city of Victoria extends for four miles at the base of the hills which protect the south side of the harbour, and contains, with its suburbs, 377,850 inhabitants. Being built on the slope of the hills facing the sea, the general aspect of the town is perhaps more striking and picturesque from the water than that of any other city in the east, whilst many of the streets are shaded with well-grown and handsome trees. On the new Praya West Reclamation, completed in 1903, some new and handsome buildings stand, and others are in course of erection.

The rainfall for 1905 was 70·945 inches as compared with 80·41 inches in 1904, and 93·65 in 1903. The mean 1896–1905 was 74·94. The range of the thermometer in 1905 was from 87·8° in July to 51·6° in February. The rainy season extends from May to October; the wettest month in 1905 was June, with 19·70 inches. Typhoons are prevalent during the months of August and September. On the 18th of September, 1906, a disastrous typhoon occurred, causing enormous loss of life, especially amongst the Chinese boatmen, and involving great damage to shipping and buildings.

History.

The Colony, then a desolate island, sparsely inhabited by fishermen, was ceded to Great Britain in January, 1841; the cession was confirmed by the Treaty of Nankin, in August, 1842; and the charter bears date 5th April, 1843. The additions subsequently obtained on the mainland have been noted above.

Hong Kong did not become of much commercial importance until the discovery of gold in Australia, in 1851, and the consequent Chinese emigration. Its trade has gradually increased with the opening up of China to foreign trade.
Large local banking, dock, steamboat, and insurance companies were established between 1865 and 1872, and the trade was greatly increased by the opening of the Suez Canal.

The city is the depot for an incessant flow of Chinese emigration and immigration, the number in 1905 being 204,824 (principally to and from the Straits); emigrants, 64,341; immigrants, 140,483, excluding to and from China ports.

Industry.

The island produces little or nothing, but its position has made it a centre of trade in many kinds of goods. Amongst the principal are opium, sugar, flour, salt, earthenware, oil, amber, cotton, and cotton goods, sandal-wood, ivory, betel, vegetables, live stock, granite, &c., &c. The transactions of the tea and silk trade are largely controlled by Hong Kong firms. There are a few manufactories, which are rapidly increasing in number and importance, producing rope, sugar, rum, paper, vermilion, sauce, bricks, tiles and cement, bamboo work, and stores of every description for the supply of shipping. There is a considerable boat-building industry among the Chinese.

Shipping.

Hong Kong being a free port, it is not possible to give a correct return of imports and exports, but the enormous extent of the trade with which it is connected may be approximately estimated from the amount of shipping which has steadily grown, with one or two slight fluctuations, for over twenty years.

The total tonnage entering and clearing during the year 1905 amounted to 34,185,091 tons, being an increase, compared with 1904, of 622,305 tons, and the highest tonnage yet recorded.

There were 227,909 arrivals of 17,142,393 tons, and 224,849 departures of 17,042,698 tons.

Of British ocean-going tonnage 3,839,080 tons entered, and 3,833,274 tons cleared.

Of British river steamers 2,776,982 tons entered, and 2,777,040 tons cleared.

Of foreign ocean-going tonnage 2,917,550 tons entered, and 2,903,235 tons cleared.

Of foreign river steamers 329,743 tons entered, and 329,854 tons cleared.

Of steamships under 60 tons trading to ports outside the colony, 35,724 tons entered, and 35,724 tons cleared.

Of junks in foreign trade 1,428,966 tons entered, and 1,446,474 tons cleared.

Of steamships under 60 tons plying within the waters of the Colony 4,622,661 tons entered and 4,546,651 tons cleared.

Of junks in local trade 1,191,717 tons entered, and 1,170,446 tons cleared.

Thus:

| Per cent. |
|-----------|
| British ocean-going vessels represented | 22·4 |
| Foreign | 17·0 |
| British river steamers | 16·2 |
| Foreign | 2·0 |

| Junks in foreign trade represented | 8·5 |
| Steamships under 60 tons local trade represented | 26·7 |
| Junks in local trade | 7·0 |
| Total | 100·0 |

Docks.

Hong Kong is well provided with dock accommodation. There are five docks and three slips, which are well equipped with shears, engineer's and carpenter's shops, foundries, and every requirement for making repairs to large ships of war and merchant vessels. The Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock Company was aided by two loans from the British Government in 1864 and 1885, under the Colonial Docks Act. The dock accommodation is being largely increased in order to keep pace with the growing size of ocean steamers.
Currency and Banking.

The currency of Hong Kong consists of the following coins (vide Order in Council, 2nd Feb., 1895):

1. The silver dollar of Mexico.
2. British dollar.
3. The Hong Kong dollar, half dollar, and 20-cent, 10-cent, and 5-cent pieces, issued from the Hong Kong Mint (1866-68).
4. Half-dollars, 20-, 10-, and 5-cent pieces, imported from England, and coined at the Royal Mint and Birmingham Mint.
5. Copper coins representing one-hundredth part of the dollar (called one cent), and one-thousandth part of the dollar (mil or cash), imported from England.

There were issued from the Hong Kong Mint 2,108,054 dollars and 58,587 half-dollars; and 20-, 10-, and 5-cent pieces to the nominal value of $402,671. There have been obtained from England, and put into circulation up to 31st Dec., 1905, subsidiary coins (which now include half-dollars) to the nominal value of $43,604,205.

The coins issued from the Hong Kong Mint are never met with in the Colony now, and of the coins imported from England it is estimated that not more than 10 per cent. remain in the Colony.

A scheme was approved in 1903, for the payment of the higher and non-clerical officers in sterling, to be converted into dollars locally, according to a monthly average rate of exchange. Existing higher officers had the option of adopting the new scale, while those who preferred to retain their dollar salaries continue to draw exchange compensation, i.e., an allowance in dollars sufficient to make up the difference between the exchange value of the dollar and a dollar equal to 3s., with certain privileged rates for drawing leave salary and pension at home.

There are six principal banks, Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, National Bank of China, Limited, Mercantile Bank of India, Limited, International Banking Corporation, and the Yokohama Specie Bank, of which the first three have a note circulation of $16,194,305 on 31st July, 1906. There is no savings bank under Government control, but one conducted by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. The Comptoir National d'Escompte de Paris has an agency in the Colony.

Local weights and measures are the following:

1 tael = 1½ oz.; 1 picul = 133½ lbs. (avoirdupois); 1,000 Chinese cash = 1 dollar.

Means of Communication.

There is telegraphic communication with nearly the whole world by a cable to Shanghai (and thence to Japan and Russia) and three cables to Singapore, via (1) Saigon, (2) Saigon, Hué, Haiphong, Hainan, and (3) Labuan.

Hongkong possesses unrivalled steam communication. The P. & O. S. N. Co. and the M. M. Co. convey the European mail weekly, the Norddeutscher Lloyd Co. maintain a regular fortnightly mail service between Bremen and Hong Kong, the P. M. S. S. Co., O. & O. S. S. Co. and the Toyo Kisen Kaisha maintain a mail service with San Francisco, the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. a regular mail service with Vancouver, B.C., a regular line has been established by the Northern Pacific S. S. Co. to Tacoma, and Portland, Oregon, and the Portland and Asiatic S. N. Co. also run a line of steamers to Portland, the Great Northern Steamship Co. maintain a monthly service to Seattle with ships of over 20,000 tons gross register, the Eastern and Australian S. S. Co., the China Navigation Co. and the Norddeutscher Lloyd keep up a frequent but rather irregular service with the Australian Colonies, and Nippon Yusen Kaisha maintains service to Europe, India, Australia, and the United States (Seattle). In addition to these several great lines of merchant steamers run between ports in Great Britain and Hong Kong, of which the China Mutual S. S. Co., Ocean S. S. Co., and the Glen, Warrack, Mogul, Ben Union, and Shell lines are the most conspicuous. The Austrian Lloyd's steamers also ply from Trieste to Hong Kong, those of the Hamburg-Amerika line from Hamburg, and the Navigazione Generale Italiana Company's steamers run monthly from Genoa. Regular steam communication between Java and Hong Kong has been established by the Java-China-Japan Line. Between the ports on the east coast of China, Formosa and Hong Kong the steamers of the Douglas S. S. Co. ply regularly twice a week, and those of the Osaka Shosen Kaisha weekly, and there is constant steam communication with Hoihow, Manila, Saigon, Haiphong, Touane, Bangkok, Borneo, etc. With Shanghai, Tientsin, and the ports of Japan there is frequent communication by steamers of the Indo-China S. N. Co., China Navigation, and other lines, in addition to the English, French and German mail steamers, which leave weekly. Between Hong Kong, Macao, and Canton there is a daily steam service, and tri-weekly steamers as far as Wuchow on the West River.

A cable tramway connects the city with the higher levels, and another is contemplated. An electric tramway on the overhead trolley system from Shaukiwan to Kennedy Town, along the whole extent of the city, was completed and opened in July, 1904. No internal telegraph communication exists except for police and military purposes.* The island possesses few roads available for vehicular traffic except in the town of Victoria. A road has been constructed to complete the circuit of the island. The usual means of conveyance outside Victoria is by boat, chair, and ricksha. There are good roads in Kowloon, and a road from Kowloon ferry now runs to Tai Po Hú on an arm of Mirs Bay. The preliminary survey of a railway from Kowloon to the Chinese frontier, where it is to join a line from Canton, has been completed and the work of construction begun. The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters per ½ oz. |
|------------------|
| Hong Kong, Canton, and Macao | 2 cents |
| United Kingdom, India, Australia, Egypt, certain Colonies† and British Agencies in China | 4 " |
| Europe and America | 10 " |

In November, 1902, a Parcels Post Convention was signed between Hong Kong and the U.S.A., which came into force 1st January, 1904. The rate for parcels is 35 cents per lb. (limit of weight, 4lbs. 6ozs.). Direct parcel post services were started with the Netherlands Indies in 1904 and

*There are telegraph lines connected with the Gap Rock and Cape d'Aguilar Lighthouses, in connection with the signalling of ships, &c.

†See list at end of Introduction.
German New Guinea in 1906. Direct Money Order agreements were entered into with the Transvaal, Federated Malay States, Germany and German Colonies, Macao and Cape Colony. British Postal Orders are now payable in Hong Kong and at the British agencies. The postal agencies in China at Canton, Swatow, Amoy, Foochow, Ningpo, Hankow, Hoilow, Chefoo, Tientsin, and at Liu-Kung-Tau, Wei-hai-Wei, are under the superintendence of the Postmaster-General at Hong Kong. There is a branch office at Shanghai.

Education.

The number of Government schools and schools which receive grants from Government is 86, of which 25 are Upper Grade Schools with a staff competent to give instructions in all the subjects of Standard VII, and 61 are Lower Grade Schools under purely native management. This number includes two schools which are reserved for children of European British parentage. Broadly speaking the Upper Grade Schools are taught in English, and the Lower Grade Schools are taught in the Vernacular.

The total number of pupils in average attendance at Government and Grant Schools was 5,353 in 1905. Of these, 1,797 were in Government, and 3,556 in Grant Schools; 3,207 pupils received instruction in English, and 2,146 in the Vernacular. The proportion of boys to girls was 3,401 to 1,952.

Evening Continuation Classes have lately been instituted to supply instruction in commercial and technical subjects.

Revenue.

About one-third of the revenue is derived from the Opium Monopoly and one-fifth from municipal rates for police, lighting, water and other purposes; 13 per cent. on the annual value in Victoria and the Hill Districts; 12½ per cent. at Yau-ma-ti, Kowloon Point, and Hung-Hom; and rates varying from 7 per cent. to 9 per cent. in the outlying villages, payable by the owners. The annual rates payable on the valuation for 1906-7 are $1,395,934 '60, an increase of $64,038 '76 over those of previous valuation. The remainder is derived from licences, land revenue, stamps, and fees. Land Sales are expected to realize $200,000 in 1907, Stamp Revenue to reach $60,000, and Postal Revenue $418,200. The total Revenue is estimated at $6,448,000 for 1907.

Defence.

There is an Imperial garrison of about 4,000 men, towards the cost of which the Colony contributes 20 per cent. of the public revenue annually. There is a Volunteer Corps, consisting of two companies of Garrison Artillery and one company of Engineers and a Mounted Troop, with a membership of about 280. The Troop, which numbers about 30, has recently been formed for purposes of scouting and orderly duty in time of war. A Volunteer Reserve Association has also been formed, members of which are required to make themselves proficient in rifle shooting, and undertake to enrol under the Volunteer Ordinance in the event of hostilities. The association has a membership of about 220. The port is the headquarters of the China Squadron which combines with the East Indies and Australian Squadrons to form the Eastern Fleet. There is usually one war vessel present besides the Station Receiving Ship. Land batteries have been erected with a view to protecting the town and anchorage. There is an armed police, 1,018 strong in 1905, of whom 133 were Europeans, 382 Indians, and 503 Chinese.

Constitution.

The Government is administered under Letters Patent of 19th January, 1888, by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council, composed of six official and two unofficial members; besides the Governor. The Legislative Council is presided over by the Governor, and is composed of seven official and six unofficial members, three of whom are nominated by the Crown on the recommendation of the Governor (two being usually Chinese), one is nominated by the Justices of the Peace from their body, and one by the Chamber of Commerce. The unofficial members vacate their seats after six years from date of appointment. The "Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890," regulates the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in Admiralty cases. The English Common Law forms the basis of the legal system, modified by Colonial Ordinances, of which a revised edition to 1901 has been issued. The law as to civil procedure was codified by Ordinance No. 3 of 1901.
