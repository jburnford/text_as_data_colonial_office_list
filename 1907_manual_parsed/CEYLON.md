The Maldive Archipelago, 400 miles west of Ceylon, made up of 17 groups of islets, which is sparsely inhabited by a mixed race of probably Aryan original stock, speaking a dialect akin to Elu, or old Sinhalese, is tributary to Ceylon, to which the Sultan sends an embassy annually. The inhabitants of the Archipelago have for at least six centuries professed the Mohammedan religion. The islands are covered with coco-nut palms and yield millet, fruit, and coco-nut produce. Communication is mainly by native craft with India and Ceylon. The population is roughly estimated at about 30,000, the people being well governed, and energetic traders and seamen. Mali, the largest island, is 7 miles in circumference.

The Laccadive Islands are under the administration of the Government of India.

Climate.

The climate for a tropical country is comparatively healthy; the heat in the plains, which is nearly the same throughout the year, being much less oppressive than in Hindustán. Along the coast the annual mean temperature is about 80° Fahr.; at Kandy, 1,665 feet above sea level, it is 76° (average of ten years); at Colombo the annual variation is from 76° to 86°; at Galle 70° to 90°, and at Trincomalee 74° to 91°. In the mountain ranges there is of course a great variety of climate, the thermometer at the hill station, Nuwara Eliya, which is some 6,000 feet above the level of the sea, falling at night as low as 32°. The annual mean rainfall is about 87-88 inches, the rainy season extending from April to June and from September to November, but there is hardly a month without some rain, and the result is the luxuriant vegetation for which the island is famous.

History.

The authentic history of the island begins at the fifth century B.C., when an Aryan invasion from the Valley of the Ganges established the Sinhalese dynasty. Buddhism was introduced in the third century B.C., and from that time this faith has been preserved in comparative purity, exempt from the Hindu persecutions which drove it from India. The island abounds in interesting relics of antiquity, and in rock inscriptions, which, with the written annals left by the Sinhalese kings, are of peculiar value in revising Indian chronology.

Ceylon was visited in early days by the Greeks, Romans, and Venetians; in 1505 the Portuguese formed settlements on the west and south of the island; in the next century they were dispossessed by the Dutch. In 1795-6 the British took possession of the Dutch settlements in the island, which were then annexed to the Presidency of Madras, but five years later, in 1801, Ceylon was constituted a separate Colony. In 1815 war was declared against the native Government of the interior; the last Kandyan King was taken prisoner, and the whole island fell under the rule of the British.

Constitution.

By Letters Patent under the Great Seal, April, 1831, a Council of Government was appointed, and by a supplementary commission to the then Governor (March, 1833) the form of Government almost as now existing was established.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council of five members, viz., the Lieutenant-Governor and Colonial Secre-
tary, the Officer Commanding the Troops, the Attorney-General, the Auditor-General, and the Treasurer; and a Legislative Council of 17 members, including the members of the Executive Council, four other office-holders, and eight nominated unofficial members.

For purposes of general administration, the Island is divided into nine Provinces, presided over by Government Agents, who with their assistants and subordinate Headmen are the channel of communication between the Government and the people.

**Defence.**

Imperial troops are stationed at Colombo and Kandy, and an annual contribution is paid to the Imperial Government for the cost of the garrison. The Colonial contribution for 1905 was Rs.2,439,784. It is fixed by ordinance at 9½ per cent. of the general revenue (less land sales and railway charges), but is never to exceed three-fourths of the cost of the garrison. Colombo harbour has been strongly fortified at the joint expense of the Colonial and Imperial Governments.

The volunteer force of the Colony at the end of December, 1905, consisted of 2,479 of all ranks.

**Population, Area, and Statistics.**

According to the decennial census, taken on the 1st March, 1901, the population is 3,578,333, an increase of 18¾ per cent. on the population enumerated in 1891. The details of the population are as follows (including the military, shipping, estates, and 4,914 prisoners of war):

| Province                  | Population |
|---------------------------|------------|
| Western Province          | 925,342    |
| Central ditto             | 623,011    |
| Northern ditto            | 341,985    |
| Southern ditto            | 566,925    |
| Eastern ditto             | 174,288    |
| North-Western Province    | 353,845    |
| North-Central ditto       | 79,110     |
| Province of Uva           | 192,072    |
| Province of Sabaragamuwa  | 321,755    |
| **Total**                 | **3,578,333** |

Among these are 9,509 Europeans, 23,539 Burghers and Eurasians, 2,331,045 Sinhalese, 953,535 Tamils, 228,706 Moors, 11,963 Malays, and 20,036 persons of other nationalities. The Buddhists (2,141,596) number more than half the population, there are 828,480 Hindús, 357,772 Christians (mostly Catholic), 248,067 Mohammedans, and 2,418 other religionists. The population of the principal towns was as follows:

- Colombo, 158,228; Negombo, 19,946; Moratuwa, 29,600; Kalutara, 11,500; Kandy, 26,519; Jaffna, 33,879; Galle, 37,316; Matare, 11,848; Batticaloa, 10,037; Trincomalee, 11,913; Kurunegala, 6,483; Badulla, 5,924.

The number of Indian coolies on the tea estates, &c., is about 400,000. They are under no indentures, and are free to quit on giving a month's notice. The total number of plantation labourers, including coolies born and settled in Ceylon, as well as of other races, is estimated at 440,000.

About one quarter of the area of the Colony, after deducting backwaters, &c., is under cultivation. Some 4,900 square miles in the centre form the mountain zone with an altitude of from 1,500 to 8,000 feet above the sea level.

The most important products are:

| Product               | Acres   |
|-----------------------|---------|
| Cocoanuts             | 820,000 |
| Rice                  | 610,000 |
| Tea                   | 380,000 |
| Grain (other than Rice)| 120,000 |
| Rubber                | 104,000 |
| Cinnamon              | 64,000  |
| Cocoa                 | 33,000  |
| Tobacco               | 25,000  |
| Coffee                | 4,000   |
| Cinchona              | 500     |

There are about 1,700 plumbago mines and pits in the island, which gave an aggregate yield of roughly 613,000 cwts. of mineral in 1905, the value of which may be estimated at over Rs.7,000,000. There are about 400 gem quarries.

The pearl banks near Manaar have been leased to an English Company for a term of twenty years from January 1st, 1906, at a rental of Rs.310,000 per annum, it being stipulated that a sum of between Rs.50,000 and Rs.150,000, at the discretion of the Government, shall be expended annually by the Company upon the improvement of the banks on scientific lines.

The minimum upset price of Crown land is Rs.15 per acre. 35,500 acres were sold in 1905 at an average price of Rs.36 per acre. A large demand has recently arisen for land suitable for rubber cultivation.

The revenue is principally derived from Customs Duties, Land Sales, Licences (under which head is entered the amount realised by the sale of Arrack Rents), Salt (which is a Government monopoly), Stamps, and Railway Receipts. The revenue from the sale of salt in 1905 was Rs.1,406,602. This is local salt worked by the Government, but the importation of foreign salt is allowed.

The local revenues raised by the Municipalities of Colombo, Kandy, and Galle, by the Provincial Road Committees, and by the Local Boards of Health and Improvement which have been established in the towns of Kalutara, Negombo, Minuwangoda, Gampola, Nuwara Eliya, Matale, Nawalapitiya, Hatton Dickoya, Matare, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Chilaw, Anuradhapura, Badulla, Ratnapura, and Kegalla, amounted in 1905 to Rs.2,158,179.

The municipal debt on 31st December, 1905, was Rs.380,381 rupees. Of this amount 164,706 rupees is the balance unpaid out of a loan of 250,000 rupees for the construction of waterworks at Kandy, and 55,763 rupees balance of a loan obtained by the municipality of Galle in 1890 for the construction of waterworks.

The development of the tea industry is shown by the following statistics:—Export, 1884, 2,392,963 lbs.; 1886, 7,849,888 lbs.; 1888, 23,820,471 lbs.; 1890, 45,799,518 lbs.; 1892, 72,282,525 lbs.; 1893, 82,269,353 lbs.; 1894, 85,376,322 lbs.; 1895, 98,581,060 lbs.; 1896, 110,095,193 lbs.; 1897, 114,466,318 lbs.; 1898, 122,395,617 lbs.; 1899, 129,661,908 lbs.; 1900, 149,264,602 lbs. of tea were exported in 1900, 144,275,608 lbs. in 1901; 150,829,707 lbs. in 1902; 149,227,236 in 1903; 157,929,333 lbs. in 1904; and 170,183,558 lbs. in 1905.

There has been a remarkable development in rubber cultivation in recent years. Rubber was first brought to Ceylon in 1876, and its growth proved successful. On the failure of coffee planters preferred to substitute tea, which was
found to thrive so well, and which gave a return three years after planting, whereas in the case of rubber six or seven years were required. On the price of tea falling, however, planters turned their attention to rubber, the demand for which had increased owing to trade requirements, and while in 1898 750 acres were estimated to be planted with rubber, in 1901 there were 2,500 acres, in 1904, 11,000 acres, in 1905, 40,000 acres, and in October, 1906, 104,000 acres under this product.

The value of the products of the cocoonut palm exported in 1905 was rs. 22,448,000; of cinnamon exported, rs. 2,312,000; and of cocoa exported, rs. 2,435,500. Of the total Ceylon produce exported that portion going to the United Kingdom was valued at rs. 53,827,187, that to British possessions valued at rs. 18,025,305, and that to foreign countries at rs. 29,046,059.

The chief imports are rice from India, valued at rs. 37,234,500 in 1905, and textiles and coal from the United Kingdom.

Law and Justice.

The basis of the law is the Roman-Dutch law, much modified by the introduction of English law and by Colonial ordinances. The criminal law has been codified on the model of the Indian Penal Code, and the codification of the law of Criminal and Civil procedure respectively have been completed.

Justice is administered by the Supreme Court which has an original criminal jurisdiction and decides appeals from the inferior Courts both in civil and criminal cases; the Police Courts and Courts of Requests, which dispose, respectively, of trivial criminal and civil suits; and the District Courts, which have a criminal jurisdiction intermediate between that of the Supreme Court and the Police Courts, and a civil jurisdiction in all cases whatsoever. In addition to these there are the Ganabawas, or Village Councils, instituted under the Ordinance No. 24 of 1889, with powers to deal with petty offences and trifling claims. They have worked admirably, being thoroughly adapted to the genius of the people, and, besides settling a considerable amount of litigation, have provided a valuable machinery for carrying out local improvements. They are empowered to make rules, subject to the approval of the Governor and the Executive Council, relating to their village economy, and it is noticeable that in many instances they have not only voluntarily provided school buildings and undertaken the cost of the current expenses and repairs, but have made elementary education compulsory.

Education.

Satisfactory progress is being made in education. The number of scholars in Government schools at the end of 1905 was 70,715, in schools aided by Government 156,040, and in unaided schools 36,478.

The total expenditure on account of the Educational Department was rs. 1,099,057-61. In 1868, the number of scholars was only 6,897, and the expenditure 161,660 rupees. The improvement is due to the institution of a Department of Public Instruction, and the adoption of the system of payments for results. The Government schools are all unsectarian, and no fee is charged for vernacular education; small fees are charged for English teaching.

The higher education of the Colony has since 1st January, 1885, been mainly left to local effort, as, owing to retrenchment, the Department has been compelled to devote its funds mainly to the extension and development of primary education. The only High School entirely supported by Government is now the Royal College, but there are numerous and excellent Grant-in-Aid High Schools. Two Government scholarships each of 200l. per annum for 3 years, to be spent at English Universities, are awarded annually.

Technical education is provided at the Grant-in-Aid Industrial Schools and Orphanages, of which there are 37. A central Technical College was founded in Colombo in 1893.

A Government Training College for Masters in English Schools and Government Anglo-Vernacular Schools were opened in 1903.

There is a Medical College, with a full staff of professors. The lectures are recognised by the examining bodies in Great Britain. There are two departments in the College, the Medical and the Apothecary. The former consists of students whose course of study extends over five years. A licence to practise medicine, surgery and midwifery is granted to each member of the Medical department who passes the prescribed examinations in the College. This licence is recognised by the General Medical Council of Great Britain as a registrable qualification. The members of the Apothecary department, after a training of two years, and after passing the prescribed examination, are qualified to serve as apothecaries. Female students were admitted from 1st May, 1892. There were 141 students attending during the year 1906, of whom 108 belonged to the Medical and 33 to the Apothecary department.

The Government maintains 65 hospitals, exclusive of 22 infectious hospitals, 19 jail hospitals, and two asylums, one for lunatics of 476 beds, and the other for lepers of 332 beds. There are special institutions for diseases of women, and for the eye, ear and throat. There is a Bacteriological Institute. There are 362 dispensaries, 65 of which are attached to hospitals, the remaining 297 are institutions independent of hospitals. In addition there are 142 private estate dispensaries which receive free drugs from the Government.

The Ceylon Civil Medical Department consists of one Principal Civil Medical Officer and Inspector-General of Hospitals who is also Principal of the Medical College, one Assistant Principal Civil Medical Officer and Inspector-General of Hospitals, one Registrar of College, one Director De Soyza Bacteriological Institute, one Public Analyst and Professor of Chemistry, 78 officers having British qualifications, 2 with Calcutta degrees, 3 with Madras degrees, 3 medical women with British qualifications, 48 with licences to practise granted by the Ceylon Medical College, 242 apothecaries, 8 inspectors of vaccination, and 108 vaccinators, including 4 females. There are two institutions where nurses are trained, and the nursing staff consists of 11 European qualified nurses, 27 European Roman Catholic sisters (untrained), 28 matrons and 27 nurses trained locally, and 16 pupils in training.

The cost of working the department amounted in 1905 to rs. 1,804,117-65. The expenditure on account of estate medical aid was rs. 576,043-53. The receipts, which included cost of maintenance of paying patients, sale of medicines, voluntary collections at dispensaries and medical college fees, etc., amounted to rs. 261,367-47. The export duty levied for the partial upkeep of the Estates Branch of the Department yielded rs. 159,488-68.
Currency and Banking.

The weights and measures in common use are British.

Accounts are kept in rupees, and the money in circulation is Indian and Ceylon rupee currency and sovereigns, gold having been made a legal tender at the fixed rate of rs. 15 per sovereign in 1901. Ceylon cents take the place of the Indian annas and pice. The notes of the Chartered Mercantile Bank remained in circulation to some extent until 1888, when its charter expired, but since the failure of the Oriental Banking Corporation in 1884, the Government has instituted a note-issue of which the amount in circulation on the 31st August, 1904, was rs. 12,651,095. These notes are legal tender except at the Colombo Issue Office.

The salaries of the higher public officers were revised in 1905. Those appointed from England subsequent to January 1st, 1905, receive a sterling salary payable in Ceylon at the current rate of exchange. Those appointed prior to that date were given the option of either (A) accepting the sterling salaries assigned to their appointments, which were fixed at a sum higher than the rupee salaries formerly attached to them, and forfeiting (a) the privileged rates of exchange for leave pay and pension drawn in the United Kingdom, viz.: 1s. 10½d. per rupee in the case of officers appointed before 19th February, 1897, and 1s. 6d. in the case of officers appointed between that date and 1st January, 1905; and (b) the exchange compensation granted when the salaries were fixed in rupees, i.e., the allowance in rupees in respect of half the salary drawn in Ceylon, sufficient to make up the difference between the market value of the rupee (1s. 4½d.) and 1s. 6d.; or (B) of continuing on the rupee salary previously assigned, enhanced by double exchange compensation, the whole being a pensionable emolument, and the privilege rate of exchange being retained for leave and pension purposes.

The following banks have establishments in the Colony: Mercantile Bank of India, Limited; Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China; Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation; Bank of Madras; National Bank of India, Limited. None of these now issue notes in Ceylon.

The Ceylon Savings Bank was established in 1832, and Post Office savings banks were opened in 1885, and the two together had on 31st December, 1905, rs. 5,987,932 deposited.

Public Works.

The Colombo Harbour.

The Harbour Works consist of three breakwaters. The South-West, commenced in 1873, and completed in 1885, at a cost of 705,207l., is 4,212 feet long, and runs from the shore in a direction North by East. It is built of concrete blocks weighing from 18 to 30 tons, set in what is known as the sloping bond system.

The North-East and North-West breakwaters were commenced in 1894, and completed in 1906, at a total cost of 500,000l. The North-East breakwater is a rubble embankment 1,100 feet long, tipped from a staging.

The North-West breakwater is an island work, 2,657 feet in length, running between the two shore breakwaters, leaving a southern entrance of 800 feet, and a northern entrance of 700 feet. This breakwater is of similar construction to the South-West arm.

These three breakwaters enclose an area of 640 acres, or one square mile, with a depth of from 30 to 36 feet at low water.

The Graving Dock. In addition to the above-named works a Graving Dock was commenced in 1899, and will be completed in 1907. It is 700 feet long, 85 feet wide at the entrance, and has a depth over the sill of 30 feet at low water. Its cost will be about 400,000l.

The Patent Slip was commenced in 1899, and opened on the 1st January, 1903, at a cost of 43,000l. It is 800 feet long, the cradle being 220 feet, and is capable of dealing with vessels up to 1,200 tons dead weight.

The Coalting Depot consists of 24 acres of land, reclaimed from the sea, with a frontage of 2,200 feet, from which 18 jetties project into the harbour for the landing, stacking and shipping of coal.

The total cost of the Reclamation and Jetties will amount to about 163,000l.

The Fishery Harbour has been constructed to the northward of Colombo harbour for the use of the fishermen as a beaching ground, the whole of the foreshore inside Colombo harbour having been covered up by reclamation work. The fishery harbour consists of a rubble breakwater running out from the shore in a curve for 800 feet, the sheltered part forming a natural beaching ground for fishing canoes. The cost will be approximately 35,000l.

The whole of the above works will be completed early in 1907. The total expenditure on the harbour from 1873 to the 30th June, 1906, amounted to rs. 35,794,450 or 2,386,296l., taking the value of the rupee at 1s. 4d.

Works have been constructed for the storage and supply of water to Colombo. The water is stored in a reservoir at Labugama, 25 miles distant from Colombo, and conveyed by piping to the service reservoirs at Maligakanda and Elie House, whence it is distributed through the town. The total cost of the scheme was rs. 4,330,000 exclusive of the cost of Elie House reservoir. A duplication of the main and reservoir at Elie House have been completed at a cost of about rs. 1,863,200.

In the matter of communication, great efforts have been made to keep pace with the growing requirements of the Colony. The telephone has been introduced in Colombo, and the principal towns are connected by the telegraph, which is connected with the Indian telegraph system—1,611 miles of line, comprising 3,197 miles of wire, are open in Ceylon.

The lines of railway, all of which are owned and worked by the Government, are distributed thus:—Broad Gauge (5ft. 6in.), Colombo to Bandarawela (160½ miles), Polgahawela to Kankesanturai (211½ miles), Peradeniya Junction to Kandy and Matale (21 miles), Ragama Junction to Mahara Quarry (13 miles), Colombo to Matara (98½ miles), Fort Junction to Wharf (12 miles). Narrow Gauge (2ft. 6in.), Colombo to Yatiantota (47½ miles) Nannuoya to Ragalla (19½ miles). Total mileage 561½ miles. The total cost of construction up to 31st December, 1905, charged in account was rs. 76,536,062. The receipts during 1905 were rs. 9,690,653, and expenditure rs. 5,206,899.

Of metalled and track metalled roads there are 2,712·51 miles; gravelled and natural roads, 683·98 and 366·23 miles respectively; of canals 153·02 miles. The maintenance of 3,762·72 miles of road cost, in 1905, rs. 1,766,589, or an average rate of rs. 469 per mile. This is exclusive of roads within municipal limits, and of minor roads which are not in the charge of the Department of Public Works. Every male between the ages of 18 and 55 is bound to perform six days' labour in the year on the roads, or to contribute a rupee and a-half (two
rupees in the town of Colombo) by way of commutation. The Road Committees collect the commutation, but the amount derived from this source is inconsiderable as compared with the outlay. Substantial progress has been made in recent years in the restoration of the ancient irrigation tanks, and the construction of new waterworks.

Means of Communication.

1. A fortnightly mail service by P. and O. steamers between the United Kingdom, India, Ceylon, Straits and China, and Australia. 2. A fortnightly service between Marseilles, Ceylon, Straits and China, and India, by the steamers of the Messageries Maritimes. A monthly service between Ceylon and Australia. 3. A fortnightly service between the United Kingdom and Australia, calling at Colombo, Ceylon, by steamers of the Orient Navigation Company. 4. A fortnightly service by the steamers of the Nordeutscher Lloyd Steam Navigation Company between Europe and China and Ceylon. A monthly service between Ceylon and Australia and China by these steamers. The passage to Brindisi or Marseilles generally occupies from 14 to 16 days, and to Bombay, Madras, Calcutta, Penang, Singapore, and China 4, 2, 6, 5, 5, and 14 days respectively. There is also a monthly mail service between Ceylon and Mauritius, which is carried on by the steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company.

Letters, etc., from England reach Colombo in about 16 days (14 minimum, 17½ maximum).

Further facilities are afforded for communication by the British India Steam Navigation Company, the Austro-Hungarian Lloyd's, the Clan Line, the City Line, Anchor Line, Compania Transatlantica, Holt's, &c. The steamers of the first leave Colombo weekly for Bombay and Calcutta, calling at intermediate ports in India, and their fortnightly service between Calcutta and London calls at Colombo.
