QUEENSLAND.

Situation and Area.

Queensland occupies the whole of the northern portion of Australia, commencing at a point on the east coast called Point Danger, in lat. 8° south, about 400 miles north of Sydney, the capital of New South Wales.

The greater portion of the southern boundary is formed by the 29th parallel of south latitude. The eastern seaboard extends about 1,500 miles, from Point Danger to Cape York, the extreme northern point of the continent, in lat. 10° 40'.

Thursday Island, in Torres Straits, with Moreton, Stradbroke, Fraser, Hinchinbrook, Prince of Wales, Wellesley, and many other islands, are included in the State.

The breadth of the territory near the southern boundary is about 900 miles from the eastern coast to the meridian of 138° east longitude, which forms the western boundary line of the State, separating it from the territory of South Australia. This includes the greater part of the Gulf of Carpentaria, which has a seaboard of about 750 miles. The whole of the State of Queensland comprises 668,497 square miles, or 427,838,080 acres (being equal to three times the German Empire and Belgium together).

History.

Captain Cook landed in Moreton Bay in 1770, but the Brisbane River, running into Moreton Bay, was not discovered until 1823, and the Moreton Bay Settlement was formed from New South Wales in 1824. The Darling Downs were explored in 1828, and squatters began to settle on the rich pasture grounds. The territory was, however, not thrown open to colonisation until 1842, and, after explorations by Leichhardt, 1845-7, and by Kennedy in York Peninsula in 1847, it was separated from New South Wales on 10th December, 1859, when it became a separate colony, under the name of Queensland, with about 25,000 inhabitants, having responsible government from the first.

Climate and Physical Features.

The climate is comparable to that of Madeira, the mean temperature being high but constant. The northern part is tropical. The mean temperature at Brisbane is about 69°, the extreme range being from 35° to 106°, the latter, however, very rarely occurring. The rainfall in the interior is scanty and variable; the mean at Brisbane is about 35 inches, mostly from November to May.

The country extending along the eastern seaboard is indented with several fine bays and estuaries, which are the outlets of rivers, a number of which are navigable for good-sized vessels.

A mountain range, called the "Main," or "Great Dividing Range," extends throughout the greater portion of the Colony; it is a continuation of the main range, or Cordillera of New South Wales and Victoria, and runs northerly throughout its course, and traverses the northern peninsula to its termination at Cape York, the most northerly point of the continent of Australia. At or near the 21st parallel of south latitude another range leaves the Great Divide nearly at right angles, and traversing the State westerly, separates the waters flowing east, south and west from those which, flowing northerly, debouch into the Gulf of Carpentaria. Between this range and the eastern shore are situated the highest mountains in the country, viz., the Bellenden Kerr Range, which reach an elevation of over 5,000 feet above the sea level.

Products and Industries.

Between the main range and the sea, especially on the banks of the rivers, there are large quantities of good alluvial land, which in its natural state is covered with a dense growth of timber. Much of this, in the more settled portions of the country, has been cleared and cultivated, and is found to yield a remunerative return to the farmers, who are usually small proprietors, cultivating the soil principally with their own labour, and growing chiefly sugar, maize, English and sweet potatoes, arrowroot, and semi-tropical fruits.

The year 1902 witnessed the culmination of an unprecedented period of drought, to which must be attributed the reduced output of many primary products about that period.

Sugar growing has become a very important industry. In 1905 there were 134,107 acres under cane, of which 96,093 acres were crushed, yielding a return of 1,415,745 tons of cane, which produced 152,722 tons of sugar at 94% net titre.

Maize was grown on 113,720 acres, and returned a yield of 2,164,674 bushels.

Tobacco Cultivation.—During the year ended 31st Dec., 1905, 933 acres yielded 10,230 cwts. of cured leaf.

In 1905 the quantity of land under arrowroot was 393 acres, which yielded 4,446 tons of tuber, and 758,520 lbs. of manufactured arrowroot were made from a portion of this at the factories. A considerable portion of this root is utilised for pig food.

Much of the country to the west of the dividing range of mountains is elevated tableland, consisting of wide plains, almost devoid of timber, but well grassed and watered, embracing many millions of acres of excellent agricultural soil. Within a certain distance of the mountains where the rainfall is tolerably regular, much of the land is well adapted for the production of wheat. This is cultivated in the neighbourhood of Toowoomba and Warwick on the Darling Downs; also at Roma and Mitchell further to the west. In 1905, out of the total area planted with this cereal, 2,856 acres were mown for hay, and 119,336 acres yielded 1,137,321 bushels of grain, 15,287 acres were cut for green forage.
Grazing is far in advance of tillage farming in the State, and there are 1,113 squatting "runs" or tracts of land, containing 179,722,320 acres, leased from the Government at a very low annual rental, more than half the number of which are surveyed, besides which an additional area of 22,997,960 acres are leased as grazing farms and homesteads.

The chief exports were: Wool, valued at 2,649,751l.; gold, 2,638,044l.; sugar, 1,448,885l.; live stock, 1,132,107l.; tin, 299,878l.; silver, 32,269l.; meat 828,525l.; meat extract, 145,159l.; hides and skins, 430,430l.; tallow, 202,298l.; green fruit, 185,329l.; copper, 447,530l.; butter, 455,863l.

The imports are textiles, alcohol, tea, flour, hardware and machinery. Nearly all of the external trade is with the United Kingdom and the other Australasian States and Colonies; what little is done elsewhere is principally with Hong Kong, Germany, India, China, and the United States.

The mining industry is one of the most important in the State, and gives employment to over 25,000 men. The leading gold mines are situated at Charters Towers—the Rockhampton district, which includes the famous Mt. Morgan mine, Gympie, Croydon, and Etheridge; but groups of other gold mines, some of considerable value, are being worked in over twenty-eight districts apart from those above-mentioned. The total production of gold during 1905 amounted to 592,620 fine ozs. The Herberton district is the head-quarters of the silver, (69,176l.), tin, and copper mining industries, but the districts of Cooktown, Ravenswood, Stanthorpe, Hodgkinson, and Mount Perry also contribute largely to the output of the baser metals, amongst which also should be mentioned bismuth, wolfram (99,873l.), and lead. Copper to the value of 503,547l., and tin 297,454l., were raised during the year. Excellent opals are also obtained from the western and extreme south-western portions of the State, the output for 1905 being of the value of 3,000l., whilst precious stones, comprising chiefly sapphires and other corundums, were found over an extended area. At Anakie, on the Central Railway, gems to the value of 5,255l. were obtained last year. Excellent coal continues to be raised in the environs of Ipswich, the Burrun and Peak Downs, whilst valuable deposits of this mineral are about to be worked at Callide, as well as in other portions of the central districts; but besides these pits numerous workable seams of this mineral are known, and their being actively worked depends solely on the opening of an extended market. The total output for 1905 was 529,326 tons, valued at 155,477l.

Useful timbers of various descriptions grow in abundance in Queensland, and ought to become a valuable export. The timber indigenous to the Colony is popularly divided into two classes, termed respectively "hard" and "soft" woods. The undermentioned trees supply the hard wood, which is most in demand: blue gum, flooded gum, iron bark, blackbut, turpentine, stringy bark, spotted gum, bloodwood, beech, yellow wood, dark yellow wood, &c., &c. Some of these woods are especially valuable for railway making, bridge, pier, and wharf building, as well as for fencing purposes, on account of their strength and durability. The timbers which are used for house and boat building, cabinet and ornamental work, have a fine grain, are easily worked, and take a bright polish; a few of those most in use are as follows:

red cedar, Moreton Bay Bean tree pine, Kauri pine, cypress pine, she pine, silky oak, satin wood, &c., &c.

Amongst the medicinal plants supplying extracts and preparations which are attracting notice in both Europe and America, may be mentioned—Duboisia myoporoides, the extract of which is in demand as a substitute for belladonna; Alstonia constricta, whose bark is a valuable tonic; Euphorbia Drummondii, the extract of which is effective in dysentery and low fever; Euphorbia pilulifera, or the asthma herb; and the lemon-leaved iron bark which, on distillation, yields an essential oil equal to that of the lemon. The extract from leaves of the eucalyptus has come largely into favour as a remedy for colds, fevers, &c.

Brisbane, Maryborough, Bundaberg, Rockhampton, and Townsville are ports of registry, and had, on 31st Dec., 1905, 311 vessels on their registers, of a total tonnage of 23,940.

Water Supply

A considerable sum has been advanced from time to time to municipalities and boards for the construction of works for the supply of water to the city of Brisbane and to towns in the State, of which a large proportion has been repaid, leaving at the end of 1905 an indebtedness to the Government of 791,430l.

An important feature of the country west of the coast range is the proved existence of artesian water in some 376,800 of the 668,497 square miles comprising the area of the colony. At least 934 artesian bores have been sunk; the depth ranges from a maximum of 5,045 feet, the depth of the bore at Bimerah Run; 564 of these bores overflow. The daily yield ranges from 4,000,000 of gallons downwards, and the aggregate total output is over 375,000,000 of gallons per diem. Generally stated, the waters are soft, and otherwise of excellent quality. The static pressure at the surface ranges from fully 245 lbs. per square inch, as at the Government bore at Thargomindah, to a few lbs., and the temperatures of the waters range from 196° to 70° Fahr. The amount expended in boring for artesian water is estimated by the Government hydraulic engineer at nearly three-quarters of a million sterling, exclusive of the cost of casings, which are imported from the United Kingdom, and the value of which would very probably reach 120,000l., so that some three-quarters of a million sterling at least represents the amounts expended, chiefly by pastoralists, in improving and increasing the value of the national estate. In addition to this expenditure, Government have expended large sums on the construction of water conservation works on main roads and stock routes, and these works have opened up country, facilitated settlement, and added to the value of public lands.

Irrigation has made a start in the colony, and already about 13,693 acres are artificially watered by some 392 irrigationists. The crop chiefly watered is sugar cane, but vegetables, fruit, and grass lands are similarly treated.

Population.

The population of Queensland, excluding the aborigines, was found by the returns of the census of April, 1881, to be 213,625 persons; a census was taken on the 1st of May, 1886, when it was found that the total population was 322,853 persons, an increase of 51.20 per cent. in 5 years; and the census of 5th April, 1891, showed the population
to be 393,718; of these 223,799 were males, and 169,939 females. The population is mostly either Australasian born or of European parentage. The figures for 1901 do not include all aborigines, but only those living under civilised conditions.

**CENSUS, 31st March, 1901.**

There are above 230 inhabited towns and town reserves. Of these 35 are under municipal government, and contain a population of about 222,397. The receipts of the local authorities, including Water Boards and Shires, in 1905 were £67,840.; their expenditure £66,486.; the assessed capital value of the property in districts under their control £43,685,644., and debt £1,996,348. Debts for water works, amounting to £845,984., which are due principally on behalf of these local bodies, are included in the figures given.

Brisbane, the capital of the State, is beautifully situated on the fine river of that name about 20 miles from the mouth. The city, including its suburbs, had, on the 31st December, 1905, an estimated population of 129,736 (ten-mile radius). It is only about 10 miles in a direct line from the sea coast; the climate is healthy, and during the greater part of the year most enjoyable.

The other chief towns are Townsville (15,506), Ipswich (15,246), Maryborough (12,900), Rockhampton, including North Rockhampton (19,691), Gympie (14,431), and Toowoomba (14,087), Charters Towers (20,976). All these include an area of five-mile radius. (Census 1901.)

**Currency and Banking.**

There were, on 31st December, 1905, 11 banks, with 182 branches. The value of the coin and bullion is given as £1,897,676.; deposits, £13,217,084L. The Government Savings Bank returns the number of depositors as 86,908; the amount of deposits as £3,992,758.

The currency and legal tender is exclusively British sterling.

**Means of Communication.**

On the 30th June, 1906, the railways in Queensland showed 3,137 miles in operation, the cost of construction of opened lines being £21,741,226.; the revenue £1,546,083L., and the working expenses £63,356L. The following lines are now open for traffic:

- **THE SOUTHERN AND WESTERN** from Brisbane to Cunnamulla; with its branches, Ipswich to Dugandan, North Ipswich to Tivoli, Wulkuraka to Kannangur, Dalby to Bell, Gowrie Junction via Warwick and Stanthorpe to the New South Wales border at Wallangarra, Pengarry Junction to Crow's Nest, Wyrema to Pittsworth, Hendon to Allora, and a branch from Warwick to Killarney, and Warwick to Thane. A main coast line is now open southwards, Brisbane to The Tweed, connecting with the Southern and Western line by a loop to Corinda, with branches to Beaudesert, Southport, and Cleveland; northwards, Brisbane to Rockhampton, with branches to New Farm, Enoggera, Pinkenba, Sandgate, Wetheron, Kingaroy, Pialba Cordalba, and Mount Perry, a great copper-mining centre.

- **THE CENTRAL RAILWAY** is open from Rockhampton to Longreach, with branches to Mount Morgan, Springsure and Clermont; also one to Broadmount and to the coast at Emu Park, a seaside resort.

From Mackay, a port between Rockhampton and Townsville, 32 miles of railway are open to Pinnacle, with a branch to Eton opening up good agricultural land.

- **THE BOWEN RAILWAY** is also open from that port to Wangaratta, a distance of 48 miles.

- **THE NORTHERN RAILWAY** is open from Townsville to Winton, with branches to Ravenswood and Richmond having been carried through Charters Towers, the latter town, a great gold-mining centre, having a population of 20,976 inhabitants. The trunk lines all start from the sites of navigable rivers on the eastern seaboard. In the Cook District a railway is constructed intended ultimately to connect Cooktown with the Palmer Gold Fields, 67 miles of which are open for traffic. Another railway is also constructed from Cairns, on the sea coast, to Mareeba, with a branch to Atherton, connecting with the private line to Chillagoe, tapping a large area rich in minerals. A line is also constructed from Normanton, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, to Croydon, 94 miles, southeasterly.

There is also a steam tramway line from Townsville to Ayr, a distance of 50 miles.

There are 515 electric telegraph stations in the State. The number of miles of line 10,154, with 20,786 miles of wire. The receipts of the Post and Telegraph Department were £353,673L.

The number of messages during 1905 was 1,655,691. The telephone is also much used about the metropolis and some of the principal towns; there are now 4,210 subscribers who use it, and cables containing multiple wires are now being laid underground to reduce the inconvenience of a large number of separate wires in the street, and to secure a metallic circuit, and the Revenue amounted to £31,765L.

Communication with London is maintained, via Brindisi and Torres Straits, every four weeks, with supplementary steamers occasionally; via Brindisi and Melbourne every week; via San Francisco and Sydney every three weeks; via Vancouver every four weeks; and via the Cape every month. The average length of passage by Brindisi is thirty-four days. There is daily communication with Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide by rail, and frequent communication with all the other parts of Australasia. The rates of postage are:

Education.

A Government system of elementary education was established by Act 39 Vict. No. 11. The central administration is vested in the Secretary for Public Instruction, and is carried out through the medium of travelling inspectors. Local school committees assist the department with advice and supervision. In 1905 there were in operation 1,044 schools with an enrolment of 106,329 pupils. The schools are free and unsectarian. There are also 161 private schools, with 13,861 children, and 10 grammar schools, with 1,030 pupils, on the roll. A University is about to be established. There are no local rates for education, which in the primary schools is entirely paid for by the State. A system of technical instruction, conducted by Local Committees, is liberally endowed by the State.

Immigration.

The arrivals into the State from places outside the boundaries numbered 40,232, and the departures to all countries 40,424, showing an excess of departures of 192. The arrivals of Chinese numbered 317, and of Pacific Islanders 140, whilst the departures of these coloured aliens numbered 620 and 1,120, and their deaths 99 and 164 respectively.

By Act 53 Vict., No. 2, the number of Chinese to be landed by any one ship is limited to the proportion of one to every five hundred tons of the tonnage of such ship.

Government.

The constitution is regulated by the Letters Patent of 6th June, 1859, and Act 31 Vict., No. 38. The Legislature is formed of two Houses of Parliament, the Legislative Council or the Upper House, and the Lower House or Legislative Assembly. The members of the Council are nominated by the Governor, and hold their offices for life. The members of the Legislative Assembly are elected. There is no property qualification required for membership in either branch of the Legislature. The voting for members of the Assembly is by ballot. Every man of 21 years, who has resided six months in some electorate or electorates, is entitled to be registered as an elector. Persons having property, either leasehold or freehold, or a licence to depasture lands from the Government or a household in any electoral district in which they do not reside, have the right of a vote in the district where such property may be situated, as well as in the district for which they claim as residents. On the termination of the present Parliament early in 1907 the qualifications of electors under the Elections Act Amendment Act of 1905 will come into force. This provides for male and female adult franchise on residential qualification only. A twelve month's continuous residence in the State being the only proviso, subject to disqualifications for insanity, criminality, wife desertion, etc. Owners of freeholds and leaseholds of a certain value possessing a residential qualification in another electorate can elect to be registered for the former in lieu of that within which they reside, but no persons can be enrolled for more than one electorate.

In the Upper Chamber of the Legislature there are at present 42 members, including the President of the Council. By the Electoral Districts Act, No. 10 of 1887, as amended by the Electoral Districts Act of 1892, the State is divided into 61 districts, of which 11 return two members, and 50 return one member each, or a total of 72 members.
