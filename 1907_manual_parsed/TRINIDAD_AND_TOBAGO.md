TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO.

TRINIDAD.

Situation and Area.
The island of Trinidad lies about 16 miles to the eastward of Venezuela, between 10° 3' and 10° 50' N. latitude, and 61° 39' and 62° W. longitude from Greenwich. Its average length is about 48 miles, and its average breadth 35 miles, and its area is 1,754 square miles. It is separated from the continent of America by the Gulf of Paria, into which fall the northern mouths of the Orinoco. The distance between Chacachacare, the most westerly of the Bocas Islands, in which the north-western peninsula of the island terminates, and the Venezuelan promontory on the other side of the strait is only seven miles. The Colony includes the island of Tobago (formerly in the Windward Islands), which was amalgamated with Trinidad by an Order in Council under the Act 50 & 51 Vict., c. 44, on 1st Jan., 1889. By a further Order in Council of the 20th of Oct., 1898, it was provided that, on a date to be fixed by proclamation of the Governor of Trinidad and Tobago, the island of Tobago should be a ward of the Colony of Trinidad and Tobago; that the revenue, expenditure, and debt of Tobago should be merged in those of the united colony, and that the debt due from Tobago to Trinidad should be cancelled. A proclamation was issued bringing these provisions into force from the 1st January, 1899.

History.
Trinidad was first discovered by Columbus, on his third voyage, on the 31st July, 1498; and taken possession of by him for the crown of Spain. No Governor was, however, appointed by the King of Spain until 1532, and even then, and for many years afterwards, the Spanish colonists had the greatest difficulty in maintaining a footing in the island. It was visited by Sir Robert Dudley, and by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595, who signalled his visit by burning the newly-founded town of St. Joseph, and it was included in the Earl of Montgomery's grant, 1628. In 1640 it was raided by the Dutch, and again in 1677 and 1690 by the French. Towards the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th centuries, cocoa was largely and successfully cultivated, but a blight fell upon the plantations about 1725, and Trinidad made scarcely any progress until 1783, when, in consequence of the representations made to the Court of Madrid by M. Rome de St. Laurent, a French planter of Grenada, who, when on a visit to the island, had been struck by its extraordinary fertility, a Royal cedula or proclamation was issued, by which extraordinary advantages were offered to foreigners of all nations to settle in Trinidad, the sole condition imposed, and that not very strictly insisted upon, being that they should profess the Roman Catholic religion. The consequence of this proclamation was a large influx of population, which was soon augmented by many French families, who were driven from St. Domingo and elsewhere by the terrible events of the French Revolution, and to this cause is to be traced the preponderance of the French element in a colony which never belonged to France.

On the 12th February, 1797, Great Britain being then at war with Spain, a British expedition sailed from Martinique for the reduction of Trinidad.

The expedition resulted in the surrender of the island to His Majesty's forces, and on the 18th February, 1797, the articles of capitulation were signed by Sir R. Abercromby, Admiral Harvey, and Chacon, the Spanish Governor.

In 1802 it was finally ceded to the Crown of Great Britain by the Treaty of Amiens.

The population of Trinidad and Tobago, by the census of 1901, was 255,148. The white population is chiefly composed of English, Germans, French, and Spanish, and there is also a large proportion of East Indians, totalling 86,373. The French lower classes speak a patois peculiar to the West Indies.

Constitution.
The Government is administered by a Governor, with an Executive Council of six members. The legislative body is the Legislative Council of Trinidad and Tobago, which was reconstituted in 1898, and now consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the
Inspector-General of Constabulary, the Solicitor-General, the Auditor-General, the Director of Public Works, the Surgeon-General, the Protector of Immigrants, the Receiver-General, and the Collector of Customs, and of such other persons (unofficial members) as the Governor may appoint. The unofficial members hold their seats for five years, and are at present eleven in number.

General Description.

The north coast is rock bound through its whole extent, the east coast is so exposed to the surf as to be almost unapproachable, while the south coast is steep in most parts; only on the west coast is there a good natural harbour, at Chaguaramas. The whole Gulf of Paria, however, is so shut in and sheltered as to afford a most safe anchorage. The Trinidad Dock and Engineering Company, Ltd., was formed and registered in 1906 to carry into effect an agreement under an Ordinance of the Legislative Council for the provision of a floating graving dock and workshops, and for the payment by the Government half-yearly, for 25 years, of a subsidy to supplement the net earnings of the Company for securing the payment to the Company of interest at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum on the initial capital expenditure of £100,000. The dock, which is to be established in the harbour off Port of Spain, will have an over-all length of 365 feet and a clear beam of 56 feet. Its lifting power is to be 4,000 tons, and the Concession provides, amongst other things, that the Company controlling it shall always remain British in character.

There are three ranges of hills running roughly east and west, the most northerly fringing the north coast, and rising in Tucuche to 3,000 feet, the central range runs south-west from Manzanilla point to San Fernando, and the southern runs parallel and near to the south coast. There are numerous rivers, but none of them of any size or navigable, and all running east or west.

The soil is varied, extremely fertile, and excellently adapted to the growth of tropical products, more particularly of sugar and cacao, which are its staples. The quantities exported in 1905-6 were: Sugar, 951,560 cwts.; and cocoa, 432,288 cwts. Molasses, rum, bitters, coconuts, balata gum, fruit, timber, manjack and asphalt are also exported. In the near future it is expected that the mineral resources of the colony will become of considerable importance. Two local companies are working manjack mines at Vistabella and Marabella, near San Fernando, and the Canadian Oil Exploration Company is engaged in developing the Swayaganyary Oil Fields in the south-eastern portion of the island. A syndicate has been formed and registered in London, under the name of the Trinidad Petroleum Company, Ltd., to work oil concessions in the south-western district of the island. A beginning has at last been made in the direction of the establishment of a fruit trade, and in 1905-6, £4,259 worth of fruit was exported to the United Kingdom as a commencement of the industry.

The chief imports are textiles, flour, and rice, dried fish and meat, hardware, machinery, and lumber. Gold is imported from Venezuela to the extent of about half a million sterling annually, and reshipped to Europe. A little more than a third and a fourth of the whole trade of the Colony is with the United Kingdom and the United States of America respectively.

The climate of Trinidad is healthy, and by no means hurtful to Europeans, provided they take reasonable precautions. The average rainfall for the last 44 years, 1862 to 1905, was 65·60 inches. The mean temperature during the year 1905-6 was 77·08 Fahr., the maximum being 86·4 in April, and the minimum 69·3 in February, and the rainfall 68·10 inches.

The island is divided into eight counties.

The chief town and principal port is Port of Spain (population by the census of 1901, 54,100), situated on a gently inclined plane near the north-east angle of the Gulf of Paria. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st March, 1906, 77 vessels registered. Ten miles of electric tramway and 500 miles of telephone have been constructed in Port of Spain and its environs. The latter also extends to some of the country districts.

The borough of Port of Spain was placed on the 1st January, 1899, under the management of four Commissioners, styled "The Port of Spain Town Commissioners," constituted under an Ordinance passed on the 20th of December, 1898 (No. 1 of 1899). The Commissioners are Hon. R. G. Bushe (Chief Commissioner), Hon. G. Goodwillie, Mr. D. B. Horsford, and Mr. Adam Smith.

The next town and port is San Fernando (population in 1901 (census), 7,613), about 30 miles south from Port of Spain.

San Fernando has an elective municipal council and mayor. The chief source of revenue in both boroughs is a rate on property.

A charter of incorporation has been granted to Arima, an inland town about 16 miles from Port of Spain (population in 1901 (census), 4,076). The total municipal revenue of the three boroughs in 1905-6 was £50,904l., the expenditure £41,578l., and the debt, borough of San Fernando excepted, was £31,000l. on the 31st March, 1906.

A pitch lake, 114 acres in extent, is situated in the ward of La Brea, distant by water about 30 miles from Port of Spain; it is of considerable value. It was originally leased to an American Company, but is now carried on by English Concessionaires, the terms being that the Company pays an annual sum of £10,000l., and a royalty on the output in excess of 30,000 tons. The lease is for 21 years from 1st of January, 1888, which has since been extended for a further term of 21 years from February, 1909, conditional on an additional payment of £4,000l. a year for each year of such extension.

The revenue derived from the Pitch Lake in 1905-6 was £36,678l.

Of the total area of the Colony, which is estimated at about 1,195,500 acres, the alienated acreage at the end of March, 1906, was estimated to be approximately 542,308 acres. About 312,000 acres are under cultivation; 577,692 acres remain ungranted.

Means of Communication.

The Gulf steamers proceed as far as Cedros, in the south-western part of the island, a total distance of sixty miles from Port of Spain. Communication between Port of Spain and San Fernando is maintained by means of the Gulf steamers, which ply three times a week, and by the railway. Under a contract between the Government and the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company a bi-weekly service is maintained between Trinidad and Tobago, with regular communication between Port of Spain and all the principal ports of each island.
The railway from Port of Spain to Arima (16 miles) was opened in 1876. The Couva line (18 miles from the junction at St. Joseph, 24 miles in all from Port of Spain) was opened in 1890. An extension of 4½ miles was opened to Claxton's Bay on 1st January, 1881, the extension to San Fernando (7 miles) on the 17th April, 1882, and that to Prince's Town in 1884, and further extensions to Sangre Grande (12 miles) and Tabaquite (15 miles) were opened to traffic on 29th August, 1897, and 13th August, 1898, respectively. Further extension of the railway system is contemplated shortly. There are also 7 miles of tramways or light railways between San Fernando and Savana Grande. The total length of line open is about 81½ miles, all constructed and worked by the Government. The total receipts from the railways, tramways and telegraphs during 1905-6 were £5,682/., and the expenditure was £60,441/.. This last amount does not include the annual appropriation for interest and sinking fund. The interest on 31st March, 1906, amounted to £22,537/.

There is a General Post Office in Port of Spain, a branch office at San Fernando, and about 64 out-offices throughout the island.

There is direct telegraphic communication with British Guiana, Grenada and Saint Croix, and thence via Canada or the United States with Europe. The internal telegraphs now comprise 85 miles, constructed by the Government, and Port of Spain is now in communication with Tobago by means of wireless telegraphy.

The number of steamers calling at Trinidad averaged during the year 57.2 per month. They comprised the following lines, besides some few transient steamers:- Harrison Line, Leyland Line, Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, Navigazione Generale Italiana, Scrutton's Direct Line, Dutch Line, London Direct Line, Canadian, Pickford and Black's Canadian Line, Orinoco Line (Compania de Vapous del Orinoco), Trinidad Shipping and Trading Co., La Veloce, and the Royal Mail Line. The ocean steamers of the Royal Mail Company now call at Port of Spain both on the outward and homeward routes. It is worthy of note that the steamers of the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique are, as a rule, of greater tonnage than the ocean boats of the Royal Mail, and find no difficulty in entering the port. A fortnightly service to New York is carried out by a local firm, and to Canada by Pickford and Black's Line, the latter service being subsidised. Mails are regularly forwarded and received by all these steamers. The rates of postage are as follows, per ½ oz. letter:—

Within Colony ........................................... 1d.
To U.K., India and certain Colonies* ........ 1½d.
To other places ........................................... 2½d.

Coolie Immigration.

Immigration from India is conducted under Government control. Under this head £50,504/. 17s. 8d. was expended by the Government in 1905-6, in introducing 3,604 (Statute adults) immigrants. The numbers introduced in 1896, 1897, 1898, 1899, 1900, 1901-2, 1902-3, 1903-4, 1904-5, and 1905-6 respectively were 3,087, 1,860, 1,292, 1,750, 1,779, 2,475, 2,348, 2,458, 1,219, and 3,604.

*See list at end of Introduction. A new rate on parcels exchanged with the U.K. came into force on 1st January, 1899.

827 Statute adults were returned to India on 3rd October, 1905.

The amount remitted to India during 1904-5 by return Indian immigrants was ... ... ... 14,866/.

Currency and Banking.

The coins in general circulation are British gold, silver and bronze, and United States gold currency. These are all legal tender, but British gold is not often met with. Accounts are kept in sterling by the Government, but in dollars by the public. The notes of the Colonial Bank circulate to the extent of 100,000/- estimated. The Union Bank of Halifax also issues its own notes.

There is no Colonial coinage, but an Ordinance (No. 16.-1903), for the issue of Government 1 and 2 dollar currency Notes was passed on the 23rd December, 1903, and these Government currency notes are now in common use.

There is no limit to silver as legal tender.

The Colonial Bank, the Union Bank of Halifax and the Bank of Nova Scotia have now branches in Port of Spain, the latter having been opened on the 1st September, 1906. Government savings banks are established in eleven districts, with a head office in Port of Spain. The amount in deposits in these banks at the end of 1905 was £30,908 7s. 3½d. The total number of depositors was 15,717. They are under the management of a board, a chief manager of savings banks, and the local wardens.

Defence.

A volunteer rifle corps was established in Port of Spain in 1879. Since then detached companies have been added at San Fernando, Couva and Tunapuna. The force consists of infantry, and a yeomanry corps has also been established with troops in large centres. Total strength on 31st March, 1905, was 369.

The strength of the constabulary force on 31st March, 1906, was 10 officers and 636 Non-Commissioned officers and men exclusive of the band.

Education.

The schools are of two kinds, one secular, and supported entirely by Government, the other denominational, only aided by the Government. For higher education there are the Queen's Royal College (secular), the Roman Catholic Institution, St. Mary's College, and Naparima College (Presbyterian)—the two latter being affiliated to the Royal College. Attached to these institutions are four exhibitions or scholarships of the annual value of 150/-, each tenable for four years, or 200/-, tenable for three years, at some university or other scientific educational institution in the British Empire. There were—at the end of March, 1906—180 students on the books of the Queen's Royal College, 240 on those of St. Mary's College, and 36 in the Naparima College.

The elementary schools are now 240 in number, 51 of which are secular schools, supported entirely by Government, and 195 denominational and assisted. Fees are practically abolished, though at the practising schools and 2 assisted schools 5s. per month is charged. There are 2 Government and 3 denominational colleges for teachers, in which 44 students are trained. The Government schools in 1905-6 had 9,163 children on the rolls, and the assisted schools 31,793.
Besides the public schools, of which mention has been made above, there are many private schools, the largest of which is the Convent Boarding and Day School for Girls. The total number of children attending school in Trinidad and Tobago is probably about 41,500, with an average daily attendance of 23,000. A High School for Girls was formed in Port of Spain during 1906. The teaching of practical agriculture now proves part of the daily routine in the majority of boys' and mixed schools throughout the Colony. 195 schools were examined in Agriculture during 1905-6.

TOBAGO.

History.

Tobago was discovered by Columbus in 1498, at which time it was occupied by Caribs. The British flag was first planted on the island in 1580, and the sovereignty was regularly claimed by James I. in 1608. In 1625 an attempt was made by some adventurers from Barbados to form a colony; but many were killed by the Carib Indians, and the remaining few escaped and settled at Providence. In 1628 a grant of the island was made by Charles I. to the Earl of Pembroke. The island remained unoccupied until 1632, when 300 Zealanders were sent out by a company of Dutch merchants, who styled it New Walcheren. After a residence of about two years these settlers were all destroyed or expelled by the Indians and Spaniards from Trinidad. In 1641 James Duke of Courland obtained a grant of the island from Charles I., and in 1642 two vessels arrived with a number of Courlanders, who settled on the north side of the island. These were followed by a second Dutch colony in 1654, who, having effected a compromise with the Courlanders, established themselves on the southern coast; but in 1658 the Courlanders were overpowered by the Dutch, who remained in possession of the whole island until 1662, when the Dutch Company resigned their right to it. In this year Cornelius Lamspis procured letters patent from Louis the Fourteenth, creating him Baron of Tobago, and proprietor of the island under the Crown of France.

In 1664 the grant of the island to the Duke of Courland was renewed by Charles II. The Dutch refused to recognise the Duke's title, but in 1677 they themselves were compelled to evacuate the island by the French Admiral Estras, who defeated the Dutch Admiral Binks in Scarborough Bay, whereupon Louis the Fourteenth restored the island to the Duke of Courland, who, in 1681, made over his title to a company of London merchants. In 1684, by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the island was declared neutral; the subjects of all European Powers being at liberty to form settlements or carry on commerce but not to place garrisons on it. At the peace in 1763, by the Treaty of Paris, Tobago was ceded by France to England in perpetuity.

In 1781, Tobago was captured by the French under the Duke of Bouillé, after a most gallant defence by the Colonists. In 1783 it was surrendered by treaty to the French Crown. On 15th April, 1793, it was captured by a British force under Admiral Lefroy and General Cuyler, and was once more restored to the French by the Treaty of Peace in 1802, and again reconquered in 1803 by Commander Hood and General Greenfield, and in 1814 finally ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown.

By Order in Council under Act 50 & 51 Vict., cap. 44, Tobago became part of the Colony of Trinidad from 1st January, 1889. By a further Order in Council of the 20th of October, 1898, Tobago became a ward of the United Colony of Trinidad and Tobago, from the 1st January, 1899.

Situation and Area.

It is in N. lat. 11° 9', W. long. 60° 12', distant from Barbados about 120 miles, from Grenada about 75 miles, and about 26 N.E. of Trinidad, and expands N.E. and S.W. The distance between Tobago and Toco (a port of Trinidad) by actual survey made by Mr. Parsons, R.N., in 1865, is 26 miles in a south-westerly direction. It is 26 miles long and 7½ at its greatest breadth, and has an area of 114 square miles, or 73,313 acres, of which about 10,000 acres are under cultivation. About 15,000 acres of land were unowned, and have now been re-vested in the Crown.

The formation of the island is volcanic: its physical aspect is irregular and picturesque, with conical hills and ridges, which descend from a common base or dorsal ridge 1,800 feet high and 18 miles in length.

General Description.

Sugar, rum, molasses, coconuts, and live stock form the principal articles of export. Cocoa and rubber are now, however, being fairly extensively planted. The first sugar exported was from an estate on the Windward side of the island, in the year 1770. In 1780 there were only 3,000 hogsheads shipped; this was increased in 1805 to no less than 15,327 hogsheads. Cotton and indigo were formerly exported. In 1780, 2,619,000 lbs. of cotton and 27,000 lbs. of indigo are stated to have been shipped to England.

The island is divided into seven parishes. Scarborough, the principal town, is on the south side of the island, about 8 miles from the S.W. point, and is situated at the south-western base of a hill 425 feet above the level of the sea, on which stands Fort King George, now without a garrison. The town had a population, according to the census of 1901, of 769. It is a port of registry. Courland Bay, at Plymouth, also has good anchorage. There is a lighthouse at Bacot Point, Scarborough; it is a fixed white light, at an elevation of 128 feet above the level of the sea.

Regular communication with Trinidad is maintained by means of wireless telegraphy, and a service of subsidized coastal steamers, provided under contract with the Royal Mail Steam Packet Co.

Education is in the hands of the Anglican, Roman Catholic, Moravian, and Wesleyan bodies, who are assisted by a Government grant.

Constitution.

The Government was formerly administered by a resident Administrator, subordinate to the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands at Grenada, and a Legislative Council was established by an Order in Council of the 7th of February, 1877, to consist of not less than three persons, designated by Her Majesty.

By an Order in Council of 17th November, 1888, issued under Act 50 & 51 Vict. cap. 44, Tobago was amalgamated with Trinidad, the name of the new Colony being Trinidad and Tobago. The latter island was administered by a Commissioner appointed by the Governor of the United Colony, who was ex officio a member of the Legislative
Council, and one unofficial member of Council is a resident in Tobago. The Commissioner was assisted by a financial board of five members, two nominated by the Governor and three elected. The revenue, expenditure, and debt of the islands remained distinct, but there was entire freedom of commercial intercourse between them, and the laws of Trinidad were, with some specified exceptions, the laws of both.

By an Order in Council of the 20th of October, 1898, the Order in Council of the 17th of November, 1888, was almost entirely revoked, and it was provided that the Island of Tobago should become a ward of the United Colony of Trinidad and Tobago; that the revenue, expenditure, and debt of Tobago should be merged in those of the United Colony; that the debt due from Tobago to Trinidad should be cancelled; that (with some specified exceptions) the laws of Trinidad should operate in Tobago, and those of Tobago cease to operate so far as they conflicted with the laws of Trinidad; that all future Ordinances of the Legislature of the Colony should extend to Tobago, with the proviso that the Legislature should be able to enact special and local Ordinances and regulations applicable to Tobago as distinguished from the rest of the Colony.

This Order in Council was brought into effect from the 1st of January, 1899, by a proclamation of the Governor issued on the 8th of December, 1898. The post of Commissioner ceased to exist, and the post of Warden and Magistrate was created. Various other changes have been made in the direction of reducing the establishments.
