SOUTHERN NIGERIA.

Situation and Boundaries.

The Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria comprise that portion of territory on the West Coast of Africa which is bounded on the south by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the west by the line of the frontier of the French territory of Dahomey, on the north and north-east by the British Protectorate of Northern Nigeria and on the east by the frontier of the German territory of Kamerun. Its area is estimated at 77,260 square miles.

Constitution.

By letters patent dated 28th of February, 1906, the Colony of Southern Nigeria was formed, and was amalgamated with the Colony of Lagos and its Protectorate under one Administration, under the style of the "Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria," with headquarters in Lagos Town.

The Government is administered by a Governor assisted by an Executive and Legislative Council composed of official and unofficial members.

Administration.

For purposes of administration Southern Nigeria is divided into three Provinces, namely: the Western or Lagos Province comprising the former Colony of Lagos and its Protectorate, with Headquarters in Lagos Town; the Central or Niger Province with Headquarters at Warri; and the Eastern or Calabar Province with Headquarters at Calabar; the two latter Provinces comprising what was formerly known as the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria. Each Province is presided over by a Provincial Commissioner and divided into Districts under the charge of District Commissioners and Assistant District Commissioners.

Foreign Money Order and Parcels Post systems are in operation with the United Kingdom, Northern Nigeria, Gold Coast, Sierra Leone and Gambia, and orders are issued for sums up to 40l. at a commission of 4d. per l. There is also an Inland Money Order system, and insurance of letters up to a maximum of 60l. can be effected.

An Inland Telegraph system is maintained by a Calabar Bonny Section consisting of 35½ miles land line and 31½ miles cable. In addition to this an extensive system of telegraphs was initiated at the beginning of 1905, and by the middle of 1906 direct telegraphic communication had been inaugurated between the Central and Western Provinces. The new system, when completed, will render telegraphic communication possible between the chief centres of the whole Colony and Protectorate without having recourse to the cable which at present runs from Lagos to Brass and Bonny in the Eastern Province. At the beginning of the last quarter of 1906 there were 24 telegraphic stations established in the Colony and Protectorate in addition to those along the Government Railway line from Lagos to Ibadan. The principal telegraph stations in the Central and Eastern Provinces are as follows:—Agbor, Asaba, Benin City, Forcados, Ifon, Onitsha, Oguta, Sapele, Warri, Egwanga, Bonny and Calabar, the rate being 1d. per word with a minimum charge of 1s.

Education.

The headquarters of the Director of Education are in Lagos Town. For the Western Province Government inspection and examinations are maintained under the supervision of a Provincial Inspector of Schools and a Board of Education. There are well conducted Mission Schools connected with the Church Missionary Society, and the Roman Catholic and Wesleyan bodies at Lagos, Abeokuta, Ibadan, Oyo and other places. There is also a Municipal School at Ibadan. There are about 4,400 pupils on the school rolls of the various Christian denominations, and the Government grants to Assisted Schools during the year 1905 amounted to 2,294l. The Mohammedans maintain their own schools, where Arabic is taught. Six Government Schools in which elementary instruction in English is given, have been established for this section of the population. Education is not compulsory.

The system of education provides for Primary and Intermediate Schools, High Schools, and Technical Schools. These are of two kinds:—Government, and Assisted Schools; to the latter are awarded grants-in-aid which are earned by examination. The management and supervision of district schools are vested in local committees of management subject to the directions of a Board which meets at Calabar.

In the Eastern Province there are 9 Government Schools, the largest of which is at Bonny. It is residential and provided with a Technical and Industrial Department where carpentering, coopering and other crafts are taught.

In the Central Province there are 17 Government Schools. The most important of these are at Benin City, Sapele, Onitsha and Warri.

There is a High School at Calabar under the management of the United Presbyterian Free Church of Scotland, styled the Hope Waddell Training Institute. This school is financed by Government in part and under certain conditions. The Roman Catholic Mission has extended its sphere of work on the Niger, and has erected boys' and girls' schools at Calabar. In addition to the above a number of schools are conducted by the Church Missionary Society, the Niger Delta Pastorate Mission, the Primitive Methodist Mission and the Onitsha Industrial Mission.

There are 24 Mission Schools on the list of Government Assisted Schools in the Central, and 19 in the Eastern Province.

Defence.

The Military Force consists of the Southern Nigeria Regiment of the West African Frontier Force, with an establishment of two battalions and Artillery and Headquarter Staff, the total strength of the Regiment being 63 Officers, 34 British Non-commissioned Officers, and 1,883 rank and file. The Civil Police Force maintained numbers 980, including nine European officers.
WESTERN OR LAGOS PROVINCE

Is situated on the Bight of Benin, and consists of the coast line from the boundary of Dahomey on the west, to the boundary line of the Central Province, one mile south-east of the village of Omoluma, on the confines of the Shekiri Country, on the Mahin Beach on the east, and includes Badagry, Lagos Island, upon which is situated Lagos Town (capital of the Colony and Protectorate), Ebute Metta, Iddo Island, Ikorodu, Ejirin, and Epe, with Palma, Leckie, and Ode.

Ikorodu is the latest acquisition to the Colony (ceded August, 1894), and the Jebu strip on the north bank of the lagoon now extends from Orichi on the Ogun River, in a direct line half a mile to the north of the village of Majoda, situated on the road between Epe and Jebu Ode, and from thence proceeding due east to the Oshun River. By this acquisition the Colony commands all the main routes to the interior.

The Protectorate before 1900 comprised the kingdoms of Pokra, Okeodan, Ilaro, Addo, and Igbessa, with the Awori country, Jebu Remo (1894), Mahin, Itebu, Ayessan, and Ibu, up to the town of Ogbo on the east.

By an Order in Council issued at the end of 1899 the Protectorate was extended to the boundaries of Northern and Southern Nigeria.

The boundary with Dahomey is at the coast at 2° 46' 55" E. long., and was delimited in 1896 by an Anglo-French Commission as far as the 9th parallel.

For administrative purposes the country is divided into the central, the western, the north-western, the eastern, and the north-eastern districts, with District Commissioners stationed respectively at Lagos, Badagry, Shagamu, and Epe. The police magistrate of Lagos is District Commissioner of the central district. The Shagamu and Ikorodu districts are administered as one, and the Epe and Lekki as one, the respective district headquarters being Shagamu and Epe. In the Hinterland resident officers are stationed at Ibadan, Shaki, Meko, Ijebu-Ode, Ilesha, Ode-Ondo, Oyo and Idoroko. There is also a Commissioner for the railway, who resides in the town of Abeokuta.

Lagos Island has an area of 54 square miles, whilst that of the province as a whole is estimated at 27,640 square miles.

The port is 4,279 miles from Liverpool, 1,203 miles from Freetown, 315 miles from Cape Coast, and 232 miles from Brass. At this part of the West Coast a series of low islands runs along the coast, separating the mainland from the sea, and forming numerous lagoons and creeks. Along these lagoons steamers ply, without entering the ocean, as far as Porto Novo on the west and Siluko on the Ofus Wena River, on the east. The only opening for many miles to the sea is at Lagos. Vessels drawing more than 10ft.6in. cannot safely get over the bar; passengers are transferred into tenders by means of surf boats, and the vessels proceed with most of their cargoes to Forcados, a distance of 200 miles, and there tranship into tenders.

History.

The King of Lagos (Kosoko), having refused to co-operate in putting down the slave trade, was expelled by a British force in 1851, and his cousin Akitoye placed on the throne, by whom a treaty was concluded under which he bound himself to put down the slave trade. A Consul was appointed, but the treaty was not fully adhered to by Akitoye's son and successor, King Docemo, who was induced on the 6th of August, 1861, to cede his possessions to the British Crown in consideration of a pension of £1,000 a year, which he continued to draw until his death in 1885.

The territories were erected into a separate Government by Letters Patent dated the 13th of March, 1863.

By the charter of the 19th of February, 1866, Lagos became a part of the Government of the West Africa Settlements, having a separate Legislative Council, but being subject to the Governor-in-Chief at Sierra Leone.

By the charter of the 24th July, 1874, Lagos became an integral part of the Gold Coast Colony.

By further Letters Patent dated 13th January, 1886, the whole of these territories were separated from the Gold Coast Colony, and erected into a separate Colony.

The original British settlements were Lagos Island and Iddo Island. In 1862, Palma and Leckie became British, and in 1863 Badagry was ceded by its chiefs. In 1879 the kingdom of Kotonu, lying to the south and east of the Denham waters, was, at the request of the king and chiefs, included in the protectorate, and in 1883 the kingdom of Appa, lying east of Kotonu, was also brought under British jurisdiction. On the east also the protectorate was, in 1885, extended as far as the Benin River, by the inclusion of part of the kingdom of Mahin, and of the Ogbo and Jakri territories.

In 1890, Kotonu was exchanged with the French Government for the kingdom of Pokra, lying between Porto Novo and Badagry.

In 1891 the kingdoms of Igbessa, Addo and Ilaro were included in the protectorate, and in 1894 Jebu Remo was similarly dealt with, Mahin, Itebu, Ibu, and Ayessan being proclaimed protectorates in 1895.

An expedition was sent against the Jebus in May, 1892, which resulted in the military occupation and eventual inclusion into the Colony of a portion of their country, and in the opening of a most important trade route to the interior.

Agreements have been concluded with the Egba native Government, and with the chiefs of the Ibadan, Oyo, and Ife provinces, vesting in His Majesty the King power and jurisdiction therein in all murder and manslaughter cases, and in all cases in which one or both of the parties is not a subject thereof respectively.

Climate.

The monthly average temperature in 1905 varied from 77.1°, the mean temperature for August, to 83.8°, the mean temperature for March. The absolute shade minimum temperature registered during the year was 69° in June and October, the absolute shade maximum 93° in March. The rainfall for the year was 65-11 inches.

Industry.

There are no manufactures except the weaving of native cloths and mats, boat and canoe building, and brickmaking. A saw mill has been established, and native builders, carpenters, and blacksmiths do fair work.

Fishing is extensively pursued in the island waters, the fish being dried and sent into the interior.
Cotton planting has been commenced under the auspices of the Government, and the prospects are encouraging.

The British Cotton Growing Association have now, by arrangement with the Colonial Office, taken over the management of the industry, and very considerable tracts of land at Ilugan, near Ibadan, and between Aro and Abeokuta, have been drained, cleaned and planted.

An export trade in corn (maize) has recently sprung up, and is steadily growing.

A small sugar mill has also been erected at Agbowa, in the Colony, and there seems a possibility that the sugar-cane may be extensively grown in the near future.

Lagos was formerly one of the chief entrepôts for the export of slaves. It possesses a good harbour, which forms the only safe port along 1,000 miles of coast. It has unrivalled water communication with the interior by means of a network of lagoons and creeks. A very extensive trade has therefore grown up, valued at over £4 millions sterling for the year 1905. There is a large transit trade with Porto Novo and the leeward coast, as well as with the interior. The principal exports are palm oil and kernels, cotton goods, rubber, and mahogany. The chief imports are cotton goods, spirits, tobacco, and hardware, nearly the whole trade being with England and Germany, some exports going, however, to Brazil and France.

The quantities and values of the principal exports during 1905 were—

| Item          | Quantity | Value   |
|---------------|----------|---------|
| Cocoa         | 663,508 lbs. | 10,889  |
| Corn          | 9,384 tons | 32,504  |
| Cotton ginned  | 571 tons  | 15,591  |
| Cotton goods   |           | 21,481  |
| Mahogany      |           | 10,858  |
| Palm kernels   | 45,177 tons| 491,044 |
| Palm oil      | 2,765,969 gals | 179,006 |
| Rubber        | 266,916 lbs.| 22,656  |
| Specie        |           | 175,917 |

Chief Towns.

Lagos Town, including Ebute Metta, has now about 50,000 inhabitants, and is the largest town on the West African coast. Within the Colony Epe may be considered as next in order, with a population of about 16,000. In the interior Abeokuta and Ibadan are believed to contain respectively about 150,000 and 200,000 inhabitants.

The estimated European population in Lagos Town, including Ebute Metta, is 400, and comprises officials, merchants, missionaries, and a few European ladies.

Currency and Banking.

By Ordinance No. 2 of 1880, the legal tender currency, and that generally in use, is British sterling, with gold dust and nuggets, and some Spanish, American, and French gold coins; but by Ordinance 7 of 1894 gold dust and nuggets were demonetised. Cowries (1,000 = 3d.) are still occasionally employed for small transactions. Accounts are usually kept in sterling, but occasionally still in gallons of palm oil, or in cowries by the smaller native traders. A Government savings bank was established on the 1st of January, 1887, under the management of the Colonial Treasurer, and on 31st December, 1904, held deposits amounting to £25,183.16s.

During 1891 a branch of the African Banking Company was established at Lagos, which has since been merged in a company named the Bank of British West Africa.

Means of Communication.

A railway has been constructed from Iddo Island (between Lagos and the mainland) to Ibadan, a distance of 123½ miles, and was opened to the public in March, 1901. The terminus is on Iddo Island, where a fine station has been erected, and is connected by bridges with the mainland and with Lagos. The line is 123½ miles in length, and, excluding the bridges at Lagos, cost about £7,000 per mile. Carter bridge extends from Lagos to Iddo Island, and is 2,500 feet long, carried on steel screw piles some 100 feet long. The Denton railway and road bridges cross from Iddo Island to the mainland, and are 900 feet long. A branch line, about two miles in length, has been opened between Aro Junction (60 miles from Lagos) and Abeokuta. The extension of the line (62 miles) to Oshogbo has rapidly progressed. The 30 miles of the new line as far as Iddo was on 23rd October, 1906, opened to traffic. A steam tramway connects Lagos Town with Iddo railway station. Lagos Island is now in cable communication with the Congo, South Africa, Bonny and Brass, the Gold Coast, and Europe, and via Accra, with the Gaboon, Loanda, Kotomu, and Porto Novo.

There is regular communication with Europe by the steamers of the British and African Steam Navigation Company and the African Steamship Company. A weekly mail service is maintained between Liverpool and Lagos, the time occupied on the outward voyage being about 16 days.

Steamers of the German Woermann Linie also maintain direct communication between Southampton and Lagos at a fortnightly interval. There is also a regular weekly mail service between Lagos and Northern Nigeria.

There is a system of telephones between the various Government Offices and the principal commercial houses in Lagos Town.

EASTERN AND CENTRAL PROVINCES.

Situation and Boundaries.

The Eastern and Central Provinces are bounded on the North-west by the Western or Lagos Province, as described above, on the North by the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria, and on the North-east by the German territories of the Kameruns, whilst on the South and South-west they are bounded by the Atlantic Ocean.

The boundary between the Lagos Province and the Central or Niger Province starts from a point on the sea beach of the Bight of Benin in latitude 5° 52' 20" and longitude 4° 57' 18" about a mile S.E. of the village of Omoloma. The boundary follows a straight line to the junction of the Lagos and the Adabrasa Creeks, continuing up the middle of the Opofanga, Kokotoro, Jojokobo, Kofuturo (or Siluko) Creeks, thence up the middle of the Ofuso-Wena River to its junction with the Owena River, thence up the middle of the Ofuso River to its junction with its tributary the Abere, thence in a straight line to the junction of the Akure and Usho main road with the Ogbesi River.

From this point the Northern Nigeria boundary follows a line from the villages Usho, Amurin to Emure-Ile, thence to Egpeni and along the Owo road through the village of Orea and Suada to the point where that road crosses the Ogbesere stream. It then follows the course of the Ogbesere stream to its junction with the Owese River and then the course of the Owese River to the point where it crosses the Ipele-Iduani road. From here the boundary runs in a north-easterly direction through Iduani and Yaiya, thence easterly to Idogun and Ogpe, thence southerly through Itwa to Ake and on to Ushoka, from which village it proceeds in a south-easterly direction to Shebe and on through Yadu to Aushi; thence through Jattu to Iyere and in an easterly direction through Aioi, Afana, Gufu and Goronu to Fuga. From Fuga the line runs to Yanegpode, and thence in an easterly direction to a point about ten miles north-east of Idah on the Niger. The exact boundary north of Idah and affecting the territory immediately east of the Niger is in course of delimitation.

The boundary continues in a straight line slightly north of the 7th parallel of latitude to a point near Ashuku on the Anglo-German frontier as laid down in the Convention of 1893. From this point the boundary runs in a straight line to the rapids on the Cross River and thence to the Rio del Rey on the Gulf of Guinea.

The area of the Protectorate is estimated at 49,620 square miles.

The numerous rivers, creeks and estuaries in this part of the West African coast have received the name of the "Oil Rivers," from the fact of their producing the bulk of the palm oil, which constitutes the chief export of West Africa. The Niger has formed a huge delta with a coast line of over 200 miles from the mouth of the Benin river to Opobo. The coast district here for a long distance, varying from 20 to 40 miles inland, is a mere network of "creeks" and "Islands." Into this delta several other considerable rivers empty themselves, the chief being on the west, the Benin with its affluents, the Osse, Ologi, Jameson and Ethiope, and on the east the Imo with its affluents the Otamirine and Azumine.

The chief mouths of the Niger are at the Forcados estuary, communicating with Warri, Sapele and Benin, the Nun mouth at Akassa, and at Brass.

The Engenni, New Calabar, and Opobo Rivers enter the sea by the broad estuaries known as the Sombrero, the New Calabar, the Bonny, the Andoni, and the Opobo Rivers, and drain a fertile, undulating country, watered by numerous little brooks, and with a rich soil free from marsh, and where cattle appear to thrive.

Further east is the Calabar estuary, mainly formed by the great Cross River, some 400 or 500 miles in length, which drains, with its affluents the Calabar, Aqua, Akpayfe and the Ndiana Rivers, the high mountain ranges running north-west from the Kamerun mountains to the hills round the confluence of the Niger and the Benue.

Inhabitants.

The inhabitants are typical negroes, and though now divided into several distinct tribes, appear to have had a common origin. Among the most prominent tribes are the Jekri, occupying the lower part of the Benin, and closely allied to the Yorubas; the Ijos, occupying the part of the delta east of the Middleton, and south of the Warri and of the Ibo country; the Ibos, occupying the lower Niger just above the delta, and extending to the Cross River, where they join the Akuna-kumas, being an industrious agricultural people, with fine herds of cattle; and the Efiks and "Kwas" in the Calabar region.

History.

The British Protectorate of the Niger districts (Oil Rivers Protectorate) was announced in the London Gazette of 5th June, 1888. It extended along the West Coast of Africa from a point on the shore of the Bight of Benin about ten miles north-west of the Benin River to the Rio del Rey on the Gulf of Guinea.

The part between the Forcados River and the Nun mouth of the Niger was included in the
territories administered by the Royal Niger Company under their Charter of 10th July, 1886.

By an Order in Council, dated the 13th May, 1893, the Protectorate was extended under the name of the Niger Coast Protectorate, and an administration established under Sir Claude MacDonald, K.C.M.G., K.C.B., as Imperial Commissioner and Consul-General; he was succeeded in this office, in 1896, by Sir R. Moor, K.C.M.G.

On the taking over of the territories of the Royal Niger Company in 1900 the Niger Coast Protectorate was extended so as to include the part lying between Idah on the Niger and the Coast, which had been formerly administered by the Company, and the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria was constituted under an Order in Council, dated the 27th December, 1899, the administration being transferred from the Foreign to Colonial Office.

Law and Justice.

In the Eastern and Central Provinces the Law in force is contained in the Proclamations enacted by the High Commissioner, and Civil and Criminal procedure are regulated by the Supreme Court Proclamations (1900, 1902 and 1903), the Criminal Procedure Proclamation (1900), the Commissioners' Proclamations (1900 and 1903), the Police Magistrate Proclamation (1903), and the Native Courts Proclamations (1901 and 1903).

The Supreme Court, presided over by the Chief Justice, holds Assizes at the principal centres. There are District Courts, with limited Criminal and Civil Jurisdiction, presided over by Commissioners, and there is a Police Magistrate's Court with similar jurisdiction at Calabar.

The Supreme Court decides appeals from the inferior Courts in Civil matters, and the Chief Justice has a power of revision of the decision of Commissioners in criminal cases. The Chief Justice and Puisne Judge are, ex officio, Puisne Judges of the Supreme Courts of Northern Nigeria, while the Chief Justices and Puisne Judges of Northern Nigeria are, ex officio, Puisne Judges of the Supreme Court of Southern Nigeria.

Native Courts have been established throughout the districts. The District Commissioner sits as President of the Court, and in his absence the Assistant District Commissioner. Under the Native Courts Proclamation, 1901, the Courts have, subject to the approval of the High Commissioner, power to make Rules providing for the peace, good order and welfare of the Natives. Native law is administered in all the Courts in so far as it is not incompatible with any Statute and not repugnant to natural justice.

Domestic Slavery.

A system of domestic slavery was, until recently, universally recognised—the father or the mother having the power of sale, according to their position in the "House." The evil was aggravated by that peculiar development of the system known as "pawning," under which a debtor could temporarily liquidate the claims of his creditor by handing over as security either himself or a child or a slave, and by the power which the creditor possessed in turn of handing over the security to his own creditors, the same "pawn" passing through the hands of numberless creditors. By the Slave-dealing Proclamation of 1901 the buying, selling, or pawning of slaves is prohibited under heavy penalties. The system has been effectually abolished in the more settled districts, and is gradually being eradicated from those under less effective control. The Native House Rule Proclamation, 1901, provides for the maintenance of the authority, which is vested in Heads of Houses by Native law and Custom, over members of the House. The law enforces the submission of members to the Head of the House, and upon the latter the performance of those obligations towards the members which native law and custom imposes.

Vital Statistics and Climate.

The estimated European population resident in these Provinces during the year 1905 numbered 533, of whom 199 were officials and 334 merchants or missionaries. The rate of mortality stood for that year at 22·5 per mille.

Sickness is most prevalent during the months of May, July, August, and October.

The rainfall at those stations which are situated on the coast is much heavier than at those inland. The maximum rainfall in 1905 was 167·75 inches at Bonny on the coast, whilst the minimum was 59·42 inches at Asaba on the Niger River.

The mean temperature at Calabar was 81·21°, with a mean daily range of 15·40°. The highest and lowest shade temperatures were recorded at Bonny in the month of February, being respectively 96·21° and 62·13°.

Trade.

The principal articles of export continue to be palm oil and palm kernels, rubber, lumber, ivory, ebony, and ground-nuts. The quantity and value of these articles which were exported in 1905 are shown in the following table:

| Articles       | Quantity     | Value   |
|----------------|--------------|---------|
| Cocoa          | 388,479 lbs. | £6,019  |
| Fibre         | 7,290 pkgs.  | £4,052  |
| Ground Nuts    | 15,800 cwt.  | £6,956  |
| Ivory          | 7,363 lbs.   | £2,263  |
| Palm Kernels   | 63,645 tons  | £59,010 |
| Palm Oil       | 11,391,475 Imp.Gs.| £678,843|
| Rubber         | 2,842,831 lbs.| £226,387|
| Ebony          | 388 tons     | £1,183  |
| Mahogany       |              | £36,314 |
| Lumber         |              | £2,380  |

The export duty on timber brought in 6,407/-, and the lumber trade promises to develop into an important and lucrative industry.

There is an ad valorem duty of 10 per cent. on all articles imported into the Protectorate save those liable to specific duty and those exempted under the Customs Tariff Proclamation.

Efforts are being made to open up the trade of the Cross River, and specially favourable terms, in the way of loans and other facilities, have been offered to pioneers. It is pleasing to record that several applications to secure these terms have been made, and it is hoped that before very long the practical exploitation of the trade of this region will be a fait accompli.

Means of Communication.

There is regular communication with Europe by the steamers of the British and African Steam Navigation Company and the African Steamship Company. There is a fortnightly service between
Liverpool and Forcados, Bonny and Calabar. The steamers leave Liverpool on alternate Saturdays, and call at Monrovia, Axim, Sekondi, Cape Coast, Accra, and Lagos. On the intervening Saturdays there is a service between Liverpool and Forcados. The time occupied in the voyage from Liverpool to Calabar is 20 days. These Companies also maintain intermediate services from London, Liverpool and Hamburg to Calabar, Bonny, Opobo, Brass, Akassa, Forcados, Warri, and Sapele.

Steamers of the German Woermann Line run from Calabar to Lagos in connection with that Company's Express Service between Lagos and Southampton. On the outward voyage there is no direct communication between Lagos and Calabar. Intermediate services are also maintained by the Woermann Line between Hamburg and the ports of the Protectorate.

The Niger is navigable to the Northern Nigeria Boundary for small ocean-going steamers during the months of June, July, August and September, and at other times for shallow-draught stern-wheel steamers and launches. Under the direction of the Government a Transport Department for the conveyance of passengers and cargo at fixed rates has been working on the Niger since 1902. The distance from Forcados to Idah, the Southern Nigeria boundary on the Niger, is 307 miles.

The Cross River is navigable up to and beyond the German boundary during the wet season by stern-wheel steamers and launches, but during the dry season mails and Government cargo can only be conveyed by means of canoes. The distance from Calabar to Ossidinge beyond the German boundary is about 242 miles. A system of regular transport for passengers and cargo at fixed rates is maintained during the wet season.

Chief Towns.

Duke Town, or Calabar, on the river of the same name, is about 5 miles above its junction with the Cross River, and is the headquarters of the administration, with a population of about 15,000. A Presbyterian mission is established there. Creek Town, 4 miles beyond, is also an important place, population about 5,000.

Near the mouth of the Opobo River is the town of the same name built by Ja Ja, and about 40 or 50 miles inland near the same river is Bende, a great Ju Ju centre. Bonny Town, 8 miles from the sea, on the left bank of the Bonny, is a station of the Church Missionary Society, and contains several European establishments. There is also a European settlement at the mouth of the Brass, possessing a very fine church, presented by one of the native chiefs.

Benin City, some 60 miles up the river of the name, is a large town of 40,000 or 50,000 inhabitants. It was formerly the seat of a powerful theocracy of fetish priests, and famous for its human sacrifices. It was taken in 1897, in the circumstances stated below, and is now a thriving trading centre.

The trading station in Benin River is situated about 8 miles from the bar, lying open to the sea-breeze, though sand-flies and mosquitoes abound.

In Jan., 1897, a peaceful mission on its way to the King of Benin was massacred in the bush, and a force of native troops and bluejackets had to be sent to punish the Binis. The expedition was completely successful, the king's forces being defeated, and the king himself driven to take refuge in the bush. The king was afterwards captured, and is now in exile at Old Calabar.

Currency and Banking.

The currency and legal tender is British sterling. A small importation of the Imperial bronze coinage has been made, but at present there appears to be no inclination on the part of the natives to adopt it, the circulation being extremely small.

The native currency of brass rods and manillas is accepted as legal tender in native markets in which they were current previous to the introduction of the Native Currency Proclamation (1902), the rates of exchange being for Brass Rods 4 to 1s., Atorine Manillas 16 to 1s., for Awirawu Manillas 6 to 1s., for Abbie or Prince Manillas, 12 to 1s. and Ama-Ogono or Town Manillas, 24 to 1s., and for Peruckle Manillas 4 to 1s. In the Calabar and Cross River districts there are also in circulation copper wires, known as "Citims," the rates of exchange being 20 to 3d. (one brass rod) or 80 to 1s. Cowries are still used as currency in some parts of the Protectorate, but further importation is prohibited.

Specie amounting to £197,918. was imported in 1906. Of this £82,918. was imported by Mercantile Firms, the balance, £115,000., being required by the Government of Northern Nigeria.

A large proportion of the specie imported for Northern Nigeria filters into the hands of the firms trading on the Niger, and eventually into Southern Nigeria.

The Bank of Nigeria, Limited, has branches at Calabar and Burutu.
