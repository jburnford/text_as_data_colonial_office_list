BRITISH EAST AFRICA PROTECTORATE.

The East Africa Protectorate extends from the Umba to the Juba River, and inland as far as the borders of Uganda. It includes certain mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar—viz., a strip extending 10 miles inland along the coast from the German frontier to Kipini, the islands of the Lamu Archipelago, and an area of 10 miles round the fort of Kisimayu, these territories having been leased to Great Britain for an annual rent of 17,000l. The original concession was made to a company, subsequently called the Imperial British East Africa Company, but the territory was transferred in 1895 to His Majesty's Government, and the whole Protectorate is placed under the control of a Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief. It was transferred on April 1st, 1905, from the authority of the Foreign Office to that of the Colonial Office. The frontiers have been defined by agreements with Germany (1890 and 1893) and Italy (1891). The Protectorate consists of seven provinces and a tract of territory not yet organised lying to the north-west. The provinces are each under a Sub-Commissioner, and are divided into districts and sub-districts as follows: Seyidie (capital, Mombasa), comprising the districts of Vanga, Mombasa, Malindi and Taita, and the sub-districts of Rabai, Takaungu and Taveta; Ukamba (capital, Nairobi), including the districts of Kitui, Kikuyu, South Masailand and Ulu; Tanaland (capital, Lamu), with districts of Lamu and Tana River; Jubaland (capital, Kisimayu), consisting of the districts of Upper and Lower Jubaland; Kenya (capital, Fort Hall), with districts of Fort Hall and Nyeri; the Naivasha Province (capital, Naivasha), including the districts of Naivasha, Eldama Ravine, North Masailand and Baringo; the Kisumu Province (capital, Kisumu or Port Florence), including the districts of Kisumu, Elgon, Nandi and Kericho, and the sub-districts of Lumbwa and Karungu. The two provinces last named were formerly the Eastern Province of Uganda, but were transferred to the East African Protectorate on April 1st, 1902.

The Protectorate has an area of about 200,000 square miles. The total population is estimated at 4,000,000, including 25,000 Asiatics and 2,000 Europeans and Eurasians. On the coast the Arabs and Swahilis predominate; further inland are races speaking Bantu languages, and non-Bantu tribes, such as the Masai, the Somalis and the Gallis. Mombasa is the largest town and also the capital of the whole Protectorate; the inhabitants number about 30,000, of whom 100 are Europeans. It is situated on an island of the same name, possessing two fine harbours, one at Mombasa itself and the other at Kilindini, the latter having a pier connected with the Uganda Railway. The second largest, and perhaps the most important, town in the Protectorate is Nairobi, the capital of the Ukamba Province and the central station on the Uganda Railway. The inhabitants number 5,000, of whom 350 are Europeans, and 2,100 Indians. There are also 200 European farmers and some 50,000 natives in the immediate vicinity of Nairobi.

The prevailing religious beliefs are Pagan, but on the coast Mohammedanism has made great progress. There are in the Protectorate many Christian mission stations, representing eleven different societies—British, French, German, Italian, Swedish and American, two of them being Roman Catholic. At these stations are
schools for elementary instruction and handicrafts. Legislation is by Ordinances made by the Commissioner, the Indian codes being followed as far as applicable. Justice is administered by courts at Zanzibar and Mombasa, and by inferior courts where administrative officers or magistrates preside. In all cases to which natives are parties local ideas and customs are considered. On the ten-mile coast strip domestic slavery is legal, but is practically extinct. No one born after August 1st, 1890, can be a slave, and the purchase of slaves is prohibited. In the rest of the Protectorate slavery is non-existent. The military force consists of 23 officers and 1,000 men, forming the 3rd Battalion of the King's African Rifles; the 1st Battalion is also in the Protectorate pro tem. There are 1,800 police, under 33 European officers and non-commissioned officers.

Foreign imports by sea are liable to duty at the rate of 10 per cent. ad valorem, but certain articles imported for agricultural, stock-breeding, railway and some other purposes are free. There are specific export duties.

In 1905-06 the chief imports were cotton goods, 210,871£; rice, grain and flour, 67,090£; spirituous liquors, 23,934£; building materials, 44,046£. The chief exports were ivory, 20,542£ from the Protectorate, 34,601£ from Uganda; copra, 9,413£; grain, 27,037£; rubber, 18,929£.

### Products and Trade

The agricultural products of the lowlands are cocoa-nuts, rice, maize, and various native grains; cotton and tobacco are also being cultivated. Experiments with a view to a large extension of cotton growing are being made, and the introduction of other seeds and plants of economic value is being tried. In the highlands potatoes grow freely, and are now exported; coffee, wheat and barley are successfully cultivated, but not yet on a large scale. On the uplands enormous pasture grounds are available for cattle.

The forest products of the coast are rubber, gum-copal and timber. Mangroves grow on the coast, acacia and ebony in the scrub forests further inland. The highland forests yield rubber, fibres and castor-oil beans, and contain croton, olive, fig and several good timber trees. The greater part of the forest area is quite unexplored, though a large syndicate has now obtained a concession for cutting timber, and is surveying the forest north of the railway. Several large areas of fibre-bearing land have been leased near Voi and Kibwezi for the purpose of developing the Sansevieria fibre, which is indigenous.

The mineral resources of the Protectorate are not yet well ascertained, but iron is known to occur abundantly in most districts; mica and graphite are found in Ukamba; limestone is worked near Kitui, Makindu and Lake Victoria; opals are common in the Rift Valley; a large deposit of carbonate of soda has been found in the south part of Ukamba; gold mining began, but was discontinued. Recent concessions include prospecting rights and grants of agricultural and grazing land.

Of the imports the value of 227,951£ (34 per cent.) came from the United Kingdom; 173,875£ (26 per cent.) from India; 48,314£ (7·2 per cent.) from Germany. Of the exports the value of 38,796£ (11·7 per cent.) went to the United Kingdom; 23,778£ (7·1 per cent.) to Zanzibar; 24,890£ (7·5 per cent.) to France; 57,872£ (17·4 per cent.) to Germany; and 104,966£ (31·5 per cent.) to the United States.

Mombasa is visited by the steamers of four lines. The vessels of the British India Steam Navigation Company, those of the Austrian Lloyd Company from Trieste, and those of the Messageries Maritimes call monthly; those of the German East Africa line, and those of a branch of this line from Bombay, call fortnightly. Communication between the ports of the Protectorate is maintained by a steamer belonging to the Administration.

The Uganda (Mombasa-Victoria) Railway is worked as a State Railway of the East Africa Protectorate. Its length is 584 miles, with a gauge of one metre. The construction cost to March
BRITISH EAST AFRICA PROTECTORATE—BRITISH GUIANA.

31st, 1906, was 5,309,423l. (approximate). The telegraph is worked by the East Africa Protectorate Postal Department at the principal stations, and at smaller stations by the railway staff. Two steamers on the Lake are also worked in connection with the railway. In 1905-6 (exclusive of railway material) 39,657 tons of goods, 11,869 head of live stock, and 178,789 passengers were carried.

Earnings as follows:

| Item       | £     |
|------------|-------|
| Railway    | 181,846 |
| Steamers   | 22,340 |
| Telegraphs | 743    |
| **Total**  | **204,929** |

Total expenditure 148,251l.

The railway zone extends one mile on either side. The Revenue from rents in 1905-6 amounted to 2,671l.

The Post Office of the Protectorate (exclusive of the Uganda Post Office, which is worked by the Protectorate Post Office), received and despatched 1,342,144 letters, packets, etc., in the year 1905-6.

The telegraph system, including the lines in Uganda, has 1,422 miles of line and 2,590 miles of wire, the railway telegraph line having three wires. The lines connect Mombasa and Lamu (200 miles), Mombasa and Kisumu (584 miles), Kisumu and Entebbe (225 miles), Entebbe and Butiaba (205 miles), Hoima and Wadelai (115 miles), Londiani and Eldama Ravine (18 miles), Lumbwa and Kericho (19 miles), Nairobi and Kiambu (10 miles), and Kibigori and Nandi (12 miles). The Eastern Telegraph Company has a cable connecting Mombasa with Zanzibar.
