LABUAN.

The Island of Labuan is situated on the north-west coast of Borneo, in 5° 16' N. lat., and 115° 15' E. long. Its area is 30-23 square miles. It is distant from the coast, at the nearest point, about six miles, and from Brunei, the capital of the Protected State of that name, about forty miles; and from Singapore 725 miles, or three days' steam.

The average annual rainfall is about 168 inches, and the thermometer ranges from 71° to 93°.

The island, then uninhabited, was ceded to Great Britain by the Sultan of Borneo in 1846.

Much expectation as to the success of the new settlement was founded upon the existence of rich coal deposits in the Island. Hitherto the companies formed to develop these coal resources have not met with great success, but, in 1893, the Central Borneo Company was re-constructed under the name of the New Central Borneo Company, who transferred their undertaking to the Labuan and Borneo Company. This Company, in its turn, was succeeded on the 8th December, 1902, by the Labuan Coalfields Company, Limited, by whom the mines are at present being developed. A certain quantity of coal is turned out every month.

The coal from the Brooketon mine of the Rajah of Sarawak is exported from Labuan, and, in 1905, 11,881 tons were brought over for sale.

Labuan has a fine port (Victoria Harbour), perfectly safe, and easy of access. Vessels drawing 23 feet can go alongside the outside jetty, and vessels drawing 15 feet alongside the old jetties to coal.

A stone pier, with a wooden T-head to allow of coal waggons being directly discharged into vessels drawing 27 feet, has been constructed by the coal company.

Ships are supplied with water at $1 per ton from standcocks close to the piers, and H.M. ships with coal, by agreement, at 15s. per ton.

It is a market for much of the produce of the neighbouring coasts of Borneo and the Sulu Archipelago, such as sago, beeswax, edible birds' nests, camphor, gutta-percha, indiarubber, rattans, tortoise-shell, and béche-de-mer, which are forwarded by the Labuan traders to Singapore. Cattle and goats are reared, and 2,000 acres are estimated to be under cultivation. There are sago factories in the island, where the raw material received from the coast is converted into sago flour, which is exported to Singapore.

There is no bank or savings bank. The currency is Straits dollars and Straits subsidiary coins, Straits notes also circulate in Labuan.

The inhabitants are chiefly Malays from Brunei, and Chinese, the latter being mostly petty traders.

Two schools are aided by Government grants, but there are no Government schools, and education is not compulsory.

The Government was until the end of 1906 administered by a Governor, who, under Letters Patent of 6th November, 1889, alone made ordinances, there being no legislative council. Until the year 1869 the expenditure of the Colony was partly defrayed by an Imperial grant-in-aid, but since then the Colony has supported itself. In 1871 the military garrison maintained by the Imperial Government was withdrawn, and an armed police force substituted by the Colony, which in turn was replaced by armed constabulary from British North Borneo. At the end of 1889 it was arranged that the Governor of the territory of the British North Borneo Company should be appointed Governor of Labuan. This arrangement came to an end in 1905, and from 1st January, 1906, the present Governor of the Straits was commissioned as Governor of Labuan. By Letters Patent issued towards the end of 1906, provision was made for the incorporation of Labuan in the Colony of the Straits Settlements, and the incorporation took effect from the 1st January, 1907.

A railway has been made, 2 feet 5 inch gauge, and of about 10 miles in length, from Victoria Harbour to the coal mines at Coal Point. The railway is the property of the Labuan Coalfields Company, Limited.

The Labuan Water Company was started in 1886, and, with two miles of piping, supplies the town of Victoria and shipping with potable water.

The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company has connected Singapore, Borneo and Hong Kong by cable via Labuan. The nearest point in telegraphic communication with Europe is Singapore.

Steamers go about twice a month to Singapore, and also to North Borneo and Sula. Most of the vessels calling at Labuan are engaged in the North Borneo trade, and ply regularly between the ports of that State, Singapore, and Manila, making Labuan a port of call, while several vessels call for bunker and cargo coal, on their way to and from northern ports of China, and the Philippines.

A rifle range affords facilities for H.M. ships exercising their crews; and provisions are cheaply supplied by a Navy contractor. The Colony has joined the Postal Union and the Imperial Penny Post.*

BRUNEI.

Brunei is a state lying between North Borneo and Sarawak, between 115° and 116° E. long., and touching the sea at Brunei Bay, in which lies the island of Labuan. Out of this original state the territories of the North Borneo Company and the Raja of Sarawak have been carved, and it appears to have been at one time powerful, claiming jurisdiction over a large part of Borneo as well as over part of the Philippines. Its area is now only about 4,000 miles, with a population of about 30,000.

The outlying districts are Tutong, Belait and Tamburong, with others of less importance.

An agreement was concluded with the Sultan in 1888, under which the control of foreign relations was placed in the hands of H.M.'s Government, whilst internal affairs were left to the Sultan.

A further agreement was made at the end of 1905, under the terms of which a British Resident has been appointed to advise and assist in the administration of the State.

The chief town is Brunei, with a population of about 10,000. Trade is chiefly in the hands of Chinese, of whom there are about 100 in the capital. The principal imports are cloth and sundries, and the principal exports coal, cutch, rotans, sago and damar. The trade, to which an impetus has been given by the inauguration of a new system of administration, passes through Labuan.

Concessions and monopolies of all kinds were recklessly granted in the past. Many of these have now lapsed and others have been redeemed.

A cutch factory has been established by a London syndicate at Brunei, and coal is worked by the Raja of Sarawak at Muara (Brooketon) at the mouth of the Brunei river, under the terms of a concession granted in 1882.

The Sultan and his leading ministers would derive a considerable income from the yearly cession payments made by the British North Borneo and Sarawak Governments had they not mortgaged them for years to come. Under the new arrangements the Sultan and his ministers draw fixed monthly allowances from the revenues of Brunei in addition to the amounts recoverable from cession money.

The revenue of the State is derived principally from an opium and spirit farm and from the collection of customs duties.

THE FEDERATED STATES OF THE MALAY PENINSULA.

Relations with Straits Settlements.

The more intimate connection of the Straits Settlements with the Native States of the Malay Peninsula dates from the year 1874, though for many years previous relations of a semi-commercial, semi-political character had existed, as in the case of the commercial treaty between the Penang Government and Perak in 1818.

For some years prior to 1874 the anarchy prevailing in some States in the Malay Peninsula, and especially in Perak, was a source of disquiet to the Straits Settlements community, and a hindrance to the prosperity of British traders.

In the beginning of that year matters were brought to a crisis in Perak, and, with the approval of the Secretary of State, steps were taken by Sir Andrew Clarke to remedy the state of things by the Pangkor Treaty (20th January, 1874). Later on in the year British Residents were stationed in the States of Perak, Selangor, and Sungei Ujong, to advise their rulers respecting the collection of revenue and general administration.

The events leading to the establishment of the Protected State, known as the Negri Sembilan (Nine States), began in 1883, when closer relations were entered into with the State of Rembau; a federation was formed in 1889 by Sir C. C. Smith, and the officer, styled Superintendent from the time of his appointment in 1886, was created British Resident.

In 1895 this office was combined with that of the Resident of Sungei Ujong, who since 1885 had exercised control also over the administration of the adjacent inland State of Jelebu, and, in August of that year, an agreement was signed by the chiefs, by which the present Federal State (which retains the old title) was constituted.

In 1887 Sir F. Weld made an agreement with the Raja of Pahang, in accordance with which the control of his foreign relations, &c., was surrendered to the British Government. This was followed by a further agreement in 1888, between the Raja (now styled Sultan) and Governor Sir C. C. Smith, under which Pahang was taken under British protection, on the same terms as the Protected Native States on the west coast of the Peninsula; a British Resident being appointed, at the request of the Sultan, in September of that year.

The Residents of these four States are assisted by a staff of European officers, whose duty it is to carry out the executive functions. The supreme authority in each State is vested in the State Council, consisting of the highest native chiefs presided over by the Sultan or Ruler of the State, who is assisted by the Resident, and, in Perak and Selangor, the Secretary to the Resident. In the three older States there are also Chinese and non-official European representatives.

The British Residents are appointed by the Secretary of State, and are subordinate to the
Resident-General and to the High Commissioner for the Federated Malay States, who is also the Governor of the Straits Settlements. The administration of each State is carried on, as far as may be, on the model of a Crown Colony.

In addition to the above States, the State and Territory of Johor, with which a treaty had been made as early as the year 1855, and other treaties subsequently, entered into closer relations with the Colony in 1885, when the Sultan, by Agreement of 11th December, 1885 (C.4627), placed his foreign relations in the hands of the British Government, and agreed to receive a British Agent, who, however, has not yet been appointed.

In 1895 a treaty was signed by the rulers of the four States other than Johor, by which they agreed to constitute their countries a Federation (to be known as the Federated Malay States), to be administered under the advice of the British Government. While all existing treaties and arrangements stand, the States agree to the appointment of an officer, to be styled Resident-General of the Malay States, to control the Residents appointed to each State, and to be the means of communication between the State Governments and the High Commissioner. Subject to the authority created by the appointment of the Resident-General, the system of administration under the advice of British Residents remains unchanged.

The States undertake to give each other material assistance in men and money, the wealthier States assisting those in want of help, all moneys so advanced being considered as loans, and also undertake to raise and equip a force of Indian troops for service throughout the States; and should Great Britain be at war with any foreign Power, they engage to supply a portion of these troops on requisition for the defence of the Colony of the Straits Settlements.

It was also provided by the Treaty of 1895 that the rulers of the Federated States named meet periodically in one of the States, under the presidency of the High Commissioner, to discuss affairs of mutual interest. The first of these meetings was held at Kuala Kangsar, Pérák, in July, 1897, and was attended by the High Commissioner, the rulers of all the four States, with their most important chiefs, the Resident-General, and all the British Residents. The meeting was in every respect a success, and many important matters were discussed and arrangements made to deal with them in the councils of the various States.

The second meeting was held at Kuala Lumpur in July, 1903, and was also a pronounced success in every way; the Sultan of Pérák expressed for himself and the other Malay rulers entire satisfaction with the administration of affairs.

Pétrak.

H.H. Sir Idris Mersid-el-Aizam Sham, G.C.M.G., Sultan.

Pétrak is the most northerly of the Protected States on the west coast, touching Province Wellesley on the north and Selangor on the south. It is one of the oldest States in the Peninsula, and, though subject to Achin at one time, and overrun by Kedah in 1821, it generally maintained its independence. About 1850 the discovery of tin in Larut was followed by the immigration of Chinese in great numbers. Since the appointment of a British Resident in 1874, the record of the State has been one of remarkable progress, interrupted only by the murder of the first British Resident, Mr. J. W. Birch, in 1875, the military occupation of the country, and the banishment to the Seychelles of the ex-Sultan and some chiefs implicated in the affair.

The State, which has an area of 6,550 square miles, is well watered, the Pétrak, with its tributaries the Kinta, Batang Padang, Bidor and Sungkai, being the most important rivers. Other rivers of importance are the Krian, the Kurau and the Bernam, with its tributary, the Slim. The mountains on the east boundary, which are part of the main range of the Peninsula, rise to a height of over 7,000 feet.

The chief export is tin. Sugar and rice are extensively grown. The cultivation of rubber is now attracting great attention, and such consignments as have been exported have realised very high prices. In the Krian district the Government has completed an extensive scheme for the irrigation of more than 51,000 acres of rice land, the larger proportion of which is already under cultivation.

Larut, Kinta and Batang Padang are the chief mining districts. The district of Batang Padang lies between the Kinta valley and the Selangor boundary, and contains rich deposits of tin, a little gold and wolfram.

The total mileage of completed roads in Pétrak is 661 miles of metalled cart roads, and 627 miles of bridle and other paths.

The whole length of the State is traversed by the main line of railway from Penang.

The capital is Taiping, in the Larut district, where the British Resident resides.

The chief towns are Ipoh, Kuala Kangsar, Kampar, Tapah and Batu Gajah, and the two ports are Teluk Anson and Port Weld. His Highness the Sultan of Pétrak resides at Kuala Kangsar.

Selangor.

H.H. Sulaiman bin Almerhum Raja Musa, C.M.G., Sultan.

Selangor situated on the Western side of the Peninsula, is bounded on the North by Pétrak, on the East and South-east by Pahang and Negri Sembilan, and on the West by the Straits of Malacca.

The total area is estimated at 3,200 square miles, with a coast line extending for about 125 miles. Where the State touches the central range of the Peninsula there are several peaks of over 5,000 feet and one of 5,812 feet.

The State is drained by four rivers: The Bernam, forming the boundary between Pétrak and Selangor, the Selangor, the Klang and the Langat. The inhabitants are said to be the descendants of a Colony from the Celebes.
this State, as in Perak, the appointment of a British Resident in 1874 followed on the anarchy arising out of disputes connected with the tin mines.

The climate is uniform, and may be described as hot and moist. The nights are cool. The average maximum temperature in the low country is 91 and the average minimum temperature is 71. The rainfall varies considerably, as much as 124 inches having been registered. The wettest seasons are during March and April, and from October to December.

For administrative purposes the State is divided into six districts—viz., Kuala Lumpur, Klang, Ulu Langat, Ulu Selangor, Kuala Langat and Kuala Selangor.

The capital of the State is Kuala Lumpur, which is also the headquarters of the administration of the Federated Malay States. It is the largest town on the mainland of the Peninsula, with a population of 80,000. It has a water supply from an impounding reservoir 7 miles distant, and is also lighted by electricity. There are 5½ miles of town streets. It also possesses a picturesque public garden, covering about 180 acres, and several imposing Government buildings, the principal being the Government offices of modern Saracenic design, with a clock tower 130 feet high, town hall, museum, courts, prison, railway station and offices, and a new post office now under construction. There is also a branch of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China. The currency is the Straits Settlements dollar, with a fixed exchange at two shillings and fourpence. The telegraph system extends all over the State, and the telephone, with the exchange at Kuala Lumpur, is worked over about 400 miles of wire.

There are 53 schools in the State; 46 are maintained by Government for education in native languages, the remainder are grants-in-aid schools.

Port Swettenham, situated at the mouth of the Klang River and 27 miles by rail from Kuala Lumpur, is the chief port, and has wharves capable of accommodating ocean-going steamers. The aggregate tonnage of vessels registered during 1905 was 895,935.

The total revenue of the State during 1905 amounted to $8,857,793, and the expenditure to $7,186,146.

There is no public debt.

The principal sources of revenue are customs, excise, railways and land. The only import duties are those charged on opium and spirituous liquors. In 1905 the gross total value of imports was $24,643,619, and the exports $26,633,315.

The chief industry of the State is tin mining. The amount of tin exported in 1905 was 289,686 piculs, valued at $23,412,558. The area alienated for mining is 65,573 acres, and there are about 74,000 Chinese employed exclusively in this industry. Coffeplanting under European supervision made good progress for some years, but received a severe check owing to the fall in price. There are about 18,000 acres under cocoanuts. Rice, gambier, pepper and other products are grown with success. Of recent years the cultivation of rubber has made great strides, especially in the coast districts, which appear to be the locality most in favour by rubber prospectors. Most of the large estates have been converted into and sold to limited liability companies. At the end of 1905 the area alienated for rubber cultivation was about 26,000 acres, of which about 20,000 acres were planted up. The value of rubber exported during 1905 was estimated at $368,801.

There are 476 miles of metalled and 64 miles of unmetalled cart roads, and 215 miles of bridle paths.

Negri Sembilan (Nine States.)

H.H. Tungku Mohamed, C.M.G., Yang di Pertuan of Sri Menanti and the Chiefs.

The Federal State of the Negri Sembilan, as at present constituted, dates from 1895, but a Federation under that title already existed in the last century. The present federation consists of the following States, viz., Sungei Ujong, Jelebu, Johol, and Rembau, and of the six smaller States of Ulu Muar, Jempol, Terachi, Gunong Pasir, Inas, Tampin, and Gemencheh. The headquarters of the Resident are at Seremban; and there are district officers at Port Dickson, on the coast, Kwala Klawang in Jelebu, Kwala Pilah in Ulu Muar, and Tampin. The total mileage of roads in the Negri Sembilan is 388 miles of cart roads, of which 255 miles are metalled, and 133 miles of bridle paths.

The revenue is derived mainly from tin and agriculture. The miners are Chinese, the Malay population being almost entirely agricultural. Gold reefs exist in Gemencheh and on the Muar River. Coffee has been successfully cultivated, and there are many large tapioca and gambier estates. Rubber has also been extensively planted in recent years. There is also a considerable production of rice. A great part of the State is mountainous, the rest consisting of undulating country. The whole State is well watered, the chief rivers being the Muar and the Linggi, the latter of which forms, for some distance, the boundary between the State and the territory of Malacca.

Pahang.

H.H. Sir Ahmad Mattham Shah Almerhum Ali, K.C.M.G., Sultan.

Pahang, the largest of the Protected Native States, is on the east coast of the Peninsula. Its native rulers have for many years looked southward, of later years to the Colony, for protection against their northern neighbours.

Gunong Tahan, the highest point in the State (7,050 feet), was ascended for the first time in 1905 by Mr. H. C. Robinson. It lies on or near the northern boundary between Pahang and Kelantan.

The State is drained by one of the largest rivers in the Peninsula, if not the largest, the Pahang River, which is fed by the Lipis, Jelai, Tembeling, Semantan, Triang, Bera Luit, Lepar and other rivers. To the north the Kuantan and to the south the Rompin and Endau also debouch into the China Sea, the last named forming the boundary between Pahang and Johore.

These rivers are unfortunately so shallow as to be navigable for only steam launches and other small craft, except in the rainy season, and during the north-east monsoon their mouths are difficult of access.

The country is rich in gold, tin and other minerals, and several companies, under European or Australian direction, are at work. The capital has hitherto been Pekan, near the mouth of the Pahang River, where the Sultan still resides, but the seat of government has been removed 200 miles up stream to Kuala Lipis. A line of telegraph has been carried from Selangor over the dividing range to Lipis in this State, and a cart road, 83 miles in length, has been constructed from Kuala
Kubu, on the F.M.S. Railway, to Kuala Lipis. There is a daily motor car service on this road. A branch road has also been made with Government assistance from Tras to Bentong, a distance of some 20 miles, for the purpose of opening up the mines in that district, and trunk roads from Bentong to Kuala Pilah in the Negri Sembilan, and from Bentong to Kuala Lumpor by the Sempak Pass, are under construction.

In the Kuantan district a cart road is being made from the Blat River to the Lepar watershed to open up the tin fields of that part of the State.
