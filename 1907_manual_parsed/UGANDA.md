UGANDA.

The British Protectorate over Uganda was proclaimed on June 19th, 1894, in succession to a brief administration by the Imperial British East Africa Company. The Protectorate was further extended over Unyoro and Busoga on July 3rd, 1896. By numerous subsequent treaties concluded by various officers in the service of the Protectorate, the British administration has spread still further over countries adjoining the kingdom of Uganda proper, and the boundaries of the Protectorate may now be set forth more or less as follows:

On the east the Uganda Protectorate is bounded by British East Africa as far north as the 6th degree of north latitude, Lake Rudolph, River Turkwell, Mount Elgon and the Sio River running into the north-east corner of Lake Victoria; on the south, by the Anglo-Germany boundary and by the 1st degree of south latitude; on the west, by the
frontier of the Congo Free State; and on the north, by an undetermined line between Lado on the White Nile and the watershed of Lake Rudolph; on the north, in fact, it is conterminous with the south-western extension of the Egyptian Sudan.

For administrative purposes the Protectorate is divided into five provinces (Rudolph, Central, Nile, Western, and Kingdom of Uganda), and then again into numerous districts. The King or "Kabaka" of Uganda proper is accorded the title of "His Highness," and his position and rights are regulated by treaty.

During the first years of the British Protectorate an armed force was created from the remains of the Sudanese army of Emin Pasha. To these other recruits were added from the districts of the White Nile, and the force thus organised, together with irregular bands of friendly Baganda, was used to repel the hostile attacks of the King of Unyoro, and later of Mwanga, King of Uganda. Later on an Indian contingent, similar to that employed in East Africa and in British Central Africa, was established. Unfortunately discontent arose amongst a section of the Sudanese force. These Sudanese broke into open mutiny at the end of 1897, and Mwanga, who had escaped to German territory, returned to Uganda and joined the mutineers and Kabarega, rebel King of Unyoro, in December, 1897. The Baganda, however, remained loyal, and after a year's fighting, with some loss in British officers, the mutiny was thoroughly quelled, and Mwanga and Kabarega were captured and sent as prisoners to Kisimayu. In 1901 (Mwanga died May 8th, 1903) they were transferred to Seychelles, where they and a number of followers are maintained at the expense of the Uganda Government. Since the early part of 1899 the country has been perfectly peaceful, and has made considerable progress in commerce.

Uganda itself is separated by about 800 miles from the east coast of Africa, but the north-easternmost extremity of Victoria Nyanza Lake is not distant more than 580 miles. Over this stretch of country, all of which lies within the British East Africa Protectorate, transport was formerly exceedingly difficult, owing to the paucity of inhabitants to act as porters, and stretches of country unhealthy for beasts of burden. Consequently the Imperial Government resolved in 1895 to construct a railway from Mombasa to the north-east corner of Lake Victoria Nyanza. This railway, at the end of 1901, had reached and descended the Kikuyu escarpment, traversed the Great Rift Valley, ascended the slopes of the Mau range to within a short distance from the summit, descended thence the Nyando Valley, and finally covered the whole 584 miles separating Mombasa from Port Florence on Victoria Nyanza, which is the terminus of the railway. The gross expenditure to 31st March, 1903, was 5,384,370l. (about 9,500l. per mile). The traffic earnings (excluding railway stores) were, in 1901, 80,797l., and the working expenditure 378,891l.; and from January, 1902, to March, 1903, 115,313l. and 325,674l. respectively; but 148,148l. was incurred in carrying construction trains and material. Uganda is now in telegraphic communication with Mombasa by a land line, and thence by cable with Great Britain and other countries. A telegraph line has been constructed to Butiaba on the Lake Albert Nyanza, and to Masinde, in Unyoro, and to Wadelai, which it is proposed to connect with Nimule, and eventually to meet the Sudan wire Condokoro.

The trade of Uganda is increasing rapidly. The principal articles of commerce at the present time are ivory, cattle, wild coffee, india-rubber, cotton, chillies, fibres, hides and skins, sim-sim and ground nuts. The country is extremely rich in most African commercial products, and trade already reaches an annual value of about 217,112l. The local revenue for 1904-5 was 59,707l., and the expenditure about 173,039l., 1905-6, revenue, 76,789l., expenditure, 191,142l.

The grant-in-aid for 1903-4 was 130,000l., for 1904-5, 139,850l., and for 1905-6, 103,000l.

The estimated population is:

| Europeans, males | 300 |
|------------------|-----|
| females          | 97  |
| Asiatics         | 3,000 |
| Africans (estimated) | 3,500,000 |
