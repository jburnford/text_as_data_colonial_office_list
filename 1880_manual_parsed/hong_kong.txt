**HONG KONG.**

Hong Kong is one of a number of islands situated off the south-eastern coast of China, at the mouth of the Canton River. Hong Kong is about 40 miles east of Macao, and lies between 22° 9' and 22° 1' N. lat., and 114° 5' and 114° 18' E. long. The island is an irregular ridge, stretching nearly east and west; its broken and abrupt peaks rising to a great height above the sea level. Its length is about 11 miles, its breadth from 2 to 5 miles, its area rather more than 29 square miles. It is separated from the mainland of China by a narrow strait, known as the Ly-ee-moon Pass, which does not exceed half a mile in width. The opposite peninsula of Kow-loon was ceded to Great Britain by a Treaty entered into by Lord Elgin in 1861 with the Government of China; and now forms part of the colony. The general aspect of the island is extremely beautiful. It possesses one of the most magnificent harbours in the world, having an area of ten square miles, the picturesque hills which surround it rising between 3,000 and 4,000 feet high, the whole offering a coup d'œil which blends the wild scenery of Scotland with the classic beauty of Italy. The City of Victoria extends for four miles at the base of the hills, which protect the south side of the harbour, and contains upwards of 6,000 houses of stone and brick. The residences of the foreign merchants are numerous, and most of them are large and handsome mansions. Being built on the slope of the hills facing the sea, the general aspect of the town is perhaps more striking and picturesque from the water than that of any other city in the east, whilst many of the streets are now shaded with well-grown and handsome trees.

The minimum annual rainfall for the last 16 years was 56 inches and the maximum 99 inches, the annual average being 78-54 inches, while the average range of the thermometer is from 43° to 89°.

The Colony was first ceded to Great Britain in January, 1841; the cession was confirmed by the Treaty of Nankin, in August, 1842; and the charter bears date 5th April, 1843.

Hong Kong is valuable to Great Britain mainly as a factory for our commerce with China, and as a military and naval station for the protection of that commerce. Its distance from Singapore is about 1,520 miles.

Hong Kong is the centre of trade in many kinds of goods. Amongst the principal are opium, sugar, and flour, produced in Tungkoon. Salt, earthenware, oil, amber, cotton, and cotton goods; sandal-wood, ivory, betel, vegetables, live stock, granite, &c., &c. The transactions of the tea and silk trade are mainly controlled by Hong Kong firms.

As Hong Kong is a free port, it is impossible to give a correct return of imports and exports, but the enormous extent of the trade with which it is connected, may be approximately estimated from the fact that the amount of Foreign and British tonnage entering and leaving the port annually averages two millions of tons. To this must be added the immense fleets of native craft of all sizes and forms, by which much of the coasting trade of the Chinese Empire is carried on, and also that of Siam, Cochin China, and the Straits. The number of native vessels—dependent of several thousand smaller boats, which visit Hong Kong annually—is about 52,000, with a tonnage of nearly 1,300,000, raising the total tonnage, foreign and native, of arrivals and departures in each year, to upwards of three millions and a half.

Hong Kong is well provided with dock accommodation. There are five docks and three slips which are well supplied with shears, engineer's and carpenter's shops, foundries, and every requirement for making large repairs to ships of war and merchant vessels.

There is telegraphic communication with nearly the whole world; and there is a very extensive steam communication with Europe, America, and Australia.

In addition to the regular mail lines of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company and the Messageries Maritimes which convey the European mails weekly, the Pacific Mail Steam Navigation Company have a fortnightly service, via Yokohama, Japan, with San Francisco, and the Eastern and Australian Mail Steam Company have a monthly service with the Australian Colonies.

Hong Kong's distances from the following places are about:

| Miles | Length of voyage |
|-------|-----------------|
| Canton | 80 6½ hours |
| Manila | 620 3 days |
| Saigon | 910 3 " |
| Shanghai | 800 4 " |
| Singapore | 1,500 7 " |
| Yokohama, Japan | 1,620 7 " |
| Sydney (mail route) | 5,700 29 " |
| San Francisco, via Yokohama | 6,480 30 " |

There is daily steam communication between Hong Kong, Macao, and Canton, and about twice a-week with the ports of Swatow, Amoy, Foo Chow, Shanghai, and other ports more northerly on the coast of China. The communication with Japan is a little over a weekly one.

The occupation of Hong Kong at its outset was effected at considerable cost to Imperial funds, the vote from Parliament in the year 1845 being nearly £50,000, in addition to military expenditure.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council, composed of five officials besides the Governor. The Legislative Council is presided over by the Governor, and is composed of the Chief Justice, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General, the Treasurer, and four unofficial members nominated by the Crown on the recommendation of the Governor.

There is a Police force in the Colony numbering 650 men, of whom 110 are Europeans, 176 Indians, and 340 Chinese.

Hong Kong pays £20,000 a-year to the Imperial Government as military contribution.
