FALKLAND ISLANDS.

The Falkland Islands are situated in the South Atlantic Ocean, between 51° and 53° S. lat., and between 57° and 62° W. long.; they consist of the East Falkland (area 3,000 square miles), the

West Falkland (2,300 square miles), and about 100 small islands with an area of nearly 1,200 square miles. Mount Adam, the highest ground in the colony, rises 2,315 feet above the level of the sea.

The Falklands were discovered by Davis in 1592, and visited by Hawkins in 1594. In 1763 they were taken possession of by France; subsequently, they were held by the Spaniards until 1771, when they were for a time abandoned, and the sovereignty of them given up to Great Britain.

In 1820 the Republic of Buenos Ayres established a settlement in these islands, which was destroyed by the Americans in 1831.

In 1833 they were taken possession of by the British Government, for the protection of the Whale Fishery.

The climate is healthy. During the summer a calm day is unusual. The winds rise at about 10 a.m., and fall away again between 4 and 5 p.m. During the middle of the day, the wind often amounts to a gale. The mornings and evenings are delightful. In winter the weather is less boisterous than in summer, and the thermometer seldom falls below 30°. Ice has not been known to exceed two inches in thickness, and snow seldom lies on the low lands. The temperature, on the whole, is equable. The thermometer ranges from 30° to 50° in winter, and from 40° to 65° in summer. The dryness of the atmosphere in summer is remarkable, and evaporation is rapid.

A peculiar feature in the geology of these islands is presented in streams of stones or fragments of quartz, which appear to flow down the sides of the hills. These streams are twenty to thirty feet wide, and the stones vary in size from one to four cubic feet, and are spread out in the valleys to a great extent. Sandstone, in which are beautifully perfect impressions of shells, occurs in beds. The soil is chiefly peat, but near the surface, where the clay is of a lighter quality and mixed with vegetable remains, it is good soil fit for cultivation. Stone of two or three kinds suitable for building is found in different parts of the islands.

There is a great variety of sweet-scented flowers, which in November and December nearly cover the ground. The tussac grows to the height of seven feet, with a breadth of three-quarters of an inch, feeding on which the cattle get very fat; but it cannot be raised without a strong fence, the cattle uprooting it. On all the small islands along the coast the tussac grass still abounds, but it has disappeared on the East and West Falkland since the cattle have been imported. Anti-scorbutics are very plentiful in a wild state, such as celery, scurvy grass, sorrel, &c., cranberries, and a small red fruit, growing like the strawberry, but in appearance and taste more like a half-ripe blackberry, besides a small plant called the tea-plant, known and much used by the sealers and Gauchos.

Rabbits abound in various parts of the islands, and snipe, geese, swans (black and white), wild duck, dotterel, and teal are plentiful. The harbours swarm during the summer months with excellent fish, and trout, weighing from one to two pounds, are to be found in the rivers and lakes of the interior, and hares have recently been imported, and are doing well.

Wild cattle, horses, and pigs are very numerous. Sheep have been introduced, and found to do exceedingly well. The wool is of excellent quality and realizes a high price in the London markets. The exports consists of wool hides, horns, hoofs, bones, and tallow.

There is mail communication with England eight times a year, via Monte Video, between which point and Stanley the mails are carried by the Falkland Islands Company's schooner "Black Hawk." The voyage between the Falklands and England takes about six weeks.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive and Legislative Council. The members of both Councils are appointed by the Crown.

The tonnage of vessels entered in 1878 was 7,287 tons.

The export of wool in 1878 was 1,253,249 lbs., worth £5,732.
