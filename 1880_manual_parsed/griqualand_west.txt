GRIQUALAND WEST.

Griqualand West is situated between 22° and 26° E. long. and 27° and 29° S. lat. Became British territory by cession from the Griqua people, a race of half-castes, in the year 1871, and was proclaimed to have been ceded by the Griqua Government, and to have been accepted in the name of Her Majesty the Queen by His Excellency Sir Henry Barkly, Governor of the Cape of Good Hope, and Her Majesty's High Commissioner in South Africa, on October 27 in that year.

In the previous year, 1870, the existence of large deposits of diamonds along the banks of the Vaal River had been so conclusively proved, as to attract to Griqualand thousands of Cape and Natal Colonists, together with some practical diggers from Australia, and persons of every rank and condition from Europe and America.

Prior to the acceptance of the Griqua territory by Her Majesty, differences had existed between the Griqua Government and the Government of the Orange Free State respecting boundaries, and endeavours had been made for the settlement of those differences by arbitration, which had failed of success owing to the inability of the parties to agree on a plan of arbitration in detail. While leaving the questions in dispute still open for such settlement, Sir Henry Barkly declared the boundary line between the Free State and the territory ceded to Her Majesty by the Griquas to be that which had existed and been formerly agreed upon between East and West Griqualand prior to the existence of the Orange Free State, viz., from Ramah on the Orange River via David's Grave, to Platberg. This was the eastern boundary of the territory. The northern and western boundaries had previously been defined by the "Keate award" of 1871, and the southern boundary (between Griqualand and the Cape Colony) was the Orange River, about which no dispute existed.

The area between these boundaries is in extent about 17,800 square miles, and its population prior to the discovery of diamonds consisted of the Griquas, certain Europeans to whom farms had been assigned by the Griqua Government in a portion of the territory designated South Albania, and citizens of the Orange Free State, who had acquired lands in the territory under Free State titles, and were almost exclusively occupied in stock farming.

Simultaneously with the issue of the proclamation for incorporating this territory with the British Empire, other proclamations were issued providing for its Government, the administration of the law, and the conduct of public business, pending its annexation to the colony of the Cape of Good Hope. In 1872 the discovery of the four diamond mines known as the "Dry Diggings," in the flat grass country between the Vaal and Modder Rivers, had collected a large population there, which was impatient of control, and greatly dissatisfied with a form of Government which necessitated a reference to Cape Town, more than 600 miles distant, on every question of importance. At length they assumed such an attitude that in September the Governor felt it his duty to proceed to Griqualand, and assume the personal direction of affairs. As a result of his visit he recommended that the territory should be formed into a separate and distinct Government, under a Lieutenant-Governor, and that a Constitution should be granted to it. This recommendation was acceded to by Her Majesty, and Mr. Southey, C.M.G., who had for many years held high office in the Cape Colony, was appointed the first Lieutenant-Governor. In 1875 the condition of the finances rendered it necessary to reduce the civil establishment, and the office of Lieutenant-Governor, as well as that of Secretary to Government, was discontinued, and an Administrator appointed.

The letters patent by which the Constitution was granted, and these territories thereby created a separate and distinct province, bear date at Westminster, the 7th day of February, in the thirty-sixth year of Her Majesty's reign; and they provide, among other things, that the Governor of the Cape Colony, or Officer administering the government of that colony, shall be Governor of Griqualand West; that in the absence of the said Governor from the province, the Government shall be administered by a Lieutenant-Governor or Administrator; that for advising the said Governor there shall be an Executive Council consisting of such persons as shall be duly appointed to it; and that there shall also be within the Province a Legislative Council, composed of four nominated and four elective members.

The claims of the Orange Free State, in the territory of Griqualand West, without being admitted, were set at rest in an amicable manner by a Convention concluded in London, on the 19th of July, 1876, between President Brand and the Secretary of State for the Colonies. By the terms of this convention the Orange Free State agreed to abandon its claims in consideration of a payment by the Province of 90,000l., while at the same time a slight modification of the eastern frontier line was accorded to the Orange Free State, which line has been surveyed and marked by a joint commission.

Land.

The lands of the Province afford excellent pasturage for all kinds of stock, and in particular for sheep, horned cattle, horses, and ostriches; and where water is available for irrigation, the cultivation of wheat and other cereals, and almost all kinds of farm and garden produce can be profitably undertaken. The land is fertile, and yields abundant crops.

Mining.

The great industry of diamond seeking has during the last two years continued very remunerative, though the reduced price of diamonds in the English and European markets, and the increased cost of working at the Dry Diggings, as the mines grow deeper, have been disheartening to the poorer diggers and to those who expected a rapid fortune.

The history of these Diamond Fields is briefly as follows:—The first diamond was found by accident, in 1867, and passed through many hands before its value was suspected. Even when it was admitted to be a diamond, doubts were thrown on its origin, and the existence of rough diamonds in South Africa was so generally discredited, that nothing like an organized or systematic examination of the country was made for a long time.
A few diamonds, however, continued to be found, and in the year 1870 an exploring party, chiefly composed of officers of Her Majesty's 20th Regiment, then stationed at Natal, and one of Cape Colonists from King William's Town, proceeded to dig and wash the alluvial drift along the banks of the Vaal River. They soon found diamonds, and their success brought numerous other parties from all parts of the neighbouring Colonies and Republics. Operations were at this time confined to the river banks, which for many miles were covered with mining camps.

In 1871, however, the discovery had been made that diamonds existed not only in the drift of the old river-bed near the present course of the Vaal, but in the loose red surface-sand covering the flat grassy country between that river and the Modder, a smaller stream which ultimately joins the Vaal. A vigorous, if not systematic, search soon resulted in the opening of the four mines now being worked at and close to Kimberley, and the river banks were soon deserted for the more profitable Dry Diggings, where diamonds were found in unexampled profusion. There are now 410 claims in this mine, divided amongst about 1,200 claimholders, and the claims are valued for rating purposes at £474,000, the selling price being about 50 per cent. more than that. No valuation of the claims has been made at the other mines. The total number of claimholders at the Dry Diggings on December 31, 1874, was:

| Mine                  | Number of Claimholders |
|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Kimberley Mine        | 1,183                  |
| Du Toit's Pan Mine    | 401                    |
| De Beer's Mine        | 284                    |
| Bultfontein Mine      | 175                    |
| River Diggings        | 151                    |
| **Total**             | **2,144**              |

The method of diamond seeking at the Dry Diggings was at first of the rudest description. The chief reason for this careless mode of working was the absence of water available for washing the soil. Water, which was at first unattainable, has now to be pumped from the mines to keep the claims clear, and is also supplied from wells, which have been sunk in every direction. The result of this abundant supply of water has been the introduction of simple machines for washing the soil—a process which not only increases the yield by revealing many diamonds which before passed unnoticed, but economizes labour, and renders theft impossible in the sorting.

It is estimated by persons who should be able to judge, that the washing machines, of which there may now be some 400 in operation, washing probably 2,000 tons of soil a-day, produce diamonds to the value of 20,000l. a-week.

The largest diamond known to have been found was 288 carats. The highest price given for a single rough stone is 8,000l., being about 100l. per carat. The question whether the title of the proprietors of the farms entitles them to the sub-soil diamonds has been violently debated in the Province, and involving as it did consequences of great pecuniary magnitude to the diggers, at one time led them to acts of lawlessness which rendered necessary the despatch of a body of Her Majesty's troops to the Province to ensure respect for authority. Further trouble was averted by the acquisition of the principal farm, Vooruitzigt, for 100,000l. by the Government.

Trade.

There are at present no industries of any importance except farming and diamond seeking; but trade is vigorous and sound, being almost entirely for cash.

Townships.

The towns of Kimberley and Du Toit's Pan are almost entirely composed of temporary buildings of iron, wood, and canvas. Kimberley is, however, as regards size, population, and business, superior to most towns of the Cape Colony. It has numerous churches and chapels, three banks, and three newspapers. Its market, owing to the high prices given for all articles of consumption, is the best in South Africa.

Native Troubles.

In 1878-9 the tribes and parts of tribes inhabiting the Province and its borders—namely, Korannas, Kaal Kaffirs, Griquas and Bechmanas—were seized with the war fever lately prevalent among the natives of South Africa, and broke out again and again into revolt. It was found necessary to undertake three campaigns against them, under the leadership of Colonel Lanyon and Lieut.-Colonel Warren, which proved entirely successful—the rebels being subsequently treated with a degree of leniency which has turned them into loyal subjects.
