MAURITIUS.

An island lying in the Indian Ocean, between 57° 17' and 57° 46' E. long., and 19° 58' and 20° 32' S. lat. It comprises an area of about 713 square miles.

The Mauritius was discovered by the Portuguese in 1507. They claimed possession of it during nearly the whole of the 16th century. The first who made any settlement in it were the Dutch in 1598, who named it Mauritius, in honour of their Prince Maurice. It was abandoned by them in 1710, and afterwards taken possession of by the French at first, on behalf of the French East India Company, and afterwards, in 1767, on behalf of the Crown of France. Mauritius was during the earlier part of the long war a source of great mischief to our merchant vessels and Indiamen, from the facility with which sorties might be made from it upon our traders by French men-of-war and privateers. The British Government determined on an expedition for its capture, which was effected in 1810. The possession of the island was confirmed to England by the Treaty of Paris, 1814.

Its greatest length from Cape Malheureux to Point Desnus is 39 miles, and its widest part 34 miles across.

It is situated at a distance of 115 miles from Réunion, 915 miles from Seychelles, 1,800 miles from Natal, 2,000 miles from Cape Comorin, 11,000 miles from England, 2,300 from the Cape of Good Hope, and 500 from Madagascar.

Mauritius is divided into nine districts, Port Louis, Pamplemousses, Riviere du Rempart, Flacq, Grand Port, Savanne, Moka, Plaines Wilhems, and Black River.

The City of Port Louis is the capital, and seat of Government, and contains, with its suburbs, a population of nearly 70,000 souls. The harbour is one of the best in the East.

Constitution.—Mauritius is a Crown colony, the government consisting of a Governor, who is aided in executive duties by an Executive Council, and a Legislative Council of Government consisting of certain public officers and unofficial members nominated by the Crown.

Dependencies.—The Seychelles Islands, Island of Rodrigues, Diego Garcia, and others, are dependencies of the Mauritius. Rodrigues is situated about 300 miles east of Mauritius. It is 26 miles in length by 12 in breadth. It is cultivated by colonists from Mauritius.

The Seychelles, or Mahé Islands, are situated between the parallels of S. lat. 4° and 5°; the total number of acres comprised in this group is 50,120; the distance from Mauritius 940 miles. These islands are under the superintendence of a Chief Civil Commissioner (assisted by a Board of Commissioners) at Mahé, who is appointed by the Secretary of State, but is subordinate to the Governor of Mauritius, from whom he takes instructions.

Climate, &c.—From December to April is the hottest season of the year, but it is comparatively cool during June, July, August, September, and October. The temperature in the high lands in the interior of the island is always lower by several degrees than in the city of Port Louis and in the coast districts. The famous tale of Paul and Virginia scarcely exaggerates the picturesque beauty of large portions of Mauritius. The hurricane season extends from January to the middle of April, and the cyclones range from about 8° to 30° S. latitude. The longest days are at the December solstice, and the shortest at the June solstice. The difference of time between Greenwich and Port Louis is three hours, forty-nine minutes, fifty-eight seconds, the latter in advance of the former.

Railways.—There are two lines of railway, the worth Line and the Midland. The former runs between Port Louis and Grand River, S.E.; the distance between Port Louis and Grand River, S.E., by rail, is 38 miles; the second line runs between Port Louis, Mahebourg, and Savanne; the distance between Port Louis and Mahebourg by rail is 35½ miles, and between Port Louis and Souillac, Savanne, 35½ miles. The Midland line will next year be extended to Moka. At Curepipe the elevation is 1,822 feet above the sea. Telegraphic communication is established throughout the island.

Education.—The department of public instruction comprises two branches, the Royal College for higher education, and the Schools Department for primary education. The College is under control of a Rector, who is assisted by a staff of professors. The Schools Department is under the direction of a Superintendent aided by two Inspectors.

The Government schools are supported by the State; the grant schools only partially so. The following tabulation shows the numerical strength of each in 1878:

| Number | Pupils |
|--------|--------|
| Government schools | 54 | 7,519 |
| Grant schools | 58 | 5,514 |

Total 112 13,033

The annual vote amounts to about 19,000l.

There are nearly 200 masters and mistresses employed.

Of the 13,033 pupils 78 per cent. are professedly Roman Catholics, 8 per cent. belong to the Church of England, the Hindus number 14 per cent., and the Mahomedans 5 per cent.

Currency.—All accounts are now kept in rupees and cents of a rupee, which is also the currency of the island.

Weights and Measures.—The Metric System, as regards weights and measures, came into force on the 1st May, 1878.

Military Contribution.—Mauritius pays a maximum of 45,000l. per annum to the Imperial Government as military contribution, but this amount is subject to reduction when the garrison is below a fixed standard; the sum paid in 1878 on account, amounted to 15,000l.

Police.—The total police force on 31st December, 1878, was 660.

Sea Communications.—A monthly service is carried on by the mail steamers of the Messageries Maritimes between Mauritius and Marseilles, via Suez touching at Réunion and Seychelles. The same Company's steamers leave Marseilles once a month (Sunday) for Mauritius. The passage to or back averages 26 days.

A line of sailing vessels has also been established
between Mauritius and Natal, the passage occupying about 10 days. There is also a question of a line of steamers being established between Natal and Mauritius.

* In 1851, the colonial and general mercantile shipping were returned together. The Census in 1851 was taken in November, when there are usually many ships in port; and that of 1861 in April, when the reverse is the case. These circumstances account for the apparent diminution in the shipping return notwithstanding the great increase in the commerce of the island.
