FIJI.

The Fiji Islands lie between 15° and 22° south latitude, and 175° east and 177° west longitude. They are consequently wholly within the tropics. They were discovered in 1643 by Tasman. They number about 255, of which 80 are inhabited, varying in size from Viti Levu, with an area of about 4,250 square miles, and Vanua Levu, with an area of about 2,600 square miles, to the mere coral islet, crowned with a single clump of cocoa-nut trees. The larger islands are mostly mountainous, rising abruptly from the shores to an altitude of from 2,000 to 6,000 feet, clothed to the summits with dense forests and rich grasses. The rivers are numerous, and subject to heavy and sudden mountain floods. Skirting the foot of the mountains and fringing the numerous bays which indent the coasts, are rich alluvial plains, stretching sometimes many miles into the interior. The aboriginal population belongs to the darker of the two great Polynesian families, but, living on the confines of the fairer race, its blood has received some admixture. It was estimated in 1859 at 200,000 in number; in 1868 at 170,000; and in 1874 at 140,000. By the epidemic of measles which occurred in 1875 the population has been reduced to about 110,000. The people were formerly cannibals, but they have now been converted to Christianity by the Wesleyan missionaries.

In 1859 Thakombau, the most powerful chief of Fiji, offered the sovereignty of the islands to Great Britain. This offer, upon the recommendation of Colonel, now Lieutenant-General, W. J. Smythe, R.A. (who had been sent out to investigate the case), was declined by the Duke of Newcastle in 1862. About that time the demand for cotton, owing to the American civil war, led to an influx of Europeans into Fiji for the purpose of cotton cultivation. In June, 1871, certain Englishmen set up a Fijian Government, with the principal chief, Thakombau, as king. This government received the adherence of the Europeans, who persuaded the other chiefs to acquiesce in the supremacy thus claimed for Thakombau. A constitution was agreed upon, and a Parliament elected. The Parliament and the Government before long drifted into attitudes of mutual hostility, and the Ministry latterly governed without the aid of the Parliament, and in a manner at variance with the terms of the constitution. The question of annexing Fiji to Great Britain has been agitated both in Australia and England since 1869 on many grounds, both of local expediency and Imperial obligation; and in August, 1873, the Earl of Kimberley commissioned Commodore Goodenough, commanding the squadron on the station, and Mr. E. L. Layard, Her Majesty's Consul in Fiji, to investigate the facts of the case on the spot, and report as to the best course to be adopted in the matter. These commissioners, on the 21st of March, 1874, reported an offer of the cession of the sovereignty of the islands from the chiefs, with the assent of the Europeans, but on certain terms, which were not acceptable to Her Majesty's Government, and Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor of New South Wales, was despatched to Fiji in September, 1874, to negotiate. This mission was completely successful, and the sovereignty of the islands was ceded to Her Majesty by Thakombau, Maafu, and other the principal chiefs, in a deed of cession dated the 10th day of October, 1874; the form of government, the land question, and the various pecuniary questions then pending being virtually left to the discretion of Her Majesty. A charter has been issued by Her Majesty, erecting the islands into a separate colony, and providing for their government. A Legislative Council is established, to consist of not less than two persons, nominated by Royal instructions or warrant. An Executive Council is also established, and the usual powers of appointing and suspending officers, making land grants, and granting pardons, are conferred on the Governor.

Governor Sir A. H. Gordon arrived in the Island in June, but the Government continued to be administered by Mr. E. L. Layard, C.M.G., until the 1st of September, when the Charter was proclaimed, and Sir A. H. Gordon assumed the Government.

By an Order in Council of the 18th of August, 1877, which came into force on the 4th of February, 1878, the Governor of Fiji is appointed Her Majesty's High Commissioner in, over, and for the Western Pacific Ocean, with certain powers and jurisdiction therein expressed.

The Governor has also been appointed Her Majesty's Consul-General for the Western Pacific.

The climate of Fiji is cool and bearable for the tropics, and the country is remarkably free from zymotic and enteric diseases. Dysentery is the only disease to which Europeans are peculiarly exposed in Fiji. The islands are well adapted for the growth of sugar, the cultivation of which might place their prosperity on a secure footing. Their geographical position, their fine harbours, and the advantages which their occupation affords for preventing and punishing the outrages which have too frequently been practised against the Polynesian Islanders, render their inclusion within the British Dominions an important and fortunate event.

Shortly after the cession, a terrible epidemic swept off not fewer than 40,000 of the natives. The alarm and distrust produced by this visitation, contributed with some other causes to produce in the following year, an insurrection among the imperfectly subjugated mountain tribes of the interior of Viti Levu. This rising was, however, expeditiously suppressed, and the mountain districts
theroughly pacified, the inhabitants all adopting Christianity, and abandoning the use of arms. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, the progress of the Colony has been satisfactory, every year showing a large increase in the revenue and in the amount and value of exports and imports. Considerable progress has been made in the settlement of titles to land, and sugar and coffee cultivation have been undertaken in several localities on a considerable scale. To the natives a large share of self-government has been conceded, their own system of village and district councils recognized and improved, and supplemented by an annual meeting of the high chiefs and representatives from each province, presided over by the Governor. The regulations recommended by these bodies have, however, to receive the sanction of the Legislative Council before acquiring the force of law.

The present European capital of Fiji is Levuka, in the Island of Ovalau, with a population of 550 souls. Suva, on the south coast, with a fine harbour, has been chosen as the future capital.
