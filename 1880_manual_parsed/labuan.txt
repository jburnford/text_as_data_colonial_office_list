LABUAN.

The island of Labuan is situated on the north-west coast of Borneo, in 5° 16' N. lat., and 115° 15' E. long. Its area is 3,023 square miles. It is distant from the coast, at the nearest point, about six miles, and from Brunei, the capital of Borneo proper, about thirty miles.

The island, then uninhabited, was ceded to Great Britain by the Sultan of Borneo in 1846, and occupied in 1848.

Much expectation as to the success of the new settlement was founded upon the existence of rich coal deposits in the island, the development of which was undertaken by a Company which was formed in England at the time, under the name of "The Eastern Archipelago Company." Nevertheless, the coal resources of Labuan remain still comparatively undeveloped, and more than one Company has failed and retired from the undertaking.

Labuan has a fine port, and is a market for some of the produce of the neighbouring coasts of Borneo, and the Sulu Archipelago, such as bees'-wax, edible birds' nests, camphor, gutta-percha, india-rubber, pearls, tortoise-shell, and trepang, which are forwarded by the Labuan traders to Singapore.

There are three sago manufactories in the island, where the raw material received from the coast is converted into sago flour, which is exported to some extent for the Singapore market.

The inhabitants are chiefly Malays from Borneo, and Chinese, the latter being chiefly petty traders or immigrants working under contracts made in Singapore.
The Government is administered by a Governor and a nominated Legislative Council.

Until the year 1869 the expenditure of the Colony was partly defrayed by an Imperial grant in aid, but since then the colony has supported itself. In 1871 the military garrison maintained by the Imperial Government was withdrawn, and an armed police force substituted by the Colony.

The chief sources of Revenue are the forming of licences to sell tobacco, spirits, opium (retail), and fish. There is also a profit derived from the sale of the copper coin of the Straits Government for purposes of trade in the neighbouring archipelago.
