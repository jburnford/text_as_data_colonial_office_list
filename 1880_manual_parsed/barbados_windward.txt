BARBADOS

Is situated in latitude 13° 4' North and longitude 59° 37' West, and is the most windward of the Carribbee Islands. It is nearly 21 English miles
long by 14 in breadth, and is said to contain a superficial area of 106,470 acres, or about 166 square miles.

The exact date of the discovery of Barbados is not known. It is said to have been first visited by the Portuguese, who finding it uninhabited and rude in appearance, named the isle Los Barbados, from the number of bearded fig-trees which they found. In 1625 Sir William Courteen, a London merchant, under the protection of the Earl of Marlborough, who held a grant of the island from James I, fitted out two large ships, one of which only arrived at Barbados, and the party, which consisted of some thirty persons, landed on the leeward side of the island formed a town called James' (or Hole) Town, and appointed Captain William Deane their governor. In 1627 the Earl of Carlisle obtained a grant from Charles I of all the Caribbee Islands. This grant was opposed by the former patentee, Lord Marlborough, but the matter was compromised on the Earl of Carlisle agreeing to settle on the Earl of Marlborough an annuity of 300l. Soon after this the Earl of Carlisle being employed on a diplomatic mission, the Earl of Pembroke, then Lord Chamberlain, obtained a revocation of the former nobleman's patent in his favour, and supported Sir W. Courteen; but on the Earl of Carlisle's return from his embassy, he remonstrated with the king, who reinstated him in possession of the territory. Wolfestone, a native of Bermuda, was then commissioned by the Earl of Carlisle as governor, and in 1628 sixty-four settlers arrived in Carlisle Bay, commenced the erection of wooden houses, threw a bridge across the river which intersected the ground, and laid the foundation of Bridgetown, the present capital. The leeward and windward men opposed each other, the latter ultimately triumphing. As in all new colonies, the inhabitants met with no inconsiderable difficulties. Local feuds were added to domestic privations, but the civil war which raged in England contributed to people and enrich the island; and on the downfall of Charles, many families attached to the Royal cause found shelter in Barbados. The island was afterwards governed by Lord Willoughby, a Royalist, to whom it was conveyed by Lord Carlisle (son of the first patentee); but when the island was subdued by the power of the Commonwealth, he was banished. In 1662, after the restoration of Charles II, Lord Willoughby renewed his claim on Barbados, and the kinsmen and heirs of the two earls brought forward demands on the settlers. To satisfy these claims, a duty of 4½ per cent. on all exports was imposed; and under certain conditions the proprietary government was dissolved and the sovereignty of Barbados annexed to the British Crown. The inhabitants long protested against the imposition of the 4½ per cent. duties, but without success; and it was not till 1838, four years after the abolition of slavery, that the tax was abolished by an Act of Parliament.

Barbados has not, like most of the neighbouring islands, changed owners: it has always remained in possession of Great Britain.

Bridgetown, the chief town and port, is situated in the parish of St. Michael, the principal of 11 parishes into which the island was divided at a very early date. This town contains, according to the census of 1871, 21,363 inhabitants, exclusive of the shipping, which amounted to 418. Recently a most important project for supplying the town with water was undertaken and completed by a joint-stock company incorporated by an Act of the legislature. The works were completed in May, 1861.

Carlisle Bay, the harbour of Barbados, is an open roadstead, which is much exposed to the wind from the south and south-west. There is an inner harbour or careenage, protected by a structure called the Mole Head. The works in connection with this harbour were formerly under the supervision of a legislative committee; but, by an enactment in 1870, its duties were transferred to commissioners, and in 1878 the Executive Council, and five Members of the House of Assembly, nominated and appointed by the Governor, were vested by Act with the care, management, and control of the Molehead and careenage.

The island is almost encircled by coral reefs which in some parts, as in the parish of St. Phillip, extend nearly 3 miles to seaward, and prove very dangerous to navigation. A lighthouse was erected in 1852 on the south point of the island, partly at the expense of the British Government. A harbour-light was also placed on Needham's Point in 1855. Another lighthouse was erected on the east coast (in St. Philip's), and lighted on 1st May, 1875, by a second order dioptric flash light, the latter given by the British Government.

The chief articles planted for exportation for some years after the settlement of the island were indigo, cotton-wool, ginger, and aloes, besides several kinds of woods; and the manufacture of sugar does not appear to have been practised with much success till about the middle of the 17th century, when the cultivation of the sugar-cane increased rapidly, and the plant became, in commercial importance, the island's most valuable production. At that period, too, the introduction of African labour was commenced. It is stated that, in 1863, there were 358 sugar-works in operation. At the present time they number over 500. The produce of 1871 amounted to 53,900 hogsheads of sugar and 33,500 puncheons of molasses; in 1876, 37,848 hogsheads of sugar, and 24,001 puncheons of molasses. In 1879 56,637 hogsheads were shipped up to 15th October, and then there appeared every probability of the crop amounting to 59,000.

The population of the island in 1851 amounted to 135,939; and although it is estimated that some 20,000 were carried off by cholera in 1854, the census of 1861 showed a total of 152,727 inhabitants. By the census of 1871 there are 162,042 inhabitants, of whom 16,560 are white and the remainder coloured and black; the natural increase having been checked by the migration to other West Indian Islands of large numbers of the labouring population. At the end of 1875 the population was estimated at 180,000, from returns of baptisms and burials. Where so great a population exists, great industry is essential to enable the people to live. Thus, labour is cheap, and the productive capacity of the soil has been greatly brought out. The island has the appearance of a well-kept garden, and the roads throughout are excellent.

From an early date, each of the 11 parishes of the island was presided over by a clergyman of the Church of England; but it was not till 1824 that the Bishopric of Barbados and the Leeward Islands, with British Guiana, was erected. In 1842, upon the resignation of Dr. Coleridge (the first bishop), British Guiana and the Leeward Islands were separated from the Windward, and constituted distinct sees. There are at present in the island, besides the bishop, 43 clergymen of the Church of England.

Barbados possesses a college founded by General Codrington, a native of the island, who died in 1710, and whose name it bears. It was affiliated to Dur-
ham University in 1875. It is under the administration of the S. P. G., who are the Trustees of General Codrington's will. There are several theological scholarships of the value of 30l. per annum from the College funds, and four Island Scholarships at 40l. per annum paid from the Colonial Treasury. The latter are confined to natives or sons of natives. Barbados possesses a good grammar school, called Harrison College, in Bridgetown, established on an old foundation endowed many years ago, which has been liberally supported by the legislature, and promises useful results. It has a staff of 5 university men as Masters, and numbers 140 pupils.

A police force was established in Barbados in 1835 by an Act of the Legislature, and is stated to have been the first attempt in the British West India Colonies to establish a force of that description upon a similar footing. It now consists of an Inspector-general, 1 superintending sergeant, 10 sergeants, 20 corporals, and 228 privates.

There is a Harbour Police Force, established in 1867; it consists of 1 Superintendent, 1 Sergeant, 4 Corporals, and 25 privates.

An inland Post Office was first set on foot in 1852; it has since been amalgamated with the General Post Office, whence are delivered all letters, including those from beyond the seas. Through this office a letter may be sent to any part of the island, reaching its destination the same day, for 1d. the ½ oz. Money Orders are granted by the General Post Office upon all Money Order Offices in the United Kingdom (including the Channel Islands) and vice versa. The Postmaster is furnished with a list of these offices. Money Orders are drawn on the Postmaster of Greytown, Demerara.

A lunatic asylum and a lazaretto are also institutions kept up at the public expense: and there is a general hospital in Bridgetown, to the support of which the colony contributes 6,630l. per annum.

There is a station of the West India and Panama Telegraph Company at Barbados.

The island forms the head-quarters of Her Majesty's forces in the West Indies command, under a major-general, who resides in Barbados. The troops stationed in the island are garrisoned at St. Ann's, situated at the southern extremity of the city.

Volunteer rifle, artillery, and yeomanry-cavalry corps were organized in 1859, but were disbanded in 1868.

The Local Government of Barbados consists of a Governor (who is also Governor-in-Chief of St. Vincent, Grenada, Tobago, and St. Lucia), an Executive Council, consisting of the Governor, Major-General, Colonial Secretary, and Attorney-General; a Legislative Council, in which the senior officer commanding the troops sits as senior member, and a House of Assembly, composed of 24 members elected annually. The non-official members of the Legislative Council are appointed by warrant under Royal Warrant, and hold office during pleasure. The Legislative Council has a concurrent voice in making laws with the Governor and Assembly. In former years almost every judicial function in the island was executed either collectively or individually by Members of the Council, who composed the Court of Chancery, the Court of Error, and discharged in rotation the office of Judge of the Criminal Sessions, till the year 1841, when a Chief Justice was appointed. Exceptions to parish rates are heard and determined by the Chief Justice, but the assessments must be confirmed by the Governor in Council before they are levied. The Assembly consists of two members for Bridgetown, and two for each of the eleven parishes, and its duration is limited to twelve months. The qualifications of Members and Electors are regulated by a Franchise Act, passed in 1840, and are as follows for Electors:

1. Possession of estate for life, or in right of marriage, of not less than the annual value of 12l. 6s. 6d., or interest in rents and profits of land of a similar amount.

2. Lessee or assignee of lands or tenements when the rent shall not be less than 64l. 2s. 0½d., and the term of lease was in its original creation of not less than five years.

3. Occupant in any town of any house or premises parochially rated at not less than 32l. 1s. 0½d. per annum.

4. Payment of parochial taxes for two years to the amount of 3l. 4s. 0½d.

The number of registered electors was 1,664 in 1876, when every available vote was registered.

In addition to their legislative functions, the Members of Council and Assembly are called upon to discharge various executive duties, which devolve on Committees, either named by the senior Member of Council and the Speaker respectively, or, in a few instances, selected by the Governor.
