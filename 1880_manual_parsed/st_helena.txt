ST. HELENA.

St. Helena, an island in the South Atlantic Ocean, 800 miles S.E. of Ascension, and 1,200 miles from the coast of South Africa, 15° 55' S. lat., and 5° 42' W. long. St. Helena is 10½ miles long and 6½ broad; its area 47 square miles, or about 30,000 acres.

The capital is James Town, which is on the N.W. of the island. The climate is mild, and little variable; the thermometer ranging in summer between 68° and 72°, and in winter between 57° and 70°.

St. Helena was discovered by the Portuguese Commander Juan de Nova Castella, on St. Helena's day, May 21st, 1501. The Portuguese contrived to keep secret the situation of the island from other European nations until 1588, when it was sighted by Captain Cavendish, on his return from a voyage round the world. St. Helena was uninhabited till the Dutch became possessors of it. Captain Munden, of the English Navy, in 1673, took it from the Dutch, and soon afterwards the East India Company obtained a charter for its possession from Charles II., and it remained under that Company, with the exception of the period of Napoleon's imprisonment there, till 1833, when it was finally handed over to the British Government.

St. Helena is well watered by clear springs, which are abundant. It is situated in the heart of the South Atlantic trade wind, and in the direct track of vessels homeward bound from the East round the Cape of Good Hope. Previous to the opening of the overland route it was a port of call for a vast quantity of shipping and passengers returning from India and other parts of the East, and in consequence of its importance in connection with the Eastern trade, large establishments were maintained, both civil and military. For many years it was also a depot for liberated Africans landed from slavers captured by the West Coast squadron.

Beyond the supply of the passing shipping it has never produced any article of export properly so called, those included in the returns before 1873 being, in fact, reshipsments of imported goods, and the entire trade has, therefore, depended exclusively upon the large sums of money brought into circulation from the several sources above named. These have all been greatly diminished in recent years, in consequence of the opening of the Suez Canal, the considerable reduction in the Imperial expenditure in the island, and the reduction of the squadron consequent on the cessation of the slave trade.

Efforts are now being made to create an export trade. Native-grown fibre prepared by steam machinery from the "Phormium tenax," is found to be of excellent quality; 110 bales were prepared and exported in 1876, 243 in 1877, and the cultivation of the plant is being extended. Superior coffee is also easily produced, but as yet there are only three or four small plantations. The position of the island is well suited for a whale fishery, and it is on this account the resort of a number of American whalers. The oil transhipped to the United States from these vessels at St. Helena, in 1876, amounted to 38,040l. and in 1877 to 82,600l. The island had previously no share in this pursuit, but in 1876 oil to the value of 5,600l., and in 1877 5,800l. was taken by vessels belonging to the port and transhipped to London.

The number of ships calling at the port of James Town for supplies in 1877, including steamers and ships of war, was 664.

The Government is administered by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council.

The Governor alone makes Ordinances, there being no Legislative Council.
