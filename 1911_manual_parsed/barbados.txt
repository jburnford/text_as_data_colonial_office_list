BARBADOS.

Situation and Area.

Barbados is situated in latitude 13° 4' North and longitude 59° 37' West, and is the most easterly of the Caribbee Islands. It is nearly 21 miles long by 14 in breadth, and contains an area of 106,476 acres, or about 166 square miles, somewhat larger than the Isle of Wight.

History.

The exact date of the discovery of Barbados is not known. It is said to have been first visited by the Portuguese, who, finding it uninhabited and rude in appearance, named the isle Los Barbados, from the number of bearded fig-trees which they found. It was nominally taken possession of by the English ship Olive in 1605, when it was almost uninhabited. In 1625 Sir William Courteen, a London merchant, under the protection of the Earl of Marlborough, who held a grant of the island from James I., fitted out two large ships, only one of which arrived at Barbados, and the party, which consisted of some thirty persons, landed on the leeward side of the island, formed a town called James' (or Hole) Town, and appointed Captain William Deane their Governor. In 1627 the Earl of Carlisle obtained a grant from Charles I. of all the Caribbee Islands. This grant was opposed by the former patentee, Lord Marlborough, but the matter was compromised on the Earl of Carlisle agreeing to settle on the Earl of Marlborough an annuity of £300. Soon after this the Earl of Carlisle being employed on a diplomatic mission, the Earl of Pembroke, then Lord Chamberlain, obtained a revocation of the former nobleman's patent in his favour and supported Sir W. Courteen; but on the Earl of Carlisle's return from his embassy, he remonstrated with the king, who reinstated him in possession of the territory. Wolfestone, a native of Bermuda, was then commissioned by the Earl of Carlisle as Governor, and in 1628 sixty-four settlers arrived in Carlisle Bay, commenced the erection of wooden houses, threw a bridge across the river which intersected the ground, and laid the foundation of Bridgetown, the present capital. The Leeward and Windward men opposed each other, the latter ultimately triumphing. The civil war which raged in England contributed to people and enrich the island; and on the downfall of Charles, many families attached to the Royal cause found shelter in Barbados. The island was afterwards governed by Lord Willoughby, a Royalist, to whom it was conveyed by Lord Carlisle (son of the first patentee); but when the island was subdued by the Commonwealth he was banished. In 1662, after the Restoration, Lord Willoughby renewed his claim, and the kinsmen and heirs of the two earls brought forward demands on the settlers. To satisfy these claims, a duty of 4½ per cent. on all exports was imposed; and under certain conditions the proprietary government was dissolved and the sovereignty of Barbados annexed to the British Crown. The inhabitants long protested against the imposition of the 4½ per cent. duties, but without success; and it was not till 1838, four years after the abolition of slavery, that the tax was abolished by an Act of Parliament.

Barbados has not, like most of the neighbouring islands, changed owners; it has always remained in possession of Great Britain.

General Description.

Bridgetown, the chief town and port, is situated in the parish of St. Michael, in latitude 13° 5' 42" North, and longitude 3° 58' 29" West. This town contains, according to the census of 1891, 21,000 inhabitants. Speightstown, the only other town, has about 1,500 inhabitants.

Carlisle Bay, the harbour of Barbados, is an open roadstead, much exposed to the wind from the south and south-west. There is an inner harbour or carenage, protected by a structure called the Mole Head. It is a port of registry, and had registered, on 31st December, 1909, 80 vessels, of a total net tonnage of 17,582 tons.

The island is almost encircled by coral reefs, which in some parts, as off the parish of St. Phillip, extend nearly 3 miles to seaward, and prove very dangerous to navigation.

A geological map, with explanatory memoir of the island, was published in 1891 by Messrs. J. B. Harrison and A. J. Jukes Browne, which show that that area of the island called the Scotland district, which is the part enclosed by a semi-circular sweep of the ridge in the north-east, is composed of sandstones, clays, and fusorial earths, the products of which may be in future a valuable source of revenue to the island; already excellent fire-bricks are made near the end of the railway.

In Schomburgk's history of Barbados there is a short reference to the deposit of asphaltum found in the island, and Messrs. A. J. Jukes Browne and J. B. Harrison casually mention it as occurring occasionally in small quantities, which planters have attempted to burn under their sugar boilers, but not with sufficient success to lead to its general use. In 1885 an American named Julius Pinney suggested to Mr. Walter Morivale, M.I.C.E., late managing director of the Barbados Railway, the possibility of mining it for commercial purposes. A mine was opened by Mr. Morivale on the College Estate in January, 1886, from which about 500 tons of the purest asphaltum were extracted during the year 1888. Other mines have since been opened, and in 1909 the total amount of manjak exported from the island was about 341 tons, of the value of about 2,492£., prices averaging about 10£. a ton. There appears to be a demand for it in the following trades: varnish-making, gas-making, electric cable insulating, asphalt paving, &c.

Much of the geological information concerning the coral area was obtained from borings, &c., made by the Barbados Water Supply Company, whose operations were undertaken with a view to supply the rural population of the different parishes with water up to a height of 750 feet above sea-level. The town of Bridgetown was supplied for many years with an adequate supply of good water by the Bridgetown Water Works Company. Both companies have been bought up by the Government, and the works have now been extended to all the parishes of the island.

Industry.

The chief articles planted for exportation for some years after the settlement of the island were indigo, cotton-wool, ginger, and aloes, besides several kinds of woods; and the manufacture of sugar does not appear to have been practised with much success till about the middle of the 17th century, when the cultivation of the sugar-cane increased rapidly, and the plant became, in
commercial importance, the island's most valuable production. At that period, too, the introduction of African labour was commenced. In 1909 there were 332 sugar-works in operation, 49 are being sold out in small lots and rented in tenancies, 101 have steam works. The produce has been as follows:

| Hogsheads of Sugar | Puncheons of Molasses |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| 1902 ... 52,087    | 42,760               |
| 1903 ... 38,023    | 30,344               |

| 1905 ... 47,097    | 39,379               |
| 1906 ... 57,683    | 61,389               |
| 1907 ... 37,752    | 61,112               |
| 1908 ... 35,832    | 54,428               |
| 1909 ... 17,735    | 69,096               |

The area under sugar cultivation is estimated at 64,000 acres. In September, 1898, the island, in common with St. Lucia and St. Vincent, suffered severely from the effects of a disastrous hurricane. In 1902-3 there was an epidemic of small-pox, which caused a prolonged quarantine and seriously affected trade. Cotton-growing has been revived, with help from the Colonial Treasury and the British Cotton-growing Association, and under the guidance of the Imperial Department of Agriculture. In 1908, 985,526 lbs., of the estimated value of £61,578, were exported to the United Kingdom.

**Population.**

The population of the island in 1851 amounted to 135,393, and has increased steadily since; by the census of 1891 the population was returned at 182,306, and at the end of December, 1909, was estimated at 194,500. The estimated emigration during the year was 22,637. English is universally spoken. Labour is cheap, and the productive capacity of the soil has been greatly brought out. The island has the appearance of a well-kept garden.

**Currency and Banking.**

Accounts are kept in sterling, and British coin is legal tender and the chief medium of circulation. There is no limit to the legal tender of British silver, and there is but little gold in circulation. The only bank doing business in Barbados is the Colonial Bank, capital paid up £600,000, sterling. Total number of branches throughout West Indies 13, with deposits of about £1,500,000, and a note circulation (five dollar notes) of £30,000. In Barbados the estimated circulation is £30,000. There is a Government savings bank, which had, on 31st March, 1910, 19,576 depositors, and deposits amounting to £47,532.

**Internal Communication.**

A railway from Bridgetown to the parish of St. Andrew (24 miles as surveyed) was commenced in 1880, and completed on 10th September, 1882. The total cost of construction was £195,284.; the receipts for the year 1897 were £5,503, exclusive of Government subsidy of £6,000, and the expenses £5,952. Of the subsidy of £6,000 per annum granted by the Legislature, only a sum of £82, 17s. 6d. was paid in 1897, in consequence of the failure of the Company to comply with the provisions of Act 51 of 1896. It belonged to the Barbados Railway Company, Limited, but was on the 15th July, 1898, purchased by the Foreign American and General Trust Co., Limited, for the sum of £50,000. No subsidy has been paid since its purchase by this Company. The whole line has been reconstructed as the Bridgetown and St. Andrew Railway, Limited (28 miles). The cost of construction to 31st December, 1904, was £39,011.; the receipts for 1904 were £5,922.

In 1905 the Company was bought out by the Barbados Light Railway, Limited, and, by a special Act, a subsidy of £2,000 per annum for ten years was granted.

There is telephonic communication between the police stations by 47 miles of line, which cost £1,465., and is open to public use. The Barbados Telephone Co., Limited, a private company, contains a total of 742 services, with a total length of line in use of about 1,200 miles.

**Mail Service, Postage, etc.**

The Royal Mail steamers arrive in and leave Barbados every alternate week from and to England. The usual length of the voyage from England to Barbados is 12½ days.

Besides the Royal Mail, a steamer of Frederick Leyland & Co.'s or the Harrison Line arrives every week from Liverpool.

The direct Scrutton line from London arrives fortnightly.

The East Asiatic (Danish) line of steamers leaving Copenhagen and calling at London, Havre and several West Indian Ports from St. Thomas to Georgetown, Demerara, once a month. Passage from London to Barbados 15 days.

The Quebec Line of steamers arrives about fortnightly from the United States: the Red Cross Line and Booth Line call at Barbados on their voyage from New York to the Brazils and vice versa, at intervals of about 20 days; the Lamport and Holt steamers call at Barbados on their voyage to New York from the Brazils fortnightly. The Canadian Line of steamers (Pickford and Black) from Halifax arrive about every ten days, and the Royal Dutch West India Mail leaves New York fortnightly, calling at Barbados on the voyage to and from Paramaribo, and at Trinidad on voyage from Barbados to New York. The steamers of the Lloyd Braziliero and of the Hamburg-American Lines also call here on voyage between New York and Brazil.

There is a station of the West India and Panama Telegraph Company at Barbados, and direct cable communication with St. Vincent, and thence to the other West Indies, America, and Europe.

Education.

A Government system of elementary education was established by Act No. 41 of the 9th December, 1878, which authorised an expenditure not exceeding 15,000l. annually. This section of the Act of 1878 was repealed, and Section 9 (d) of the Education Act Amendment Act, 1887, authorised an annual expenditure of a sum not exceeding 11,000l. on elementary education. This section has now been repealed by the Education (Amendment) Act, 1910, which authorises the amount to be spent on elementary education at a sum not exceeding 14,200l. Grants to higher education made the sum total of expenditure in 1909-10 17,316l.

The central administration is vested in a Board appointed by the Governor, and the local control conducted by the clergyman of the district assisted by the School Committee. There are 168 schools, with 15,946 scholars (average attendance), and 26,963 on the rolls.

Barbados possesses a college founded by General Codrington, a native of the island, who died in 1710, and whose name it bears. It was affiliated to Durham University in 1875. It is under the administration of the S.P.G., who are the Trustees of General Codrington's will. There are several theological scholarships of the value of 30l. per annum from the College funds—though hardly any of these scholarships are at present available owing to lack of funds—and four Island Scholarships at 40l. per annum paid from the Colonial Treasury. The latter are confined to natives or sons of natives, or of persons domiciled in the island who have resided therein for at least ten years. There is a good grammar school, called Harrison College, in Bridgetown, established on an old foundation, which has been liberally supported by the Legislature. It has a staff of ten university men as Masters, including a Professor of Chemistry and Agricultural Science. The number of pupils at close of 1909 was 182. Another First Grade School, "The Lodge," situated in St. John's parish, to the N.E. of the island, was re-opened in 1882, after having been closed for several years. The number of pupils at the close of 1909 was 47. There are four Barbados Scholarships, established by the Education Board, and endowed by the Colony, each of the annual value of 175l., tenable at an English University, or at an Agricultural or Technical College in Europe or America, for four years.

A first grade school for girls was opened in 1883, called the Queen's College. It has a staff of seven mistresses. The number of pupils was 77 at the close of 1909.

There are four second grade schools for boys and two for girls. These schools cost the Government, including grants for scholarships, 1,100l. annually.

Police, &c.

A police force was established in Barbados in 1835 by an Act of the Legislature, and is stated to have been the first attempt in the British West India Colonies to establish a force of that description upon a similar footing. The Force consists of 3 officers and 324 non-commissioned officers and men. In 1882 the Harbour Police (established in 1867) were combined with the Land Police. A Juvenile Reformatory was opened in April, 1883.

There is a lunatic asylum and a lazaretto; and a general hospital in Bridgetown, to the support of which the Colony contributes 7,350l. per annum.

Constitution.

The Colony possesses representative institutions, but not responsible Government. The Crown has only a veto on legislation, but the Home Government retains the appointment and control of public officers, except the Treasurer, who is an officer of the House of Assembly. The Legislature consists of a Governor, a Legislative Council, consisting of nine members appointed by the King, and a House of Assembly, having twenty-four members elected annually on the basis of a moderate franchise. The qualifications of members and electors are regulated by a Franchise Act, which became law in April, 1884, and which repeals all previous legislation on the subject. By this Act a liberal extension of the franchise was granted, and about 2,208 electors were registered under its provisions, the number previous to its enactment being only 1,641. This and other Acts relating to the franchise was consolidated by the Representation of the People Act, 1891, which became law on 1st January, 1892, and its amending Act of the 14th July, 1898. The only change made was the extension of the franchise to persons enjoying a pension of 50l. a year or more. The number of registered electors for the year 1909 was 2,018. The executive part of the Government consists of the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney-General ex officio, the Inspector-General of Police, and such other persons as may be nominated by the King, one member of the Legislative Council, and four members of the House of Assembly nominated by the Governor. This body is called the Executive Committee, and introduces all money votes, prepares the estimates, and initiates all Government measures. There is also an Executive Council, the members of which are appointed by the Crown. The Governor of Barbados was for many years the Governor-in-Chief of the Windward Islands, consisting of Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Grenada, and Tobago, but in 1885, by Royal Letters Patent, Barbados was separated from the other Windward Islands, and made a distinct Government.
