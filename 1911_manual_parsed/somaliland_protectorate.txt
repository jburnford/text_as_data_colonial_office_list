SOMALILAND PROTECTORATE.

In 1884, a Protectorate was established over the tribes on the Somali Coast, extending from Lahadu (Loyi-ada), half-way between Ras Jibouti and Zeyla, to the 49th meridian E.long. The boundary has been settled by agreements with France, Italy and King Menelik of Abyssinia. Till 1898, the Somaliland Protectorate was administered by the Resident at Aden, as a dependency of the Government of India. In that year, it was transferred to the charge of the Foreign Office, and on 1st April, 1905, to that of the Colonial Office. The chief ports are Berbera, Bulhar and Zeyla. Area about 68,000 square miles.

Exports consist of skins and hides, sheep and cattle, gums, ostrich feathers, salt, ivory, and gold ingots.

Imports consist of rice, dates, cotton piece goods and shirtings, iron and hardware.

All transport is by animals. There is a weekly steamer service with Aden.

The climate at the coast is trying for Europeans, but is healthy in the interior, where an elevation of from 4,500 feet to 6,800 feet is reached.

The Haud waterless plains constitute the principal pastures of the country. The chief source of wealth of the people lies in their live stock.

In the beginning of 1901, operations were commenced against a fanatical Somali leader, the Mullah Mohammed Abdullah, and a native levy with British Officers, under Captain (local Lieut.-Colonel) E. J. E. Swayne, Indian Army, penetrated into the Nogal Valley. After defeating the Mullah at Somala and Fordiddin, and killing 1,200 men and taking 600 prisoners, he drove him into Italian territory.
The dervishes afterwards gathered together again, and a similar expedition, strengthened by the 2nd King's African Rifles (Yaos), was despatched under Colonel Swayne in the summer of 1902, and again drove the Mullah into Italian territory with heavy loss, but met with a severe check in Italian territory at Erego, on October 6th. The Mullah, however, retired as the result of this action still further into Italian territory, to Geladi.

Five months later a third expedition, co-operating with the Abyssinian Army, under Brevet Lieut.-Colonel (local Brigadier-General) W. H. Manning, Insp.-General K.A. Rifles, comprising British and Boer M.I., Indian and African troops, with the main base at Obbia in Italian Somaliland, proceeded to Mudug, thence detaching a force under Lieut.-Colonel Cobbe, V.C., to Geladi, which place was up till then the head-quarters of the enemy. A force of 200 Yaos and Sikhs, under the late Lieut.-Colonel Plunkett, was overwhelmed at Gumburru, in April, 1903, after a fight of the fiercest description. A column of 200 men under Major Gough, being at the same time attacked at Daratoleh, whence it retired fighting to Bohotleh, and in June the expedition fell back on the Berbera-Bohotleh lines of communication, when Lieut.-General Sir C. C. Egerton, K.C.B., was placed in command.

Reinforcements, increasing the force to 7,000 rifles, were despatched and placed in the field, and in January, 1904, 3,250 troops defeated 5,000 dervishes at Jidballi, about 1,000 of the latter being killed.

In March, 1905, an agreement was concluded between the Italian Government and the Mullah Seyyid Mahommed, whereby peace was declared between the dervishes and the neighbouring tribes, both those subject to the Government of Italy and those under the protection of the British Government. The Mullah was given a port on the east coast and was assigned certain territories within the Italian sphere of interest, beyond which he and his dervishes undertook not to encroach.

In the latter part of 1908, some unrest was caused by the unfriendly attitude of the Mullah, and reinforcements were brought into the Protectorate from East Africa, Uganda, Nyassaland and India during 1909.

Arrangements having been made, by arming and organising the British protected tribes, to enable them to defend themselves against attack, H.M. Government withdrew all reinforcements from the interior in March, 1910, and administration is now limited to the coast-belt, as it was prior to 1901.

Pretoria is the capital and seat of govern-
SOUTH AFRICA.

The Union of South Africa is constituted under the South Africa Act, 1909 (9 Edw. 7, ch. 9), passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, on the 20th September, 1909. In terms of that Act the self-governing Colonies of the Cape of Good Hope, Natal, the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony become united on the 31st day of May, 1910, in a legislative Union under one Government under the name of the Union of South Africa, those Colonies becoming original provinces of the Union under the names of the Cape of Good Hope, Natal, the Transvaal and the Orange Free State respectively.

The Act constituting the Union provides for the appointment by the Sovereign of a Governor-General, who, with an Executive Council (of which the members are chosen and summoned by him), administers the executive government of the Union as the Governor-General in Council. Departments of State are established by the Governor-General in Council, the Governor-General appointing not more than ten officers to administer them. Such officers are King's Ministers of State for the Union and members of the Executive Council.

The Senate consists of forty members. For ten years after the establishment of the Union eight are nominated by the Governor-General in Council and thirty-two are elected, eight for each province. The first election was made prior to the establishment of the Union by the two Houses of each of the Colonial Legislatures sitting as one body, and a vacancy will be filled by the choice of the Provincial Council in respect of whose province a vacancy occurs.

The House of Assembly consists of 121 elected members, 51 of whom represent the Cape of Good Hope, 17 Natal, 36 Transvaal, and 17 the Orange Free State. Members of both Houses must be British subjects of European descent.

The qualifications of voters are the same as in the Colonies at the time of union, and no subsequent law is to disqualify any person in the Cape from voting, by reason of his race or colour, who could vote under the existing law, unless the bill is passed by both Houses together, with a two-thirds majority of the total membership. [In the Transvaal and Orange River Colony the franchise was restricted to white men; in Natal a native could obtain a vote, but under conditions which made this very difficult; in Cape Colony any native could do so who has a certain property qualification and can write his name.]

Pretoria is the capital and seat of government of the Union. Cape Town is the seat of the Legislature.

The first Parliamentary Election under the South Africa Act was held on the 15th September, 1910, and the Union was inaugurated by H.R.H. The Duke of Connaught, K.G.

Provinces.

A Provincial Council in each province has power to legislate by ordinance on certain subjects specified in the Act, and on such other subjects as may be delegated to it. The specified subjects include direct taxation for provincial purposes, the borrowing of money on the credit of the province, primary education (for five years), agriculture, hospitals, municipal institutions, local works other than railways and harbours, roads, markets, game preservation and other purely local or private matters. All ordinances passed by a Provincial Council are subject to the veto of the Governor-General in Council. Members of the Provincial Council are elected on the same system as members of Parliament, but the restriction as to European descent does not apply. The number of members in each Provincial Council is as follows:

- Cape of Good Hope ... ... ... 51
- Natal ... ... ... ... ... 25
- Transvaal ... ... ... ... ... 36
- Orange Free State ... ... ... ... 25

The first Provincial elections for the Cape of Good Hope and the Transvaal were held on the 15th September, 1910; those for Natal and the Orange Free State on the 12th October, 1910.

The executive power in the subjects on which the Provincial Council is empowered to make ordinances is vested in an Executive Committee consisting of an Administrator, appointed by the Governor-General in Council, and four members elected by the Provincial Council.

Railways and Harbours Board.

The control and management of the railways and harbours, subject to the authority of the Governor-General in Council, are exercised through a Board consisting of a Minister of State as Chairman, and three Commissioners appointed by the Governor-General in Council.

The constitution of the Board on the 30th October 1910, was as follows:

- The Hon. Jacobus Wilhelmus Sauer, Minister of Railways and Harbours, Chairman.
- Sir Thomas Rees Price, K.C.M.G.
- Thomas Smith McEwen, Esq., A.M.I.C.E.
- Lt.-Col. Edward Mackenzie Greene, K.C.

Railways.

The South African Railways include the lines of the late Central South African Railways, the Cape Government Railways and Natal Government Railways. On the 31st August, 1910, the length of open lines in the four Provinces of the Union of South Africa, viz.:—Cape, Natal, Transvaal and Orange Free State, was 7,052 miles belonging to the Government, 680 miles owned by private companies, and a further 880 miles under construction.

The gross receipts of the railways of the Cape Colony, comprising 3,326 miles of open line, for the twelve months ended 31st December, 1909, amounted to £3,129,054, as compared with
2,850,139l. for the previous year. The working expenses for 1909 were 2,072,341l., and for 1908, 2,246,881l.; and the net result was a return of 3l. 5s. 6d. per cent. for the year on capital expended as compared with 1l. 17s. 8d. per cent. for the previous year. The gross receipts of the Central South African Railways, comprising 2,590 miles of open line, and including the Transvaal and Orange Free State systems, for the twelve months ended the 31st December, 1909, amounted to 5,064,421l., as against 4,218,297l. in 1908. The expenditure for 1909 was 2,232,667l. as compared with 2,420,540l. for 1908. The gross receipts of the Natal Government Railways, comprising 988 miles open for traffic, for the twelve months ended the 31st December, 1909, amounted to 2,024,657l. as compared with 1,832,862l. for 1908, and the expenditure was 1,187,038l. as compared with 1,240,319l.

The Government issues tariff books, corrected periodically, containing full information upon all matters of interest or likely to be of service to the public, such as fares, rates, distances, running of trains, etc.

Harbours.

Harbour works on an extensive scale have been constructed at Table Bay (Cape Town), Port Elizabeth, and East London. These ports are now under the direct control of the Railways and Harbours Board.

The expenditure upon construction of works at Table Bay to the 31st December, 1908, has been 4,214,822l., and the annual charges for interest and maintenance, including working, are respectively about 114,027l. and 174,422l.

The shipping accommodation consists of an outer harbour, formed in part by the breakwater, and a south arm running parallel with it, enclosing an area of 64 acres, which, with the inner basin, makes a total area of 72½ acres, with a depth ranging from 20 to 35 feet at low water.

Many of the quays are equipped with the most modern appliances for handling cargo, such as electric cranes and capstans; and commodious warehouses are erected in various parts of the dock, having a total covered storage capacity of 468,516 square feet. The normal capacity of the docks is 8,000 tons per diem.

The breakwater is completed to a length of 3,640 feet, and affords protection to vessels anchored in the bay.

The graving dock is 500 feet on the keel blocks, with a depth of 24½ feet over the sill at entrance at H.W.O.S.T., and a slip is available for vessels up to 500 tons.

The works at Port Elizabeth consist of two jetties, 1,160 feet long, which cost 260,000l., and a third jetty, 1,460 feet in length, which cost 185,000l.

In addition to the above, there is an explosives jetty, 1,380 feet from the shore, with an aerial ropeway communication. This ropeway is capable of landing 150 tons per day.

There is also a slipway capable of accommodating vessels of 400 tons dead weight.

The harbour yards and warehouses are illuminated with electric current supplied from the municipal works. One 10-ton and two 5-ton overhead gantries, and the machinery in the workshops, are operated by electric current obtained from the same source.

The port's hydraulic plant consists of three pumping engines each of 200 horse-power, working 29 wharf cranes, 12 capstans, and 4 wool hoists.

The total area of the Board's warehouses is about 35,000 square yards.

At East London, at the mouth of the Buffalo River, successful harbour works have been carried out, overcoming the obstruction of sand-bars, which previously to a great extent closed the mouth of the river. The entrance to the river is now protected and sheltered by a solid south breakwater and improved by means of two training walls. The depth of water about the entrance is maintained by three steam pump-hopper dredgers of the latest type. A least depth of water over the bar of about 19 feet at low water ordinary spring tides is available throughout the year. The width between training walls at entrance to river is 250 feet. Steamers of over 8,000 tons gross register now enter the river and discharge cargo alongside wharves. The harbour is well equipped with steam, hydraulic and electric cranes, with a lifting capacity from 2½ up to 50 tons, and possesses a patent slip capable of accommodating vessels up to 1,000 tons dead weight. A new quay on the most up-to-date lines has been constructed on the west bank of the river, and will be found the most convenient quay in Africa. The whole of the arrangements on this side are in accordance with the best European models, and cargoes are landed and despatched with exceptional rapidity—goods being either loaded direct from the ship's hold on to railway trucks or deposited into very spacious sheds. The discharging appliances on this quay are operated by electricity, and are of the most modern design. To the 31st December, 1909, there had been spent on works, 2,084,407l.

At Durban the harbour is accessible at all times to the largest steamers navigating southern waters; and the entrance and harbour channels are equipped with leading lights and light buoys, night navigation being an ordinary feature of the port work. Pilotage is compulsory. The harbour is approached through the Bluff Channel, 4,000 feet in length, formed by a north pier and a south breakwater. These works are 800 feet apart, except at the pier heads, where the breadth is only 600 feet. The average low-water depth at the entrance is 34 feet, and in the harbour channels 30 feet. Rise of tide: springs, 6 feet; neaps, 3½ feet. The land-locked bay inside these piers extends about 3½ miles east and west, and nearly two miles north and south. The deep-water space available for shipping covers about one-fifth of the area, and gives a low-water depth of not less than 30 feet over its greater part. This area is being constantly extended by dredging. There is a total of 10,370 feet of concrete quay, and wooden wharf and jetty berthing, giving a low-water depth alongside of from 21 to 34 feet, and the concrete quay is presently being extended to provide 38 feet berthing.

Port Equipment.—Craneage: One 50-ton, one 10-ton, thirty 3-ton, four 30-cwt. hydraulic cranes, and two 3-ton steam cranes. Electric cranes are on order for quay under construction. Nine wharf sheds of 30,000 tons capacity. One McMyler dumper and two transporters (worked by electricity) for loading coal at rate of 400 to 500 tons per hour. An extensive section of the foreshore has been, and is being, reclaimed and provided with wharfage, and the immediate hinterland leased to manufacturers. Up to the present 50 acres of this land have been reclaimed and are in use. The capacity of the port is 8,000 tons daily, exclusive of coal. The railway is laid on all
wharves and quays. The whole is lit by electricity, and an inexhaustible water supply serves all berthage. It will thus be seen that in the working of the shipping, the landing and shipping of goods, the loading or bunkering of coal, and in every possible sense, Durban Harbour is equipped to give despatch at a minimum cost.

The chief exports are maize, sugar, tea, wattle bark, wool, hides, skins, horns, mohair, and coal. 1909 imports, 548,777 tons; exports, 261,412 tons; coal shipped and bunkered, 1,239,318 tons.

Other equipment: Three powerful tugs; floating dock, 475 feet in length, over platforms to take a 23-feet draught and a dead-weight of 8,500 tons; floating workshopequipped with a 15-ton crane is an appendage to the floating dock; and a patent slip for small craft of 250 tons dead-weight.

Fifty million tons of spoil have been dredged from the Bay since 1884. The harbour debt at 30th June, 1910, amounted to 3,893,766l., and the annual charge for interest and maintenance, exclusive of working, are respectively about 136,000l. and 27,000l.

Customs.

The four self-governing Colonies prior to the operation of the Act of Union gave notice to the Administrations of Southern and North-Western Rhodesia of their intention to retire from the South African Customs Union Convention in terms of Article xxiii. of that Convention, with effect from 30th June, 1910; and subsequently, on the consummation of the Union of South Africa, an agreement was concluded with these Administrations to continue all the essential features of the previous Customs Convention, viz.:

(a) The free interchange of the produce and manufactures of the Provinces of the Union, and the Territories of Southern and North-Western Rhodesia, excepting spirits and beers, upon which duties not exceeding certain rates can be imposed;

(b) The collection by and payment to the Administrations, and vice versa, of the duties imposed by the late Convention Tariff on goods intended for consumption in the said Territories, or vice versa, subject to a collecting charge of 5 per cent.; and

(c) The payment to the Administrations, and vice versa, of 95 per cent. of the duty collected on imported materials which are contained to an appreciable extent in Union manufactures, and vice versa, entered for removal to the Territories of Southern and North-Western Rhodesia, or to the Union of South Africa, as the case may be.

The Agreement continues in force until the 30th of June, 1911, and thereafter for periods of twelve months, subject to three months' notice by either party of its intention to retire therefrom as from the 30th June following such notice. If, however, either party amend the Customs Tariff, or take any steps in conflict with the spirit and intent of this Agreement, the other is at liberty to retire forthwith.

For like reasons, a Customs Agreement has been entered into between the Government of the Union and His Majesty's High Commissioner on behalf of the Territories of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Basutoland, and Swaziland. The agreement is in all essentials identical to that referred to above, except that instead of a collecting charge of 5 per cent. on all duties collected, and the payment of 95 per cent. of any duty collected on imported materials contained in Union manufactures, the basis laid down in Section No. 12 of the South Africa Act, 1909, for the adjustment of duties between the parties to the Agreement is followed, viz.: The Treasury of the Union will pay out quarterly a sum in respect of such duties which shall bear to the total Customs revenue of the Union in each year the same proportion as the average amount of the Customs revenue of such Territories for the three completed financial years last preceding the taking effect of the South Africa Act, 1909.

The Transvaal Province continues, under the terms of the Transvaal-Mozambique Convention, to admit the products and manufactures of the Province of Mozambique, except spirits, free of duty, but such products and manufactures are liable to the Union import duty if removed to another Province in the Union or to Southern or North-Western Rhodesia, or to the Territories of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Basutoland, and Swaziland.

Pending legislation in respect of the Excise duties in force in the several Provinces of the Union, Customs duties, equivalent to the excise rates in force in any Province of the Union, are levied on Union distilled spirits imported therein. Again, in the Province of the Cape of Good Hope, a surtax is levied on the consumption of imported spirits, cigarettes, and imported patent or proprietary medicines; and an equivalent excise is levied by means of stamps on cigarettes, and patent and proprietary medicines manufactured in the Union or in Southern or North-Western Rhodesia, or in the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Basutoland, and Swaziland, when entered for consumption in the Cape Province.

The principle of granting a rebate of duties on all goods the growth or manufacture of the United Kingdom is maintained; likewise of granting such rebate of duties to those British Colonies and Possessions which grant an equivalent rebate to the products and manufactures of the Union of South Africa.

All duties are rebated on goods in transit through any part of the Union to places outside the Union.

Education.

In the South Africa Act, sec. 85 (iii.), it is provided that "Education, other than higher education, for a period of five years and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides," shall be and remain under the jurisdiction of the respective Provincial Councils.

For practical purposes it has been provisionally determined that all post-matriculation instruction shall be deemed to constitute higher education.

The Department of Education, under the Minister, is therefore concerned with:

CAPE OF GOOD HOPE PROVINCE.

Extent and Boundaries.

The Cape of Good Hope, strictly speaking, is a
small promontory near the south-west extremity of
the continent of Africa. But the extensive Province
of the name is bounded by the Atlantic and the
Southern or Indian Oceans on the west and
south; it is bounded on the north to the west of
longitude 22° by the Orange River, and on the
north-east by the Orange Free State and Natal
Provinces. The Cape Province, with the Transkei,
contains an area of 276,995 square miles, being
over five times that of England. It extends from
26 to 38 deg. S. lat., and from 17 to 30 deg. E.
long.

In 1844 Letters Patent were issued annexing
Natal to the Cape, but in 1856 it was constituted
a separate Colony.

Twelve islands off Angra Pequena, on the coast
of Damaraland (Plum-pudding, Roast-beef, Hol-
lam's Bird, Mercury, Ichaboe, Seal, Penguin,
Halifax, Long, Possession, Albatross, and Mona), with the adjacent rocks, were annexed in 1867, and added to the Cape Colony in 1874.

In 1876, three large tracts of Kaffraria—namely, Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve, and Noman's Land, were brought under the more direct control of Government, and on the 12th of June, 1876, Letters Patent were issued authorising the Governor to annex these territories to the Cape of Good Hope, on condition of the Cape Parliament passing an Act to provide for their government. Such an Act was passed as No. 38 of 1877, but the territories were not actually incorporated until the 1st of October, 1879.

On the 12th March, 1878, the Port of Walfish Bay, situated a few miles north of the tropic of Capricorn, was proclaimed British territory. It was annexed to the Colony by proclamation dated 7th August, 1884.

On the 15th October, 1880, the Province of Griqualand West was incorporated with the Cape Colony.

Under Proclamation No. 13 of the 26th January, 1882, were issued certain laws and regulations for the government of the territories known respectively as Tembuland, Emigrant Tambookieland, Bomvanaland, and Gealekaland, of which, by royal warrant dated the 14th November, 1881, the officer administering the government of the Cape of Good Hope was appointed Governor. By proclamation No. 140 of 26th August, 1885, issued under Act 3 of 1885, these territories were annexed to the Cape Colony. A similar warrant was passed on the 27th July, 1881, in respect to the St. John's River Territory, which was annexed to the Colony by Proclamation No. 215 of the 15th September, 1884.

The Xesibe country ("Mount Ayliff") was annexed to the Colony by Letters Patent of the 23rd August and Proclamation of 25th October, 1886, and the Rode Valley, Pondoland, by Letters Patent of 29th July, 1887, and Proclamation of October, 1887 (Act No. 45 of 1887). Under Act No. 5 of 1894 the whole of Pondoland was annexed. Basutoland, now an independent Colony, formed part of the Cape from 1871 to 1884.

On the 16th of November, 1895, British Bechuanaland was incorporated with the Cape under Law No. 41 of 1895.

History.

On 14th September, 1486, Bartholomew de Diaz, a Portuguese commander, landed in Algoa Bay. Vasco de Gama doubled the Cape 11 years later, from which time it appears to have been resorted to by European navigators of all nations, but chiefly by Portuguese, Dutch, and English. British ships visited the Cape in 1591, and about 1602 the Dutch made it a place of call. In 1620 two English East India commanders, by a proclamation dated from Saldanha Bay, took possession of the Cape in the name of Great Britain; but no settlement was formed. In 1648 a Dutch East Indiaman, the Haarlem, was wrecked in Table Bay, the crew remaining there some time. In 1652 J. A. Van Riebeck, duly commissioned by the "Chamber of Seventeen" at Amsterdam, landed at Table Bay accompanied by 100 persons, and took possession of what is now the site of Cape Town on behalf of the Dutch East India Company. In 1671 the first formal purchase of land was made from the Hottentots, and another purchase took place the following year. At the time of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the European population received a slight addition of French Protestants, but their descendants have not maintained any distinctive position in the country. The rule of the Dutch East India Company proved very distasteful to the burghers, who were continually prompted to move further and further from the seaboard and original seat of colonisation. Following these migratory colonists, a magistracy was established at Swellendam in 1745, and another at Graaff Reinet in 1786, and in 1788 the Great Fish River was proclaimed the boundary of the Colony. In 1795, Holland having yielded to the French Revolutionary Government, an English force proceeded to the Cape of Good Hope to secure it against the French for the Prince of Orange, but the Governor refused to obey the mandate of the Prince, and the British force thereupon proceeded to take possession, upon which a capitulation was arranged, and the administration of the Government was assumed by General Craig. An Act of Parliament (37 Geo. III., c. II.) was passed to regulate the trade with the new possession. By the Peace of Amiens the Cape of Good Hope was restored to the Batavian Republic, and evacuated in 1803, but it was again captured by a British Force in 1806, and at the General Peace of 1814 it was ceded in perpetuity to the British Crown. During the interval between the Peace of Amiens and the recapture by the British in 1806, the Colony had made rapid progress, owing to the abolition of the rule of the Dutch East India Company, and the wise regulations of government which had been substituted. An important event in the history of the Cape was the expulsion in 1809 of the Kaffirs from the Zuurveldt, a district west of the Great Fish River. In 1817 that district was visited by the then Governor, who saw the importance of its colonisation as a barrier against the Kaffir power, and in 1820 Parliament voted a sum of 50,000l. to promote emigration to the Cape, and 4,000 British immigrants were brought to the Colony and settled in the eastern districts. In December, 1834, began the first of what are called the Kaffir wars, when the Gaika tribe, 20,000 strong, overran the whole south-eastern portion of the Colony, but were defeated, and their lands up to the Kei River proclaimed British territory, but Lord Glenelg, then Secretary of State, refused to ratify the annexation. In 1846 the second Kaffir war broke out, but was speedily suppressed, and the colonial border was extended to the Kei River, as proposed by Sir Benjamin D'Urban. On Christmas Day, 1850, began the third Kaffir war, which lasted nearly three years, and in its earlier stages was aggravated by a simultaneous rebellion of the Kat River Hottentots.

In 1836 began what is called the trekking of a part of the Dutch or Boer population. This remarkable movement, which resulted in the colonisation of Natal, the Free State, and the Transvaal, may be ascribed to several causes, of which the chief were: (1.) General dislike of the policy of Great Britain in relation to slavery and the Native question. (2.) Particular resentment against the policy of Lord Glenelg in reversing the policy of Sir Benjamin D'Urban in relation to the first Kaffir war. (3.) Resentment against the mode in which compensation had been made to them for the loss of their slaves under the Imperial Act abolishing slavery, namely, by orders for payment payable in London, which they could only dispose of on the spot at an enormous discount.

The years 1849 and 1850 were years of continued excitement, owing to the proposals of the Government at home to send convicts to the Cape.
In view of the agitation, carried almost to the point of active resistance, the project was abandoned. In 1856 the German Legion, which had been formed during the Crimean war, was brought to the Cape, and the men, numbering 2,300, disposed in selected spots on the frontier for defensive purposes. The same year (1856) was remarkable for the prevalence in Native Kaffraria of a cattle-killing delusion, preached by a young prophetess, which resulted in wide-spread starvation. The political changes which have occurred in recent years are briefly described under the title Constitution. One of the most important events in the recent economical and social history of the Cape has been the discovery of diamonds beyond the Orange River, which is described under the title of Diamonds.

Climate.

The climate of the Cape is very favourable to Europeans. The air is dry and bracing, the heat seldom oppressive, and the winter weather mild and delightful; snow or ice is practically unknown except in the more elevated localities. The mean annual temperature at the Royal Observatory, near Cape Town, is 62°2 deg., the mean maximum being 70°8 deg., and the mean minimum 53°5 deg.; the average rainfall for the last 69 years is 25°65 inches. Aliwal North (4,330 ft. above sea level) shows a mean temperature of 59°2 deg., the mean maximum being 74°2 deg., and the mean minimum 44°1 deg.; the rainfall average of 41 years being 24°12 inches. At the Royal Observatory the warmest days occur in February, when the average maximum is 80°0 deg. F., and the coldest nights in July, with an average minimum of 46°7 deg. F.; at Aliwal North January is the warmest month, the day temperature averaging 84°3 deg., whereas in July, when the coldest nights are experienced, the mean average minimum is only 28°6 deg. F.

In the Eastern and Midland divisions the chief rainfall is during the summer months (November to April), in the Western districts during the winter months, while along the South Coast the rainfall is fairly uniformly distributed throughout the twelve months.

The Cape offers many localities presenting the requisites of altitude and extreme dryness for the modern treatment of consumptive patients.

Population and Chief Towns.

At the census of 1904 the total population of the Colony was found to be 2,409,804, comprising 1,218,940 males, and 1,190,864 females. The population according to race was: Europeans, 579,741; Malays, 15,682; Hottentots, 91,260; Fingos, 310,720; Kaffirs, 1,114,067; and other coloured persons, 298,334.

Cape Town, which had in 1891 a population of 51,251, had at the census a population of 77,668, and with its suburbs, connected by rail and tramway, 169,641, as compared with 78,866 in 1891. The Cape division, which includes Cape Town, had, in 1865, a population of 50,064; in 1875, 57,319; in 1891, 97,283; and, in 1904, 213,167, of which 120,475 were European or white.

The population of the other principal towns was: Kimberley, 34,331; Port Elizabeth, 32,959; Beaconsfeld, 9,378; Grahamstown, 13,887; Paarl, 11,293; King William’s Town, 9,506; East London, 25,220; Graaff Reinet, 10,083; Worcester, 7,885; Uitenhage, 12,193; Cradock, 7,762; Oudtshoorn, 8,849; Queenstown, 9,616; Stellenbosch, 4,969; and Somerset East, 5,216.

The following is a brief abstract of the 1904 census returns:

The number of persons of European descent has been estimated as follows:—Dutch and French origin, 230,000; English, Scotch, Irish, etc., 130,000; other Europeans, 16,000.

The European, or white, then, represents one-quarter, and the coloured races three-quarters of the total population of the whole Colony, whereof one-fifth is urban. The proportion of females is now 97·70 to every 100 males of the total population, and the average number of persons to the square mile was 8·70. The number of inhabited dwellings was 455,999, of which 434 were not intended for dwelling-houses, though used as such.

Estimated Population, 1907.—The number of persons on the 31st December, 1907, is estimated at 2,507,500, made up as follows:—European or white, 610,680; other than European or white, 1,896,820.

Birthplaces.—2,274,130 persons had Africa for a birthplace, 118,377 Europe, 10,387 Asia, 3,011 America, 3,654 Australasia, 118 were born at sea, and the birthplaces of 127 were unknown or unspecified. 98·38 per cent. of the population are British subjects by birth.

Religions.—Protestants numbered 1,305,453; Catholics, 38,118; Jews, 19,537; Mohammedans, 22,623; other sects, 4,297; no religion, 1,016,255; unspecified, 3,286; and 235 persons objected to state their religion. Protestants may be divided as follows:—Dutch Reformed Church, 399,487; Gereformeerde Kerk, 6,209; English Church, 281,433; Presbyterians, 88,660; Congregationalists, 112,202; Methodists, 290,264; Lutherans, 80,902; Baptists, 14,105; other Protestants, 32,191.

The population of Bechuanaland, as ascertained at the census of 1904, was: Europeans, 9,365; Malays, 28; Hottentots, 3,331; Fingoes, 1,265; Kaffirs and Bechuana, 64,204; mixed and others, 6,276.

The population of Pondoland at the Census of 1904 was 1,113 Europeans, 3 Malays, 130 Hottentots, 13,067 Fingoes, 187,442 Kaffirs and Bechuana, and 1,002 mixed and others.

In the Colony proper the European birth rate in 1904 was computed to be 31.81 per 1,000, the Coloured rate at 30.77. The death rate amongst Europeans was 12.61 per 1,000, and the Coloured rate 25.42, during the same year.

**Constitution.**

The Government of the Cape from 1806 to 1835 was administered by a Governor, aided by a few Executive Officers; but in that year an Executive Council and a Legislative Council, appointed by the Crown, comprising certain office-holders and some unofficial members, were created.

By Letters Patent, dated 23rd May, 1850, the Governor and Council were empowered to enact Ordinances for the establishment of a Representative Government; three years later, that form of Government was brought into force. By an Act of the Colonial Legislature passed in the session of 1872, the introduction of the system of Responsible Government, that is the conduct of the Executive Government by the advice of Ministers responsible to the Local Parliament, was pronounced advisable, and the Royal Assent to the measure was given by an Order in Council dated the 9th August, 1872. The first Ministry under Responsible Government was formed in November, 1872.

On the 31st May, 1910, the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope became one of the four Provinces of the Union of South Africa. The Province is subject to the Parliament of the Union, but the control of certain matters of a provincial character is vested in an Administrator and Provincial Council.

Cape Town is the seat of Provincial Government.

For the purpose of the House of Assembly elections for the Parliament of the Union, the Province of the Cape of Good Hope is divided into 51 electoral divisions each returning one member. Members are elected by voters who are qualified (see Ballot and Franchise Act, No. 9 of 1892, Cape) by possession of property worth £5l., or receipt of salary or wages of not less than 50l. per annum, but no one can be duly registered as a voter unless he can sign his name and write his address and occupation, and is a British subject by birth or naturalization. The number of registered electors in 1909 in the Province of the Cape of Good Hope was 142,367. The Registration Act, No. 14 of 1887, makes a better provision for the machinery of registration and for the exclusion of unqualified persons, especially those whose only qualification is a share in tribal occupancy, and further provision in the direction of improved machinery is made in the Parliamentary Representation Act, No. 19 of 1898, the Registration of Parliamentary Voters Amendment Act, No. 48 of 1899, the Parliamentary Indemnity Act, No. 5 of 1902, and in the Parliamentary Elections Act, No. 6 of 1908.

Elections are conducted under the Ballot Act, No. 9 of 1892, as amended by Acts No. 48 of 1899 and No. 6 of 1908.

The Provincial Council of the Province consists of the same number of members (51) as are elected in the Province for the House of Assembly, and they are elected by the persons qualified to vote for the election of members of the House of Assembly in the Province voting in the same electoral divisions. The procedure relating to the conduct of elections is similar to that of the House of Assembly.

**Local Government.**

Divisional Councils were first established in the year 1835; they then exercised authority over branch roads only, and performed certain functions in connection with district schools, pounds and Crown lands. They have now been relieved of all duties in regard to schools and lands, but with these exceptions their powers and functions have been gradually increased and amplified. The councils are elected triennially, and consist of six to eight elective members, exclusive of the Civil Commissioner, who is usually also Resident Magistrate, as chairman, excepting in the Cape Division, which returns fourteen members. The electors are the owners or occupiers of immovable property, and the qualifications of members are registration as voters and registered ownership of immovable property in the division valued at not less than £500. The maintenance of all roads now rests with the councils, and they also have important duties to discharge in regard to disputed land boundaries and beacons; can nominate Field Cornets; may borrow money on the security of rates for the prosecution of local public works; and return three members annually to the District Licensing Court. The revenue of these councils is derived from toll fees, pound sales, and road rates. They were 80 in number in 1909, and their receipts during the year amounted to £365,997. Payments for the same period amounted to £348,427. The accounts are subject to audit by two auditors elected triennially by the registered voters of the division, and also to a final audit by the Controller and Auditor-General of the Colony.

Municipalities were first established by an Ordinance in 1836. In 1882 an Act was passed consolidating and amending all laws then existing in regard to these boards. Every municipality is governed by a council, composed of a mayor or chairman, and councillors, numbering not less than 6 nor more than 24, a certain number of whom are elected annually by the ratepayers. Certain municipalities are under special Acts, but all Town Councils or municipalities under the General Municipal Act, 1882, have power to levy annually a landlord's or owner's rate, assessed upon the value of rateable property, and a tenant's rate assessed upon the annual value of such property; no rate to exceed 2d. in the £ on the value, or 8d. in the £ on the annual value.

All mayors or chairmen are members of District Licensing Courts. There are 121 municipalities in the Province, the receipts from all sources during the year 1909 amounted to £1,164,712. The amount of loans outstanding, 31st December, 1909 (excluding bank overdrafts), was £6,478,874., and the assessed rateable value of fixed property was £54,866,101. Payments during the same period amounted to £1,228,253. The Controller and Auditor-General has no general control over municipal accounts.

Village management boards, of which there are 87 in the Colony, exist chiefly in hamlets which are not entrusted with full municipal privileges. The Act of 1881, under which these boards were established, may be proclaimed to be in force upon
petition of the inhabitants. There are 3 or 5 members elected annually by the voters registered for Parliamentary purposes, resident within the area defined by proclamation. These boards have no power to levy rates; this is done for them by the divisional council at their request, to an amount not exceeding 3d. in the £ within the limits of the village boards' jurisdiction. The powers and duties of these boards are of the same nature as, although in most respects more restricted than, those of municipalities. Their revenues amounted in 1908-9 to 12,753l. 2s., excluding balances.

**Industries.**

The chief industries are the production of wool, mohair, brandy, wine, wheat, barley, oats, tobacco, fruit, lucerne and maize, and the breeding of horses, mules, cattle, goats, sheep and ostriches. The chief exports are diamonds, wool, copper ore, ostrich feathers, mohair, hides and skins. The chief imports are hardware and machinery, wearing apparel of all descriptions, and material therefor, sugar, coffee, other foodstuffs, timber (including manufactured articles), oils, tobacco, and wines and spirits.

The quantity of wine produced in the Colony during 1904, the census year, amounted to 5,686,672 gallons, spirits, to 1,534,069½ gallons, and vinegar to 113,862½ gallons, practically all consumed locally. In 1909 there were produced 3,467,354 gallons of wine, and 669,798 gallons of brandy.

Ostrich breeding is carried on largely as heretofore, but farmers are now devoting more attention to the quality of the feathers in their breeding birds than in former years.

In 1860 the export of ostrich feathers was 2,287 lbs.; ten years later it was 28,768 lbs., while in 1909 it amounted to 792,725 lbs., valued at 2,098,085l.

The exports of mohair at corresponding dates were respectively:—385 lbs., 403,153 lbs., 18,332,093 lbs., valued at 809,443l. The export of wool had risen from 23,172,785 lbs. in 1860, to 48,822,562 lbs. in 1871. In 1909 the export was 102,346,698 lbs., valued at 2,854,835l.

The export of wool and mohair, though showing for 1904 and 1905 a marked decrease on that of 1902, due to the drought which for a few years prevailed in the greater portion of the Colony, increased in 1906. The high price of slaughter stock has induced the farmers to turn their attention more to cross-breeding for the production of mutton, and this also has had some influence in the decreased export of wool. The tendency is, however, again in favour of breeding pure-woollen sheep.

The movement in the direction of grading and sorting of wool is gradually becoming general throughout the Colony. Every effort is being made to foster this movement, and the Government have arranged for expert demonstrations throughout the Colony, and sanguine hopes are entertained of successful results. Among other measures for the amelioration of the agricultural industries of the country, co-operation has begun to play a part, and efforts are being put forward to induce farmers to combine and organise their forces in developing both the production and the subsequent advantageous disposal of their produce.

The above undertakings are carried out under the direct supervision of the Department of Agriculture, which is also charged with the control of all matters connected with animal industry and diseases, diseases of plants, the suppression of insect pests, viticulture, horticulture, and all other subjects allied with agriculture. Among the other important works being carried out are the investigation of agricultural conditions by means of experiment stations and plots, the distribution of new varieties of seeds, etc., to farmers for experimental purposes and the diffusion of agricultural knowledge among the farming community by means of the publications of the department as well as by lectures and demonstrations by its various experts. A well-equipped Agricultural College exists at Elsenburg in the Stellenbosch division.

Large areas of the Colony are peculiarly adapted for the breeding of mules as the nature of the veld renders any other feeding unnecessary. The industry has been largely taken up in these areas and many farmers are importing jackasses for this purpose. In horse-breeding also there has been renewed activity, the practice of former years, viz., crossing the Colonial mares with English thoroughbred stallions, having been largely reverted to, and, on account of the large importation of racing stock, there is no lack of suitable sires in the country.

**Guano Industry.**

The Guano Islands, some 30 in number, comprise all the principal islands, islets and rocks situated along and around the Western and Southern portions of the South African Coast, lying between latitude 24° 30' South, and longitude 26° 30' East.

These Islands were formerly leased to and worked by private individuals, but were subsequently, by resolution of the Cape Colonial House of Assembly, dated 2nd July, 1889, taken over, as the several leases fell in, and worked for the Colonial Government by an Agent specially appointed for the purpose.

On 1st July, 1898, the Guano business was converted into a Government undertaking, as a Sub-Department of the Agricultural Department, and placed under the sole control and management of an expert officer, designated the Superintendent, and is still being run on the same lines.

The islands are worked principally for the production of guano, but other bye-products such as penguin eggs, seal skins, seal oil, etc., are also obtained from them.

The average yield of guano from all sources for the last three years has been 6,500 tons per annum, and this is steadily increasing.

As all the guano collected is reserved for sale to farmers in the several Provinces in the Union only, no exportation of this fertilizer to places over-sea is permitted.

The Guano is used principally by the farming community in the cultivation of all cereals and vegetables, and the demand for it, which is also steadily increasing, is now very nearly equal to the season's output.

With the object of assisting farmers in procuring a first-class fertilizer, at a very reasonable rate, all collections of Guano are systematically mixed so as to obtain an approximately uniform grade of article and the mixture is sold at a price fixed by the Government, viz., 6½ per ton, which is very much below its commercial value.

The collection of penguin eggs is restricted to a few islands only, lying within easy distance of Cape Town, and the number collected annually...
is from 600,000 to 650,000. These eggs form a cheap article of food, and are much sought after by certain classes of the community. Their sale is undertaken by a Government contractor, by whom they are distributed to and disposed of in all centres throughout the Provinces of the Union.

The number of seal skins and the quantity of oil secured annually varies very considerably, according to circumstances, as a portion of this industry has been thrown open to private enterprise.

The average number of skins taken during the last three years was 3,450 per annum, but considerably more than 8,000 have been captured in previous years. These skins are shipped to England and sold by auction on the London markets, and fetch very good prices.

From 1,500 to 2,000 gallons of seal oil is secured annually, which is all sold locally.

Lands.

Those desiring to acquire Crown Lands in the Cape Colony must now either compete at public auction at the sales of surveyed lands held under Act 15 of 1887 from time to time as occasion seems to demand in the various districts of the Colony, or they must apply for certain specified areas or farms which have been set aside for selection under Act 37 of 1882 or Act 40 of 1895.

Both these Acts were designed to enable sons of the soil without means, such as the sons of farmers, to obtain land without necessitating the investment of capital, and they require the applicant to select and name the piece of ground he requires; and if his request be entertained, a licence for five years is issued at a rental calculated at 5 per cent. on the capitalised assessed value of the land. Upon the termination of the licence and fulfilment of the conditions respecting occupation and (in the case of Act 37 of 1882) cultivation, the licensee is entitled to a title deed under Act 37 of 1882 on quit-rent tenure, and, under Act 40 of 1895, on payment of the purchase price in instalments extending over 15 years, the balance of unpaid instalments and the survey expenses being secured by a mortgage in favour of the Government.

Act 37 of 1882 deals with small holdings, not larger than 250 morgen, and is suitable for districts in the vicinity of markets where la petite culture may be carried on profitably, but Act 40 of 1895 is rather applicable to cattle or sheep runs of 3,000 to 6,000 morgen in extent, and is most suitable for pastoral districts.

Under Act 15 of 1887, farms in extent varying from the cattle ranch to the market garden or town building lot are surveyed by the Government, and advertised for sale from time to time to the highest bidder at an upset price. The price is assessed at the current market value in the district, and is of course subject to enhancement by competition, but the terms of payment are very easy, one-fifth of the price at which the land is sold being payable within the first 12 months—viz., one-tenth within 6 months and one-tenth within 12 months, and the remainder being secured by a first mortgage at 4 per cent. The balance of the purchase price may, if the purchaser desires it, be paid at once, or in portions of not less than £50 at a time. In case, however, the purchase price is less than £25 the whole amount must be paid in cash at once, or in equal instalments extending over 3 years, and bearing interest at 4 per cent. per annum from the date of sale.

Fisheries.

A properly-equipped steam trawler, the Pieter Faure, was imported in 1897 with a view to opening up the Fishing Industry of the Colony. The work was of a most satisfactory nature, the trials made proved that large quantities of fish are easily procurable by trawling. Private enterprise has followed the prospecting work of the Government, and the trawling industry is now firmly established. The trout acclimatisation work is still being carried on with a most gratifying measure of success, and several rivers have now been opened for public fishing.

Forests.

The total area reserved for forest purposes in the Province is approximately 665,000 morgen (1,400,000 acres). The attention of the Government has been given to the economical and systematic working of the Crown Forests. The Province is divided into four Conservancies, each controlled by a Conservator of Forests stationed at Cape Town, King William's Town, Knysna and Umtata respectively, who is directly responsible to the Chief Conservator of Forests for the Union. The present annual importation of timber into the Province is about 2,000,000 cubic feet, mostly pine, derived from Europe and America, the balance being hardwood from Australia. There is at present a large importation of hardwood sleepers. Expenditure on Forests for year 1909, £53,548; Revenue, £37,610.

Diamonds.

The diamond fields of South Africa are situated in the territory known as Griqualand West, which became British territory by cession from the Griqua people in 1871, and remained a separate Colony until October, 1880, when it was annexed to the Cape Colony.

The first diamond was found by accident in 1867, and passed through many hands before its value was suspected.

In the year 1870 an exploring party, chiefly composed of officers of the 20th Regiment, then stationed in Natal, and another of Cape Colonists from King William's Town, proceeded to dig and wash the alluvial drift along the banks of the Vaal River. They soon found diamonds, and their success brought numerous other parties from all parts of the neighbouring Colonies and Republics. Operations were at this time confined to the river banks, which for many miles were covered with mining camps.

In 1871 the discovery was made that diamonds existed not only in the drift of the old river-bed near the present course of the Vaal, but in the loose red surface-sand covering the flat grassy country between that river and the Modder, a smaller stream which ultimately joins the Vaal. A vigorous, if not systematic, search soon resulted in the opening of the mines now being worked at and close to Kimberley, and the river banks were soon almost deserted for the more profitable Dry Diggings, where diamonds were found in unexampled profusion.

Owing to the depression in the diamond market the only Dry Mines at present being worked are Kimberley, Bultfontein and Wesselton in the Division of Kimberley, and a part of Smith's Prospect Mine, in the Division of Barkly West.
In October, 1899, an Act was promulgated (No. 11 of 1899) to consolidate and amend the laws relating to the prospecting and mining for precious stones in the Colony. This has been amended by Act No. 27 of 1907.

The following table gives the total quantity and value of the export of diamonds during the past five years:

| Year | Carats | Value |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1905 | 2,335,646 | £4,860,659 |
| 1906 | 6,279,572 | £6,834,369 |
| 1907 | 2,491,496 | £5,978,531 |
| 1908 | 1,645,401 | £3,191,682 |
| 1909 | 4,943,058 | £6,370,301 |

**Coal.**

Cape coal from various mines situated in the Stormberg is extensively used by the South African railways with good results, both as regards the working of the lines and the development of an industry.

During the year 1897 a series of thorough comparative tests was made by the Railway Department of all coals (Welsh, Cape Colonial, Orange Free State and Transvaal) used by the Cape Locomotive Department. Of the mines which supplied the different samples of coal thus tested, twelve are situated in Cape Colony. The trials were carried out on the Eastern System of Railways between East London and Queenstown. The results obtained showed that the value of a given quantity of the best Cape coal, for use in locomotive or stationary engines, was, roughly speaking, about two-thirds that of an equal quantity of imported ocean Merthyr coal.

The total output from the Colonial mines during the year 1909 was at 103,281 tons. The coal areas in the Colony are of considerable extent, and there is reason to hope that, with increased facilities in mining and transport, the output will improve in quantity and quality.

**Copper.**

Mining operations on a large scale for copper are carried on in the division of Namaqualand, where extensive deposits exist.

The output from the mines in 1908 was 108,708 tons, and in 1909, 106,994 tons.

The laws regulating the working of baser minerals are Acts Nos. 9 of 1877 and 15 of 1883, under which regulations are published by G.N. 633 of 1900. These Acts are repealed by Act No. 16 of 1907, except in so far as they apply to existing baser mineral leases.

**Gold.**

The Millwood Gold Fields, in the Division of Knysna, the Spreeuwfontein Alluvial Diggings, in the Division of Prince Albert, and the Madibi Reef Digging, in the Division of Mafeking, are the only proclaimed gold fields in the Colony, and the total registered output to the 31st August, 1910, is 5,565 ozs. 17 dwt. 7 grs. In January, 1899, an Act (No. 31 of 1898) was promulgated to consolidate and amend the laws relating to the prospecting and mining for precious minerals in the Cape Colony, subsequently amended by Act 45 of 1905, and Act 16 of 1907.

**Geological Survey.**

The geological survey of the Colony was begun in 1896. The area mapped includes all that to the south-west of a line drawn from Van Rhyn's Dorp to Humansdorp, and very nearly the whole of the area north of the Orange River—e.g., Bechuanaland, Griqualand West, and part of Gordonia. South of the Orange River the survey has been carried down to De Aar and Carnarvon. There have also been mapped the divisions of Aliwal North, Barkly East, Herschel, Xlanga, Elliot, Glen Grey, Kentani, and portions of Wodehouse, Queenstown, Uitenhage, Alexandria, and Matatiele. Maps of some of these divisions have been published in the Reports for 1901 to 1907, but thirteen sheets of the geological map of Cape Colony on the scale of 1,600 cape roods (3½ miles) to the inch have been issued separately—e.g., three of the south-western districts and ten of the northern. Several other sheets are in course of publication.

**Sea and Land Communications.**

The packets of the Union-Castle Mail Steamship Company, under contract with the Colonial Government, leave England weekly on Saturdays, and the Cape (Table Bay) on Wednesdays, the passage to be effected in 16 days 15 hours, and in 17 days 9 hours when the steamer is required to touch at St. Helena and Ascension. The distance by sea from England to the Cape varies from 5,866 to 6,146 miles, according to the course followed. The mail packets call at Madeira on the outward and homeward voyages. The St. Helena-Ascension service is performed by the intermediate steamers of the company, under agreement with the Imperial post office.

Mail trains leave Cape Town daily, one at 11.30 a.m. for the Transvaal via Kimberley, and the other at 8.30 p.m. for the Midland and Eastern portions of the Cape Province, the Orange Free State, Transvaal and Natal. Return trains leave Pretoria daily, one at 9.45 a.m. via Kimberley, and the other at 7.45 p.m. via the Orange Free State, arriving at Cape Town at 7.15 a.m. and 6.0 p.m. respectively on the third day.

The 11.30 a.m. train from Cape Town is extended three times weekly to Vryburg, Mafeking and Bulawayo, and in addition the trains leaving on Tuesday and Friday connect at Kimberley with the "Zambesi Express," arriving at the Victoria Falls on Saturday and Wednesday. In the opposite direction the "Rhodesian Express" leaves Bulawayo on Sundays and Thursdays at 9.20 a.m., connecting at Kimberley with the ordinary train from the Transvaal, and arriving at Cape Town at 7.15 a.m. on Wednesday and Sunday. In addition an ordinary train leaves Bulawayo on Tuesday and Saturday at 10.15 a.m., arriving at Cape Town at 6.0 p.m. Friday and Tuesday.

On Tuesday and Saturday the "Transvaal Limited" train leaves Cape Town at 9.0 a.m. for Johannesburg and Pretoria, via Kimberley, and the return trains leave Pretoria at 5.40 p.m. on Thursday and Saturday, arriving at Cape Town on Saturday and Monday at 7.45 a.m.

On Thursdays the "Orange Limited" leaves Cape Town at 9.0 a.m. for the Transvaal via the Orange Free State.

In the opposite direction the Imperial Mail Train-de-Luxe runs via the Orange Free State, leaving Pretoria and Johannesburg on Monday evenings, reaching Cape Town on Wednesdays at 2.5 p.m., and going through to Cape Town Docks for the convenience of passengers for the mail steamer leaving for England on that day.
On Tuesdays a train conveying mails only is despatched from the docks to all parts of South Africa with the European mails brought by the incoming mail steamer.

Communication is effected between Cape Town and the chief inland towns daily; with the Orange Free State daily; with Natal daily, via the Orange Free State; with Rhodesia (Mashonaland, etc.) three times a week; and with the Transvaal twice daily by rail, viz., via Kimberley and Fourteen Streams, and, by another route, through the Orange Free State. The former is the direct route to the Transvaal, and the journey from Cape Town is performed in two days.

Overland communication is effected by rail between Cape Town and Lourenco Marques daily through the Orange Free State and the Transvaal. The journey is performed in 6½ hours.

The mail steamers leave Table Bay weekly for Natal, calling at Port Elizabeth and East London to land and embark passengers, while a weekly service to Port Elizabeth, East London, and Durban, and a fortnightly service to Mossel Bay, are also maintained by the intermediate steamers of the Union-Castle Company. The passage to Port Elizabeth takes two days, to East London three, and to Natal four to five.

A frequent service from Cape Town to the Australasian Colonies is maintained by the steamers of the Shaw, Savill, and Albion Company, the New Zealand Shipping Company, the Aberdeen Line, Lund's Blue Anchor Line, the White Star Line, and the German-Australian Steamship Company.

The number of Colonial post offices is 1,086, and of money order offices, 362. The expenditure on the postal service amounted to 468,305L. In 1909, the revenue was 473,250L., and the commission on money orders, 12,871L.

Post Office savings banks were established in 1884. On 31st December, 1909, there was a sum of 2,773,965L. deposited to the credit of 101,620 depositors. The interest allowed is 3 per cent. on deposits and 3½ per cent. on certificates. Savings bank business is transacted at all money order offices.

The telegraph system is well developed. There are 31,891 miles of telegraph wire, and 5,847 miles of telephone wire open, erected by the Government at a cost of 930,513L., the gross earnings in 1909 being 175,763L., and the expenditure 209,613L. Number of telegraph offices, 689.

The Cape Province is also in direct overland communication by telegraph with German South West Africa.

The Province is in telegraphic communication with Europe, via Loanda and Bathurst, and via St. Helena, Ascension, and St. Vincent by the Western route, and via Natal by the Zanzibar and Aden cable, and with Australia, India and the Far East, via Durban, Mauritius and Cocos.

The weights and measures in use are British; besides which there are the morgen=2½ acres, the Cape foot=1'03 feet, and the Cape ton =2,000 lbs.

Dependent Territories.

The Northern Border.—Early in 1878, while the war with the Amakosa was being carried on, a number of Koranas, Griquas, Kaffirs, and others living along the Orange River, took up arms against the Colony; their object being simply plunder. It was difficult to move a military force to such a remote quarter, and it was more than a year before the insurrection could be suppressed. A magistrate, with a body of police, was then stationed at Upington, on the northern bank of the Orange. Since this date there have been no further disturbances. The northern border establishment was broken up, and the Special Commissioner recalled, on 30th June, 1888. The territory now forms the "Gordonia" district of British Bechuanaland, now annexed to Cape Colony (see below).

Fingoland, Idutywa Reserve, and Noman's Land, as explained in Par. 1 of this Article, were annexed to the Cape in October, 1879.

In 1877 the Gcalekas, a tribe residing beyond the Kei, under Kreli, one of the leaders of the great Kaffir war of 1850-53, defied the authority of the British Government and invaded what is now British territory. They were, however, defeated by the Colonial forces under the immediate leadership of Col. C. D. Griffith, C.M.G., then Commandant of the Frontier Armed and Mounted Police. Their territory was overrun, and Kreli deposed, and his country taken by British in October, 1877.

In 1875-76 the Tembus, of Tembuland proper, gave themselves over to the Government, and in 1878 the Bomvanas did the same.

While giving effect to the desire of these tribes to come under the Cape Government, it was also arranged to include in the same scheme of incorporation Gcalekaland and a settlement of native British subjects called the Emigrant Tembus.

They are governed by officials paid by the Cape Government, and under its supervision.

The above-named territories, viz., Tembuland, Emigrant Tembuland, Bomvanaland, and Gcalekaland, were formally proclaimed British territory in November, 1881, and in 1885 they were annexed to the Cape Colony.

In 1885, the Chief Kreli requested to be placed on the same footing as the others, and was located in Bomvanaland, on a tract of land purchased from the Chief of the Bomvanas. Palir, chief of the Ametshezi, who had previously been living in practical independence in Lower Tembuland, formally tendered his submission to Colonial rule in 1886, and he and his people were registered in the same manner as the Tembus.

The PondoMisi tribe, under the chiefs Um-dithwa and Umhlonhlo, and some of the most powerful clans, allied with the Tembu tribe, took up arms against the Colony at the outbreak of the Basuto Rebellion. The Tembus proper aided the Colony. The insurrection was suppressed, and a re-settlement of the lands previously occupied by the insurgents effected, by which greater security in the future is promised.

The Cape Colony customs dues are levied at St. John's River mouth, under a Proclamation dated 2nd August, 1881. The port was annexed to the Colony in 1884.

Under a Proclamation of Sir Bartle Frere, dated the 4th September, 1878, Umqikela, for breach of treaty arrangements, ceased to be recognised as paramount chief of the Pondos, and the sovereignty of the port and estuary of St. John's River was vested in Her Majesty's Government. A Resident was appointed to represent the Government with Umojika, who remained Chief of East Pondoland. Umqikeladied in October, 1887, and in February, 1888, his son Sigau was elected to succeed him. A Resident Commissioner in Pondoland was appointed on 6th July, 1888.
In March, 1894, in consequence of the failure of Sigcau and Nqwiliso to put a stop to the cruelties and misrule prevailing in Pondoland, they were required to submit to Colonial rule, and magistrates were placed in the country. By Act of the Cape Parliament, No. 5 of 1894, the whole country was annexed to the Colony.

West Pondoland was, until the date of annexation, under the Chief Nqwiliso. A small strip of his territory at the mouth of the St. John's River was acquired by the Cape Government for £1,000.

The district of Mount Ayliff, or the Xesibe country, after having long been administered as a dependency of Griqualand East, was formally annexed to the Colony in October, 1886, and the Rode Valley in October, 1887.

The whole of these territories are now within the Province of the Cape of Good Hope, and had a revenue of £171,153/– in 1903-4, which was included in the ordinary Colonial revenue. They are grouped under one Chief Magistrate, stationed at Umtata.

Griqualand East has nine subordinate magistrates. Its population at the Census of 1904 was—Europeans, 5,901; Bantu, 212,069; mixed, 4,062.

Tembuland, comprising Tembuland proper, Bomvanaland, Emigrant Tembuland, and East and West Pondoland, has fourteen subordinate magistrates. It has a population of—Europeans, 8,056; Bantu, 221,313; mixed, 1,327.

Transkei, comprising Fingoland, the Idutywa Reserve, Gcalekaland, has six subordinate magistrates. It has a population of—Europeans, 1,707; Bantu, 175,682; mixed, 197.

British Bechuanaland.—On the 30th of September, 1885, the territories south of the Molopo river and of the Ramathlabama spruit were declared to be British territory under the name of British Bechuanaland, and a commission was issued to the Governor of the Cape to be its Governor, with power to legislate by proclamation. The territory was annexed to the Cape Colony on the 16th of November, 1895.

**Province of Natal.**

**Situation and Area.**

Natal* derives its name from its discovery by Vasco da Gama, the celebrated Portuguese navigator, on Christmas Day, 1497. It lies on the south-east coast of Africa, about 800 miles from Cape Town, and between the 26th and 32nd parallels of S. lat. It is bounded on the north by the Portuguese possessions and the Transvaal, on the west by the Orange Free State and Basutoland, and on the south by the Province of the Cape of Good Hope and Umtamvuna River. It comprises an area of 35,371† square miles, and has a seaboard of 376‡ miles. It is a well-watered country, no less than 35 distinct rivers running into the Indian Ocean in the 376 miles of coast. Unfortunately none of them are navigable. Pietermaritzburg is the seat of the Provincial Government, and has a population of 29,980, exclusive of H.M.'s troops; the largest town and only port is Durban, with 59,000 inhabitants, of whom 14,700 are natives, 13,900 Indians and other Asiatics, and 28,450 whites, the remainder being of mixed descent. (These numbers are now approximate only.)

**History.**

From the discovery of Natal by Vasco da Gama, in 1497, but little is to be found respecting it until 1686, when a Dutch vessel was wrecked in the Bay of Natal. The Dutch formed a settlement in 1721, but soon abandoned it.

In 1824 Lieutenant Farewell, of the Royal Navy, having in the previous year visited Natal on an exploring voyage, endeavoured to colonise it. Tshaka, a chief of the greatest talent, who had fused into a nation under his own despotic sway the various tribes inhabiting a vast tract of country, sanctioned the formation of a settlement by this small band of white men, which, however, was broken up about four years later.

Towards the close of 1837 a large body of Boers from the Cape Colony, taking offence at restrictions placed on them by the British Government in regard to their coloured servants; migrated to Natal. Many of them were treacherously murdered by Dingana, then Zulu chief, the murderer of, and successor to, his brother Tshaka. For two years the Zulus and the Boers waged war with varied success; but in 1839 the Boers obtained a decisive victory, and placed Mpande, an ally of theirs, and brother of Dingana, on the Zulu throne.

Owing chiefly to these disturbances, the Governor of the Cape decided to take military possession of the district, and sent there a force under Captain Smith (1842). These troops came into collision with the Boers, were defeated by them, forced to entrench themselves, and completely blockaded until the arrival of considerable reinforcements under Colonel Cloete. The Boers submitted, on the 5th July, to Colonel Cloete at Pietermaritzburg.

In consequence of the outbreak of war between the South African Republic (as the Transvaal was at that time called) and Orange Free State on one side and Her Majesty's Government on the other, Natal was invaded by the Boer forces in Oct., 1899. The first important engagement took place at Dundee, the Boers being repulsed by an advanced British force under Sir W. Penn Symons, who was mortally wounded. The British troops, under General Yule, then fell back upon Ladysmith, and rejoined the main army of defence under Sir G. White, who in the meantime had gained a decided victory over a Boer commando at Elandslaagte. Ladysmith was invested by a largely superior Boer army on the 28th October. Ladysmith was relieved by the British forces under Sir R. Buller at the end of February, 1900, and the Boers were cleared out of Natal in the course of the following few months, the British advancing into the Transvaal, where Lord Roberts was already operating with an invading army. It was not, however, until the signature of the terms of surrender by the Boer leaders on the 31st May, 1902, that peace was generally restored throughout South Africa, and that Natal was relieved from all further danger from the Boer forces remaining in the field up to that date.

An Act was passed in 1902, providing for the annexation to Natal of certain territories hitherto forming part of the Transvaal, and a Commission appointed to report as to the new boundaries. The new territory was annexed to Natal in January, 1903, and is divided into five Magisterial divisions of Vryheid, Utrecht, Paulpietersburg, Ngotshe, and Babanango. The population at the census of April 17th, 1904, was 5,754 Europeans (mostly Dutch), 45 mixed and others, 5 Indians and Asiatics, 4,104 Natives in service, and 86,911 Natives in native areas: total 96,819. This territory represents an area of 6,970 square miles.

**Zululand and Tongaland.**

The Zulus are a warlike tribe who, in the beginning of the century, under Tshaka, pressed southwards and became consolidated into a powerful and well-organised kingdom. Tshaka was murdered and was succeeded by Dingana in 1828, who came into conflict with the emigrant Dutch, by whom he was deposed in 1839, in favour of his brother Mpande. In the latter years of Mpande Zululand was distracted by the rival ambitions of his sons, and the Natal Government in 1861 sent

Mr. (now the late Sir) Theophilus Shepstone, Secretary for Native Affairs, on a mission to Zululand, to induce the Zulus to recognise some one of Mpande's sons as heir to his throne, and thus restore tranquillity to the country. The son chosen, with the consent of the nation, the king, and the Natal Government, was Cetshwayo, who from that time acted to a great extent as regent for his father until the latter died in 1873. Cetshwayo, at the instance of Mr. Shepstone, proclaimed certain new laws, which in effect came to this, that he was not to kill his subjects without adequate cause and without trial. The relations between Cetshwayo and Natal during the first years of his reign were not unfriendly, though they became occasionally strained through disregard by him of his coronation law. But after the annexation by England of the Transvaal, a material change in the relations of the two Powers took place. Cetshwayo had long hated the Boers, with whom he had a boundary dispute, dating from 1861, and after the annexation his enmity appeared to be transferred to the new Government. The Zulu war party wanted at once to occupy the whole territory in dispute, and a collision between the Zulus and the British Government of the Transvaal appeared imminent, but was averted by the suggestion of Sir Henry Bulwer, Lieutenant-Governor of Natal, to refer the dispute to the arbitration of three Commissioners to be selected by himself. This was accepted, both by Sir T. Shepstone, as Governor of the Transvaal, and by Cetshwayo, and approved by Her Majesty's Government; the final award being, however, by them reserved to Sir B. Frere as Her Majesty's High Commissioner in South Africa. The Natal Commission reported, in June, 1878, in favour of the claims of the Zulu king, and in September Sir B. Frere arrived in Natal and took up the consideration of the boundary dispute, and also of our general relations with the Zulus, which were becoming more and more strained. On the 11th of December his award in the arbitration was delivered to the representatives of the Zulu nation at the Lower Tugela Drift. At the same time Cetshwayo was required to introduce some modification of his administration, especially as regards military service, and to surrender certain refugees from Natal, and pay a fine for harbouring them, and for border outrages by his subjects.

The king not having complied, the further enforcement of the demands was confided to Lieut.-General Lord Chelmsford, whose forces advanced into Zululand in three columns between the 11th and 14th of January, 1879. On the 22nd of January two engagements were fought; one at Isandhlwana, the other at Inyezane; the former with disastrous, the latter with doubtful, results to the British. On the same night part of the Zulu impi crossed the Buffalo and attacked the commissariat and hospital post of Rorke's Drift, held by one company of the 24th Regiment. The post was without defences; but the officer in command, Lieut. Chard, R.E., V.C., with great rapidity and skill converted the stores themselves into a defence, and throughout the whole night the little garrison, behind a flimsy rampart of rice bags and biscuit boxes, successfully maintained an heroic defence.

In the meantime, the northern column, under Colonel (now Sir Evelyn) Wood, continued to engage and harass the enemy. Even in this part, British arms were not free from disaster at the Intombi River, and in a reconnaissance at the Hlobane Mountain; but immediately after the whole Zulu army, numbering 24,000 men, having attacked Wood's camp at Kambula Kop, suffered a severe defeat.

At the beginning of April, reinforcements having begun to arrive from England and the neighbouring colonies, Lord Chelmsford advanced across the Lower Tugela to the relief of Colonel Pearson, who was shut up in Eshowe; defeated the enemy at Gingindlovu on the 2nd of April, and relieved the garrison.

The military power of the Zulu kingdom was finally broken to pieces at the battle of Ulundi on the 4th of July, and Cetshwayo fled to the bush with a few followers. The people accepted their defeat with singular calmness, at once returning to their usual avocations. Chief after chief submitted, and Cetshwayo himself was captured. The dynasty of Shaka was deposed, and the country was divided into thirteen districts, each under an independent chief, holding office by the gift of the Queen of England, subject to certain conditions accepted by him; a British resident was appointed to reside in Zululand, and be the adviser of the chiefs and channel of communication between them and the British Government.

Difficulties were soon experienced in working this arrangement. Some of the chiefs quarrelled and fought with one another and with their subjects, many of whom refused to recognise their authority; while a large and influential party were anxious for the restoration of Cetshwayo. Sir H. Bulwer, who had assumed the government of Natal in the early part of 1882, was specially commissioned to inquire into the whole question of the Zulu settlement. After fully considering his report, Her Majesty's Government decided to replace the ex-king over the whole country north of the Umblatuze River, with the exception of a small territory in the north-east, which Usibepu, one of the thirteen chiefs appointed by Sir Garnet Wolseley, was allowed to retain. The territory between the Umblatuze and the Natal frontier was constituted a native reserve, under the supervision of a British commissioner, and it was arranged that locations should be provided in this reserve for any of the Zulus who might be unwilling to again submit to the restored king. Cetshwayo, who had at his own request been allowed to visit England, where the decision of the Government was communicated to him, and by him formally accepted, was reinstalled by Sir Theophilus Shepstone on the 29th January, 1883, in the presence of 5,000 Zulus.

His enemies, headed by Usibepu, proved more formidable than he or others had anticipated, and after a struggle of some months he was overthrown and his kraal destroyed. He took refuge in the Reserve, where he lived practically under the care of the Resident, until the 8th of February, 1884, when he died. Soon after his death his followers, the Usutus (the name by which the personal adherents of Cetshwayo—as distinct from the Zulus in general—were known), finding themselves no match for Usibepu, called in some Boer adventurers, with whose assistance they inflicted a crushing defeat on Usibepu, who took refuge in the Reserve. And as a reward for this service the Boers received a grant of land, in which they established the "New Republic."

Finding that the Zulu people were unable to form any orderly administration of the remaining territory, Her Majesty's Government decided, with the general assent of the Zulus, to declare their country to be British territory, which was done in May, 1887. Some disturbances occurred soon
after in connection with an attempt to set up Dinuzulu, a son of Cetshwayo, as King; but it was soon checked, with the assistance of the Imperial troops, and Dinuzulu with his uncles Ndabuko and Tshingana were arrested, tried and convicted of high treason, and removed to St. Helena, while other offenders were tried on other charges, and imprisoned or fined. Dinuzulu and his two uncles were permitted to return from exile at the beginning of 1898.

In 1890 Tongaland and the districts of Fokoti, Umjindi, and Manaba, were proclaimed part of Zululand.

In 1895 the territories of the Chiefs Mbikiza and Sambana, in extent 668 square miles, lying between Zululand and Swaziland, the Portuguese territories, and Tongaland, were annexed to Zululand.

By Government Notice, dated 11th June, 1895, a British Protectorate was declared over the territory of Tongaland, also called Maputaland, which is about 1,200 square miles in area, and is bounded on the north by Portuguese possessions, on the west and south by Zululand, and on the east by the Indian Ocean. Under the Anglo-Portuguese Convention, signed at Lisbon on 11th June, 1891, the spheres of influence of Great Britain and Portugal over the country occupied by the Tongas was defined by a line following the parallel of the confluence of the River Pongolo with the River Maputa to the sea coast. The boundary then agreed upon was surveyed in 1896, and laid off by a joint commission appointed by the British and Portuguese Governments.

In November, 1897, a Bill was introduced into the Natal Parliament to provide for the annexation of Zululand to Natal, and became law. A Proclamation was issued by the Governor on the 30th December, giving effect to the annexation from that date. The British Tongaland Protectorate had been previously annexed to the Queen's dominions, and were incorporated with Zululand on the 27th December, 1897.

In 1906 a serious native rebellion broke out in the colony and spread to Zululand. It was suppressed by the Colonial forces, with assistance from detachments of volunteers from the Transvaal and the Cape Colony. A Commission was appointed to enquire into the native question generally, and the Commission's Report has since been published.

In 1907 there was a further recrudescence of unrest amongst the natives in Zululand, which was, however, easily suppressed without actual bloodshed. Dinuzulu, son of Cetshwayo, together with other chiefs and ringleaders, was arrested, and tried on charges of high treason, rebellion, sedition, murder, etc., and found guilty, though complicity in the murders of several noted loyalist Chiefs was not proved as against Dinuzulu. Dinuzulu was sentenced to four years imprisonment, whilst other Chiefs were sentenced for longer periods and transported to St. Helena. It was generally believed that prompt action was the means of arresting what might have been a very serious conflagration.

**Constitution.**

In 1843 the district of Natal was proclaimed by the Governor of the Cape to be a British Colony. In May, 1844, Letters Patent were issued, constituting the district a part of the Cape Colony. Ordinances were passed by the Cape Legislature establishing Roman-Dutch law, and providing for the administration of justice. In April, 1846, other Letters Patent were issued making Natal a separate Government. A Lieutenant-Governor was appointed, and an Executive Council created. The Lieutenant-Governor was subordinate to the Governor of the Cape, and the Legislative Council of the Cape continued to frame laws for Natal till 1847, when a separate Legislative Council was established.

In 1856 Natal was erected into a distinct and separate Colony, its affairs being administered, under the Royal Charter of the 15th July of that year, by a Governor, assisted by an Executive and a Legislative Council.

The law establishing responsible government (The Constitution Act of 1893) received the Royal Assent on the 26th June, 1893, and on the 10th October, 1893, the first Ministry was appointed.

Every male inhabitant who possesses property to the value of 50£., or rents property of an annual value of 10£., or who has been a resident in the Colony for three years, and whose income, inclusive of allowances, is equal to 8£. per month, is entitled to vote.

The act constituting the Union of South Africa was passed by the Imperial Parliament on the 20th September, 1909, and Natal became a Province of the Union on the 31st May, 1910.

**Local Government.**

There are municipal corporations in Durban, Maritzburg, Newcastle, Ladysmith, and Dundee, and local boards in Verulam, Greytown, Utrecht Vryheid, Estcourt, Charlestown, and South Barrow. Their total revenue in 1909 was 530,686£., their expenditure 518,154£., and their debt 3,749,538£.

**Native Affairs.**

In 1873, Langalibalele, chief of the Amahlubi Tribe, residing in a location at foot of the Drakensberg Mountains, rebelled and escaped into Basutoland with his people and cattle. A Colonial force was dispatched against the tribe, and Langalibalele and many of the tribe were secured in Basutoland and given up. Langalibalele, his sons, indunas, and certain of his tribe were brought to trial under "native law." About 290 prisoners were condemned to various terms of imprisonment. Langalibalele himself was condemned to banishment or transportation for life, and one of his sons to a similar punishment for five years. The cattle and land of the tribe were confiscated. Langalibalele and his sons were transported to the Cape of Good Hope. They were allowed to return to Natal in 1886.

The native population had until then been governed chiefly under the authority of Ordinance No. 3 of 1849, which withdrew them from the authority of the Roman-Dutch Law, and placed them under the personal authority of the Governor as Supreme Chief, and made native law and custom the measure of justice among them in civil and criminal matters, a concurrent jurisdiction being reserved to the ordinary law courts in cases of crime mala in se. This system of government remains in operation at the present time under the provisions of Laws 26, 1875, and 44, 1887. The native population was debarred from the franchise by a Law, No. 11 of 1865; but at the same time, and by the same Law, regulations were laid down by which any native may in certain cases apply to the Governor for a certificate entitling him to the privilege. Subsequently, by a Law, No. 28 of 1883, machinery was provided by which a native might procure his relief from the operation of native law.
It was decided to supersede very gradually the tribal organisation, and the judicial and other authority of the chiefs. A law (No. 26 of 1875) established a Native High Court to administer civil justice to the natives, and placed them under the ordinary criminal law of the Colony, except as regards political crimes, crimes arising out of native customs, and crimes declared triable under any local law by native law, all which crimes are reserved for the Native High Court. By Act No. 13, 1895, the Native High Court and the Court established by Law No. 10, 1876, were abolished, and the jurisdiction of these courts transferred to the Supreme and Circuit Courts, and in certain cases to the Magistrates' Courts. As it was found, however, that this arrangement did not work so well as had been anticipated, the Native High Court was re-established under Act No. 49, 1898, with effect from 1st July, 1899. Certain locations were specially reserved by Government, and vested in the Natal Native Trust, for exclusive occupation by natives. But besides the natives occupying these lands there are many native squatters on Crown lands, and many living by regular labour on farms. By Law No. 13, of 1875, the native hut tax was raised from 7s. to 14s. Under Law No. 41 of 1884, a rent of 1l. per hut was imposed upon natives living on Crown lands. This was raised by Act No. 48 of 1903 to 2l. per hut per annum.

The area vested in the Native Trust, for occupation by natives, is about 2,400,000 acres, the land (127,716 acres) formerly held by certain religious missions in trust for the natives having, by Act No. 49 of 1903, been transferred to the Natal Native Trust.

Estimated Number of Natives living in Locations (about)

- Mission Reserves: 275,000
- Crown Lands: 30,000
- Private do.: 12,000
- Zululand: 570,000
- Do. do.: 250,000

Climate and Inhabitants.

The climate varies at different levels. On the coast line it is sub-tropical. On the high lands it is very little hotter than English summer weather in the summer months; in the winter the air is generally exceedingly dry, and several degrees of frost at night are not uncommonly experienced, and snowstorms occasionally occur. There is a large proportion of cloudless days in the summer, and the sky is bright throughout the winter months.

Malarial fever was epidemic in coast districts during 1905 and 1906, but, thanks to the energetic measures taken by the authorities, it has been stamped out, while very few cases have occurred inland.

The death rates of Europeans or whites, including those classed in the Census returns as mixed and others, at Pietermaritzburg and Durban for 1908 were 11·5 and 9·51 per thousand respectively, and for the Colony 8·87.

At the census of 1904, the Europeans numbered 97,109, or 8·8 per cent., of whom about 12,500 were Dutch, the rest being chiefly British, with the exception of about 4,500 colonists of German descent, of whom the greater portion are settled in the New Hanover and Lower Umgikulu divisions.

As estimated at 31st December, 1909:

- Europeans or Whites: 92,643
- Mixed and others: 7,080
- Indians and Asiatics: 118,714
- All natives: 1,030,597

Total: 1,249,034

It is believed that about 55 per cent. of the present white population were born in the Colony.

Means of Communication.

There is a weekly mail service with England (26 to 22 days), with the Cape and Inland Colonies daily, with Mauritius and East Coast ports (Inhambane, Chiloane, Beira, Mozambique, Ibo, etc.) once or twice a month, with Delagoa Bay, via the Transvaal, daily, with Australia fortnightly, and at intervals of ten or twelve days with India. Steamers pass between Natal and Table Bay every week, calling at East London, Port Elizabeth, and Mossel Bay. There are also two direct lines of steamers between London and Durban, the average passage of which is about 26 days. Also, one or two of the Australian lines of steamers, calling at Port Natal, take passengers for London, and vice versa. Two mail and passenger trains leave daily for Johannesburg, and for Cape Town via either Johannesburg or Bethlehem and Bloemfontein (Orange Free State), the distance being accomplished in 24 hours to Johannesburg, and in from 60 to 64 hours to Capetown. There is also a daily mail and passenger service to Victoria Falls and Rhodesia, via Johannesburg and Fourteen Streams.

There is direct land telegraph communication with the Transvaal, the Orange Free State, the Cape, Rhodesia, Delagoa Bay, and other parts of South Africa; and by cable with Zanzibar, Aden, Europe, and the world generally. A Marconi Wireless Installation has recently been established at Port Natal, which has an effective daylight range of 250 miles; this figure has been greatly exceeded in night operations, which have been successfully carried out over more than 1,200 miles. Telephonic communication by means of a trunk line has been established between the principal towns in the Colony, and with Johannesburg; while Telephone Call Offices, with Trunk Line facilities, have been established over practically the whole of the Colony.

The rates of postage are:

- Internal and Cape: 1d.
- Orange River Colony and Transvaal: 1d.
- U.K., India, and certain British Colonies*: 1d.
- Most other countries: 2½d.

Letters, ½ oz. Newspapers, ½d. per ¼ oz.

There are 1,975½ miles of Government telegraphs, and 144 miles of telephone line, constructed at a cost of about 245,753L, and the earnings of the Post and Telegraph Departments

* Letter postage to the U.K., India, and to other Colonies and countries which joined the Penny Post agreement, was reduced to 1d. per ¼ oz. from the 25th Dec., 1898. (See end of Introduction.)
for the year 1908 were 176,937l. (exclusive of the value of Government messages, 36,049l.), and the expenses 185,499l.

**Industries.**

The chief industries are the production of sugar, tea, wattle bark, wool, maize, potatoes, Kaffir corn and the mining of coal; dairying; fruit culture; and the breeding of cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry. Ostrich farming has also been re-introduced, on up-to-date lines, with every promise of success, within the past twelve months. The chief exports are coal, maize, wool, mohair, wattle bark, tea, sugar, tobacco, fruit and fruit preserves, hides and skins. The chief imports are apparel and cotton goods, haberdashery, woollen manufactures, leather goods, hardware and machinery, wooden manufactures, living animals, corn and grain, agricultural implements and seeds, articles of food and drink including frozen meats, tobacco, and books and stationery. A large and increasing trade, principally with the Province of Orange Free State and Transvaal, is carried on, and the bulk of the overseas imports goes to the inland centres. In 1899 the value of exports was 3,027,663l.; in 1909 their value had increased to 10,281,667l. In 1899 the value of overseas imports exclusive of bullion and specie, was 5,354,248l.; and in 1909 they had increased to 7,135,814l., exclusive of Government stores, value 493,883l., the greater part of which came from the United Kingdom.

The bar which used to exist at the entrance to the Port of Durban has been entirely removed, by an extension of the permanent works and by constant dredging, the average depth at low water in 1909 being 34 ft. 3 ins. as against 19 ft. 7 ins. in 1899. The largest ships are now able at all times to come in and go out with perfect safety, and discharge their cargoes directly on to the wharves.

Durban is a port of registry, having in 1909, 25 vessels, with a tonnage of 1,419 tons net, including a few of the older vessels belonging to Government.

A whaling industry has been established at Durban, and has given most promising results. The total number of whales killed and landed were 106 in 1908, and 155 in 1909.

The land under cultivation amounted in 1909 to 903,638 acres, of which 451,638 acres were cultivated by Europeans, and there is a good scope for dairying and stock-farming. An overseas export trade in maize was initiated in 1907, and as a result of the success which attended the Government's efforts in this direction, the area under the crop increased by about 12 per cent. during the 1908-9 season, and a further increase is expected in regard to the 1909-10 crop. An overseas export trade in citrus fruits has also been commenced, and there appear to be great possibilities before the Colony in this direction; and it is also contemplated to experiment with the export of apples and other fruits shortly. A starch factory has been established on the coast, the raw material used for which is the sweet potato, which grows well in the Colony; and there is also a proposal on foot to establish a beet sugar factory at Pietermaritzburg. The coal-mining industry continues to increase every year, the output for 1909 being 1,786,583 tons (the value of which at the pit's mouth was 633,604l.), as against 328,693 tons in 1899 (value 139,800l., at the pit's mouth). The amount consumed in the Railway Department within the Colony in 1909 was 266,286 tons. There is also a considerable and growing trade in bunker and export coal, the coal bunkered in 1909 being 835,496 tons, and exported, 506,340 tons. There were 26 outputting collieries in 1909. The present output is at the rate of over 1,800,000 tons per annum, and this rate will be increased. The freight charge for railway transport is ½d. a ton per mile.

The produce of sugar in 1909 was 86,790 tons (short), and this total will certainly be greatly exceeded during the next few years. A large quantity of sugar-cane is grown for the purpose of feeding stock. The production in 1909 by European farmers included maize, 797,820 muids; tea, 1,773,202 lbs.; wattle bark, 24,207 tons; potatoes, 144,820 muids; sweet potatoes, 57,061 muids; wool, 2,669,088 lbs.; and they owned, cattle, 210,412; horses, 31,586; mules, 6,532; donkeys, 9,330; sheep, 916,996; goats, 135,848; pigs, 25,738; ostriches, 803.

**Education.**

In the year ended 30th June, 1909, there were 501 schools under Government inspection—269 European, 19 coloured, 178 native, and 35 Indian—with an aggregate attendance of 29,114. There are 52 Government schools, and 449 Government-aided schools. Since the establishment of Union Education, other than Higher Education, which is controlled by the Union Government, comes under the control of the Provincial Administration, with the Superintendent of Education as permanent head of the Department, and the local control occasionally in committees. Education is compulsory. There are Government secondary schools at Pietermaritzburg and Durban, as well as private establishments. The expenditure on education, for the financial year 1908-09, amounted to 107,965l. 8s. 5d., and the revenue to 15,040l. 5s. 7d.

**PROVINCE OF THE ORANGE FREE STATE.**

**Situation, Area, and Population.**

The Province of the Orange Free State lies to the north of the Orange River and the Province of the Cape of Good Hope, and to the south of the Vaal River. On the east it is bounded by Basutoland and the Province of Natal. The area is about 50,000 square miles, and the country, which lies at an altitude of 4,000 to 5,000 feet above the sea, consists chiefly of grassy plains; but to the east, on the Basutoland border, it is hilly. The rainfall is moderate, and the country is mainly devoted to stock-farming, though grain is raised in parts.

The population, according to the last census, which was taken in 1904, was 387,315, of whom 142,679 were white.

Bloemfontein is the seat of the Provincial Government.

**History.**

The Orange River was first crossed by a European in 1760, but no attempt was made to settle the country for many years after. Emigrants from the great trek established themselves at Winburg and elsewhere, but the Colonial Government for some time made no attempt to establish any administration. In 1848, however, owing to the disputes between the settlers and the natives, Sir Harry Smith issued a Proclamation declaring the whole territory between the Orange River and Vaal River to be under the sovereignty of the Queen, and a British Resident was appointed at Bloemfontein, with Assistant-Commissioners at Winburg and the Caledon River. The discontented farmers under Pretorius took up arms, but were defeated by Sir Harry Smith at Boomplaats. The British Government, however, before long determined to abandon the territory; and in 1854 Sir George Clerk, the Special Commissioner for "the settling and adjustment of the affairs of the Orange River Sovereignty," signed the Convention of Bloemfontein, by which, much against the will of many of the inhabitants, British sovereignty was withdrawn, and the independence of the country was recognised.

The history of the Orange Free State was in the main peaceable, but a good deal of fighting followed with the Basutos, and in 1866 Moshesh was compelled to cede much of his best cornland. The Basutos appealed to the High Commissioner and were taken under British protection, but by the Treaty of Aliwal North in 1869 the incorporation of the conquered territory into the Orange Free State was recognised.

About the same time the discovery of diamonds at Kimberley and the inrush of diggers led to a dispute between Her Majesty's Government and that of the Orange Free State as to the boundary, which was ultimately settled in 1876 by a Convention signed in London by President Brand providing for a payment by Great Britain of a sum of 90,000l. in consideration of the abandonment of the Free State claim.

The Government of the Orange Free State consisted of a President, elected every five years, assisted by an Executive Council and a Volksraad, containing 60 members, half of whom retired every two years. The Orange Free State had since 1889 been a member of the Customs Union, to which the Cape and latterly Natal also belonged. In the same year the railway to the Vaal was completed.
by the Cape Government, which continued to work
the line until after the Jameson raid, when the
Free State took it over.

In 1889, not long after the death of President
Brand, whose wisdom and moderation had won
general recognition, the Orange Free State entered
into an alliance with the South African Republic.
This alliance was renewed in 1897, and was ap-
pealed to as binding the Free State to assist the
South African Republic in her quarrel with Great
Britain in 1899. This course was determined on by
a resolution of the Volksraad taken on the 27th of
September, 1899, and resulted * in the annexation
of the country to the British dominions by a
Proclamation of Lord Roberts issued on the 28th
of May, 1900, the new Colony being called the
Orange River Colony, and Lord Roberts being
appointed Administrator. Sir Alfred Milner suc-
ceeded to the Administration on the departure of
Lord Roberts from South Africa at the end of the
year 1900, and was afterwards selected for appoint-
ment as Governor both of the Transvaal and of the
Orange River Colony. Major (now Sir) H. J.
Goold-Adams was selected for the post of Lieut.-
Governor. Early in 1905 Lord Milner resigned,
and in May of that year his successor, Lord
Selborne, arrived in South Africa. On the
establishment of Responsible Government, July,
1907, Sir Hamilton Goold-Adams became
Governor of the Colony.

On the restoration of peace in 1902 Crown
Colony Government was established, and con-
tinued till 30th June, 1907, when Responsible
Government was granted. The election of the
first Legislative Assembly took place in
November, 1907.

The Legislature consisted of two Chambers—
a Legislative Council and a Legislative Assembly,
consisting of 11 and 39 members respectively.

On the 31st May, 1910, the Orange River
Colony became, under the name of the Orange
Free State, a Province of the Union of South
Africa, and is now governed in terms of the
South Africa Act which constituted the Union of
South Africa. Apart from the general control of
the Union Parliament the Act provided that the
control of certain specified matters should be
vested in an Administrator and Provincial
Council.

**Climate.**

The Orange River Colony can be separated,
roughly, into three divisions—viz., the western,
the middle, and the eastern.

The western division is the driest, but is
the best for grazing of sheep. The soil is fertile,
but requires irrigation. Rainfall averages 14
inches.

The middle division, through which the main
line railway runs, holds moisture longer than the
western division, and will grow certain crops
without irrigation. There are large tracts of
grass lands good for grazing stock. Rainfall
averages 18 ins.

The eastern division is the best watered of the
three, the climate being moist. This division is
the wheat-growing area, and large quantities of
wheat and other cereals can be grown. It is
fairly well adapted for stock, but the winter is
somewhat severe. Rainfall averages 24 ins.

The heat, especially in the middle and western
divisions, is great during the months of December,
January, and February, the temperature at
Bloemfontein, altitude 4,510 feet above the sea,
has risen on individual days to 102° Fahr. at
12 noon in the shade, the mean maximum being
75° and the mean minimum 480°.

The eastern division is cooler, and in winter it
is no unusual sight to see snow on the mountains.
Harrismith is a great summer resort for the people
of Durban and Maritzburg (Natal), the temperature
there being cool and delightful in summer.

The climate of Bloemfontein is well adapted for
those suffering from phthisis, and has long been
known as a health resort for this disease.

The rainfall is most abundant in the summer.
The following is the mean monthly and annual
rainfall at Bloemfontein:

| Month | Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June |

0°44 0°42 0°37 1°37 1°32 2°33
Total for Year ... ... 20°02

Dust storms are frequent in spring.

Industries.

The leading industry of the country is agriculture, inclusive of stock and sheep-farming. The output of coal has increased from 470,590 tons for 1908-9 to 564,979 tons valued at 10,632£. for 1909-10. There is an increase in the output of diamonds of from 654,319 cts. in 1908-9 to 787,613½ cts. valued at 1,525,706£. in 1909-10.

Land Settlement.

The 1909-10 season has not been as good all round as the previous one, due principally to the partial failure of summer rains and total failure of autumn rainfall which resulted in a very severe winter for stock to go through. Prospects, however, are better than for years past. The stock census return for 1909 shows a decrease in sheep of 14,578, and an increase in cattle of 4,841. There are 647 heads of families, of which 571 are of British and 76 of Dutch descent. The new Land Board, appointed by H.E. The Governor under the terms of Letters Patent granting responsible Government to the Colony, took up their duties on October 1st, 1907. The title deeds of 1,521,041 acres of land were transferred to the Board, the remaining unallotted and undeveloped land, amounting to 118,500 acres, passing to the control of the Government. Revenue received from settlers from October 1st, 1909, to September 30th, 1910, amounted to 50,248£. Expenditure during same period in loans to settlers, development of land, administration expenses, etc., 54,823£. There are still over 200 approved applicants waiting for any available land under the control of the Board.

Education.

Education, except higher education, as defined by the South Africa Act, 1909, is under the control of the Administrator of the Province for the Provincial Council, and is administered by a Director. From 1900 to 1905 the schools were managed, teachers were selected and appointed, and all expenditure was borne by the Government. Local Education Committees were established in the towns in 1903, but these were merely advisory bodies. In terms of an agreement come to between the Government and representatives of the Dutch Reformed Church in March, 1905, the Christian National Schools, which had been started a year previously, were amalgamated with the Government Schools.

In 1908 a new School Act was passed and came into force on the 1st November. The principal changes introduced by this Act are as follows:

Fees are payable in respect of pupils at all primary and secondary public schools and aided private schools, provision being made for exemption in necessitous cases. English and Dutch are put on an equal footing as media of instruction in the various subjects of the curriculum, certain modifications being permitted according to circumstances during the first three years after the taking effect of the Act. With the exception of certain high schools, every primary and secondary public school is placed under the supervision of a committee consisting of five or seven members (according to the size and importance of the school) elected by the parents of children attending such school. The central local control in each district is vested in the District Board, which consists of nine members, the bare majority of whom are elected by the committees within the district, and the rest appointed by the Minister in charge of Education. Religious instruction can only be given by members of the school staff, and dogmatic teaching is prohibited during school hours, except in country schools when parents request that such instruction be given.

On the termination of hostilities in 1902 the total number of pupils attending permanent schools in the Orange River Colony was 1,333. Many children were then receiving instruction in the refugee camp schools. In June, 1903, when all the refugee camps had been broken up, the numbers in attendance at town and country schools in the Colony were 9,031. In 1909 the roll was 18,863.

Students are prepared for the B.A. and M.A. degrees, Law, Survey, Engineering and Pharmacy Examinations at Grey University College, Bloemfontein, new buildings for which have now been erected on an extensive site in the west of the city, where the Grey College School and hostels are also situated.

A normal school in Bloemfontein provides for the training of teachers, and bursaries are given on the results of an entrance examination held annually in April.

There is also an industrial school in Bloemfontein where orphans and sons of poor parents are maintained and supervised at Government expense, and apprenticed to various trades and industries in the town.

Courses of instruction are also given in agriculture at Grey College, in household economy at Eunice High School, and in cookery, dressmaking, art needlework and millinery in Bloemfontein and at various other centres in the Colony.

Spinning and weaving schools have also been started recently, and have met with a considerable measure of success.

The above statement refers to the education and training of white people only. A small grant is also given annually in aid of the education of natives. This grant is paid to the various religious denominations which undertake the work of native education, and the amount is in proportion to the number of children in the schools. There are about 10,000 native children in these schools.

TRANSVAAL PROVINCE.

Situation and Area.

The Transvaal lies to the north of the Orange Free State Province and to the south of Rhodesia, being bounded on the west by the Bechuanaland protectorate, and to the east chiefly by the Portuguese possessions, but touching Natal Province at the south-east corner. Its limits stretch from 28°40' to 22° S. degrees of latitude and between 24°40' and 32°10' E. in longitude.

Its area is 110,425 square miles, with a population, according to the census of 17th April, 1904, of 1,269,951, of whom 297,277 are whites, 337,127 aboriginal natives, and 35,547 other coloured races. The estimated population in 1910 was 1,400,000, of whom 350,000 were Europeans. The greater part lies high, seldom less than 4,000 feet above the sea. The climate is healthy, except in the lower country, to the north and east, which is hot and often feverish. The winter is the dry, and the summer the wet season. Heavy thunder storms are frequent in summer.

History.

The first European settlers in the Transvaal Territory were emigrant Cape farmers. The original destination of these emigrants was Natal, but upon the annexation of Natal to the English Crown most of them left the new district, and turning back over the Drakensberg went, some to the Orange River Territory, and others to the country beyond the Vaal. In 1848 British sovereignty was extended over the Orange River Territory, but no attempt was made by the British government to exercise authority over its unwilling subjects beyond the Vaal, and in January, 1852, a treaty was made with them, containing a promise that they would not be interfered with in the management of their own affairs. This treaty is known as the Sand River Convention. The emigrants at the time formed three independent communities, which did not unite until 1858, when they adopted for themselves the name of the South African Republic. After fifteen years of somewhat chequered history, the people of the Transvaal elected as President the Rev. Thomas Burgers, a clergyman of the Dutch Reformed Church, from the Cape Colony, and high hopes were entertained by many for the future of the Republic under his guidance. These hopes were not fulfilled. Misfortunes followed one another in rapid succession, and only ended with the collapse of the Government, and the extinction of the Republic.

The President early conceived the project of a railway to be made from Delagoa Bay into the Republic, to carry its produce profitably to the sea; and to promote this project he visited Europe in 1875, concluded a treaty with Portugal, and essayed to launch a loan of 300,000l. in Amsterdam, of which, however, only about 74,000l. were subscribed. This money he spent in buying plant for the proposed railway. In the meantime the Provisional government of the Republic had drifted into a dispute with the Zulu King, Cetshwayo, touching the boundary of Utrecht Province; and on his return the President himself engaged, first in a dispute with, and then in actual military operations against, Sikukuni, a Bechuana chief, living on the north-east of the Republic, whose country was claimed under an ambiguous and not very intelligible treaty in the Dutch language, to which some Boers had obtained the assent of Sikukuni's father in the year 1857. The operations against Sikukuni, which were upon a large scale, looking to the resources of the Republic, and were directed in person by the President, ended in failure. The Republican field army melted away; a guerrilla war, however, was continued by a small mercenary force, until a peace was concluded early in 1877. In the meantime the defeat of the Boers by an insignificant tribe of an unwarlike branch of the native race, and their inability to repair the disaster, were producing alarming excitement in the native mind, and the peace of South Africa being deemed to be in evident danger, Her Majesty's Government despatched Sir Theophilus Shepstone, who happened to be in London at the time, to South Africa, as a Special Commissioner from Her Majesty, to watch events, and take such action as might be necessary to secure the general peace. When Sir Theophilus Shepstone arrived in the Transvaal, he considered on a review of all the circumstances that no other course was open to him than to proclaim the Queen's sovereignty. This he did on the 12th of April by a proclamation which was approved by Her Majesty's Government.

The annexation of the Transvaal was effected without the aid of physical force. Sir T. Shepstone at the time had with him but a few mounted policemen; and Her Majesty's troops did not arrive in the province for some time after the English Government had been set up, with the apparent acquiescence of its people. But subsequently hostile feelings towards the annexation were widely manifested, and two deputations were sent to England after annexation, to represent those who were opposed to that measure and desired a withdrawal of the British Government. In each case the answer of Her late Majesty's Government was a decided refusal.

In December, 1880, a majority of the Boers took up arms against the Government, and hoisted the flag of the South African Republic at Heidelberg. The towns held by Imperial troops were immediately invested, and a detachment of the 94th Regiment, which was being withdrawn from Lydenburg to Pretoria, to strengthen the force at headquarters, was surprised, and after suffering very heavy loss, compelled to surrender. The towns, however, held out, and Sir G. Pomeroy Colley, without waiting for reinforcements, collected the small force at his disposal and advanced from Pietermaritzburg in Natal to relieve them. A large force of Boers opposed his entry into the Transvaal at Laing's Nek, the path across the Drakensberg mountains.

On the 28th of January the English troops made a gallant attempt to carry this pass by storm, but they were driven back with heavy loss. The Boers followed up this advantage by cutting off Sir G. Colley's communications with Newcastle, with a view to prevent his receiving the reinforcements which had been sent out, and were now on the way up. To re-open his communications he crossed the Ingogo River on the morning of the 8th of February, and was immediately attacked by the Boers. The action continued all day; at nightfall the Boers drew off, and the English forces returned to their camp.

In the meantime strenuous efforts were being made by President Brand, of the Orange Free State, to bring about an understanding, and in reply to the appeal which he made to Her Majesty's Government, they declared that if the Boers would desist from armed opposition to the English troops, a scheme would be framed for the permanent friendly settlement of all difficulties. This message
was forwarded to the Boers on the 21st of February in a letter addressed to Mr. Paul Kruger, one of their leaders, by General Colley, and an answer was required within forty-eight hours. Mr. Kruger was away at Rustenburg, and the letter was sent unopened to the headquarters of the Boers at Heidelberg. Dr. Bok, who was acting as State Secretary, sent it on to Mr. Kruger, and replied to General Colley that no definite answer could be given to the message from Her Majesty's Government until Mr. Kruger's views were known. Dr. Bok's message did not reach the camp at Laing's Nek till the 1st of March. On the night of the 26th of February, General Colley, having received no reply to his message, moved out with three hundred and fifty men, and took possession of the summit of the Majuba Mountain, a spur of the Drakensberg, commanding the Boer camp at Laing's Nek. The Boers attacked the mountain next day, and carried it by storm, with little loss, while only about one-fifth of the defenders escaped, the rest being killed, wounded, or taken prisoners. Sir G. Pomeroy Colley himself was killed by a bullet through his forehead.

The command now devolved on Sir E. Wood, who was at Pietermaritzburg organising the advance of the reinforcements, and, at the instance of President Brand, an interview took place on the 6th of March between him and General Joubert, who was in command of the Boers at Laing's Nek, which resulted in the conclusion of an armistice, with a view to allow time for the receipt of Mr. Kruger's reply to the message of Her Majesty's Government. Mr. Kruger's answer, written on the 28th of February at Heidelberg, was received by Sir E. Wood on the 7th of March, and it was considered satisfactory. A preliminary peace agreement was signed on the 21st March by Sir E. Wood and the representatives of the Boers. The terms of the agreement were that Her Majesty's Government should allow the Transvaal self-government as regards its own interior affairs; that the control and management of the foreign relations of the State should be reserved to Her Majesty as suzerain; and that the Government of the Transvaal should recognise a British Resident. The functions of this officer, and the provisions for the protection of the interests of the native population, were to be determined by Her Majesty's Government on the recommendation of a Royal Commission.

The Commissioners who were appointed to consider the whole question of the settlement of the affairs of the Transvaal were Sir H. Robinson, Sir E. Wood, and Sir J. H. de Villiers, Chief Justice of the Cape Colony; and President Brand was invited to be present at the conferences of the Commissioners with the representatives of the Boers, as a person friendly to both parties. The sittings of the Commission were opened on the 28th of April at Newcastle, from which they were afterwards transferred to Pretoria. The recommendations of the Commission were submitted in detail to Her Majesty's Government, and in the result a Convention was framed embodying the terms of the peace agreement, assigning the boundaries of the State, defining the functions of the Resident as analogous to those of a consul-general and chargé d'affaires, and conferring upon him extensive powers for the protection of the interests of the natives in the Transvaal. He also formed the medium of communication between the Government of the Transvaal and the native States on its borders. Stipulations were made for the repayment of the sums advanced by Her Majesty's Government in aid of the revenue of the Transvaal during the occupation; and a sub-commission, composed of the two judges of the High Court and Mr. Hudson, the British Resident, was appointed to consider claims for compensation for losses sustained during the hostilities.

The Convention was signed on the 3rd of August, and on the 8th of that month the Government was handed over to the representatives of the Boers. The Convention was finally ratified by a duly-elected Volksraad on the 25th of October.

The Transvaal State, however, showed little disposition to acquiesce in the Pretoria Convention, and constant trouble occurred on the border, especially on the South-Western border, where the Bechuanaland tribes suffered severely from the incursions of freebooters from the Transvaal, which the Transvaal Government entirely failed to restrain, and, indeed, endeavoured to turn to account by acquiring fresh territory in violation of the Convention. In 1884, however, Her Majesty's Government yielded to representations of the Transvaal Government and granted a new Convention, which was signed in London on 27th February, 1884. By it fresh articles were substituted for the articles of the Pretoria Convention, a point which, as the reservation of suzerainty and grant of self-government to the Transvaal State both occur in the "preamble," or introduction of the Pretoria Convention, became of importance in the subsequent controversy regarding the status of the South African Republic, as the Transvaal State was now called.

The new Convention provided for the extension of the boundary of the Republic on the southwest, and abolished the British Resident and all direct control over native affairs. The Republic being bound, however, by Articles VIII. and XIX., to abstain from slavery and fulfil certain pledges made to the natives in 1881.

Article IV. ran as follows:—"The South African Republic will conclude no treaty or engagement with any State or nation other than the Orange Free State, nor with any native tribe to the eastward or westward of the Republic, until the same has been approved by Her Majesty the Queen.

"Such approval shall be considered to have been granted if Her Majesty's Government shall not, within six months after receiving a copy of such treaty (which shall be delivered to them immediately upon its completion), have notified that the conclusion of such treaty is in conflict with the interests of Great Britain or of any of Her Majesty's possessions in South Africa."

Article XIV. said that "all persons, other than natives, conforming themselves to the laws of the South African Republic (a) will have full liberty, with their families, to enter, travel, or reside in any part of the South African Republic; (b) they will be entitled to hire or possess houses, manufactories, warehouses, shops, and premises; (c) they may carry on their commerce either in person or by agents whom they may think fit to employ; (d) they will not be subject, in respect of their persons or property, or in respect of their commerce or industry, to any taxes, whether general or local, other than those which are or may be imposed upon citizens of the said Republic."

The concession of a larger degree of independence did not, however, prevent further trouble in Bechuanaland, while in Zululand adventurers from the Transvaal succeeded, by interfering in native disputes, in acquiring a large part of the country, where they formed a new State called the New Republic, the incorporation of which in the
South African Republic was ultimately allowed by Her Majesty's Government in 1888. A trek to the north into Rhodesia in 1890 was only prevented with difficulty; while the efforts of the Government of the Republic to extend its influence in Swaziland resulted in 1894 in the recognition by Her Majesty's Government of its protectorate over that country.

The Transvaal, which had been bankrupt in 1877, when it was annexed, remained for some years after the retrocession in great financial difficulties. From these, however, it was not only saved, but raised to an unprecedented height of prosperity by the development by immigrants, chiefly British subjects, of the gold industry on the Witwatersrand, which began to grow soon after the signature of the London Convention. The progress achieved is clearly reflected in the fact that the revenue of the Republic, which, in 1885, amounted to £77,877., had risen in 1890 to £229,061., reaching £329,958. in 1898. Unfortunately, the Republic, instead of welcoming the newcomers, who had thus increased the property of the country, adopted a repressive policy towards them. From 1890 to 1894 legislation was passed restricting the grant of the franchise, which at the time of the Pretoria Convention had been open to all settlers after a year's residence, and since 1882, after five years' residence, until it became practically unattainable to the ordinary immigrant. At the same time the abuses of the Administration, among which the Uitlander population especially reckoned the grant of concessions and monopolies, and against one of which, the dynamite monopoly, Her Majesty's Government entered in 1899 a special protest, created much discontent among the new population.

In 1894 the discontent assumed a threatening aspect, owing to the commandeering of British subjects to fight in a native war, but this question was arranged by the High Commissioner, Lord Loch, who visited Pretoria at that time; other questions, however, remained unsettled. In 1895 the action of the Government of the South African Republic in closing the drifts by which trade entered the Transvaal from the Cape, brought the Republic to the verge of war with Great Britain. Towards the end of 1895, a revolutionary movement was set on foot in Johannesburg. On the 29th of December, however, Dr. Jameson crossed the border of the Transvaal on his disastrous raid, and was defeated, and surrendered at Krugersdorp on the 2nd January, 1896. The High Commissioner, Sir Hercules Robinson, hurried to Pretoria, and by his inter-mediation Johannesburg laid down its arms.

President Kruger, at the time of the raid, had issued Proclamations promising to consider the redress of grievances, and laying down the principle, "Forget and Forgive." Little result, however, beyond the erection of an unsatisfactory municipality, followed his promises of reform; while the action of the Government of the Republic in disregarding the London Convention gave rise to questions with Her Majesty's Government. In addition to infringing Art. IV., the Republic passed in 1896 an Aliens' Immigration Restriction Law, which Her Majesty's Government contended was in violation of Art. XIV., and the law was repealed next year.

In 1897 the Government, in consequence of the complaints of the mining industry, appointed a commission of inquiry, whose report showed clearly the existence of very serious maladministration. Little or no reform, however, resulted.

The dissatisfaction which the Uitlanders manifested with the treatment which they received was brought to a high pitch by the shooting of an Englishman named Edgar by a policeman at Johannesburg on the 18th of December, 1898, and the action of the authorities in the matter, followed by the acquittal of the accused, aroused great excitement on the Rand—and, indeed, throughout the English-speaking part of South Africa. A petition, signed by 21,000 British subjects, calling attention to the grievances of the Uitlanders, and asking for the protection of Her Majesty's Government, was addressed to the Queen in March, 1899. The Government of the South African Republic at this time appeared to recognise the need for reform by proposing some slight alterations in the franchise law, but their negotiations, conducted with some of the leaders of the mining industry, broke down because the latter insisted that the Uitlander population generally must be consulted, and the Government repudiated responsibility for their negotiators. Her Majesty's Government, in a despatch dated 10th May, represented the grievances of the Uitlanders to the Government of the South African Republic, and urged that they should be redressed, proposing a conference between the High Commissioner and the President. Before, however, the despatch was presented, Sir A. Milner, on the invitation of the President of the Orange Free State, met President Kruger at Bloemfontein on the 31st of May, and proposed the grant of the franchise to the Uitlanders to relieve the situation. The proposals of the President were quite inadequate for the purpose of giving any substantial and immediate representation, and it being therefore useless, in Sir A. Milner's opinion, to discuss other outstanding questions, the Conference broke up on the 5th of June.

After successive proposals, and after Her Majesty's Government had asked that, if these proposals were to form any element in the settlement of differences between the two Governments, full particulars might be furnished, a franchise law, giving a seven years' retrospective franchise, was passed by the Volksraad without reference to Her Majesty's Government, and came into operation on 26th July. This law was an improvement on any previous proposal, but there was good ground for doubting whether it did not contain many provisions which would render it illusory in actual practice, and Her Majesty's Government, therefore, in a despatch of the 27th July, a summary of which was telegraphed on the same day to the High Commissioner, proposed a joint inquiry as to whether it would give "immediate and substantial representation." A note based on this proposal was communicated to the South African Republic on the 2nd August, but the Government of the Republic were extremely unwilling to accept the joint inquiry, and an alternative proposal for a five years' franchise was made in August by the State Attorney, Mr. Smuts, to Her Majesty's Agent, Mr. Greene, on three assumptions. These assumptions were (1) that Her Majesty's Government would not in future interfere in the internal affairs of the Republic; (2) that Her Majesty's Government would not insist further upon the assertion of suzerainty, the controversy being allowed tacitly to drop (this point had acquired special importance since the South African Republic, on the 9th May, had claimed the status of a sovereign international state); (3) that arbitration without a foreign element should be conceded.

The proposal was put forward in writing by the Republic in notes dated the 19th and 21st August, and the three "assumptions" were put forward as
express conditions. To these notes Her Majesty's Government replied, on the 28th August, that they could not bind themselves never to intervene again, but they expressed the hope that further intervention would be unnecessary if the franchise was granted. As to suzerainty they referred to their despatch in which they had intimated their refusal to continue the discussion; and as to arbitration, they agreed to discuss the form of a tribunal. The South African Republic, thereupon, in notes of the 1st and 2nd September, withdrew their five years' offer, and officially declared their objections to the joint inquiry, which they represented was an interference with the independence of the country. Her Majesty's Government then (8th September), being convinced by accumulating evidence of the unworkable character of the law which had been passed, while maintaining their position as regards interference and suzerainty, declared that they would be satisfied with a franchise on the five years' basis if shown by an inquiry, either unilateral or joint, not to be encumbered with impossible conditions. If this was acceded to they were ready to have a conference about arbitration, etc., but, failing acceptance, they would have to formulate their own proposals for a final settlement. To this the Government of the Republic replied by maintaining their withdrawal of the five years' franchise unless accepted with the conditions above stated, and called on Her Majesty's Government to revert to the proposal for a Joint Commission on the seven years' franchise. On the 22nd of September Her Majesty's Government repeated their views, and stated that their own proposals for a settlement would be formulated later.

After some correspondence between the President of the Orange Free State and the High Commissioner, in which the High Commissioner, as late as the 5th of October, said that any definite proposal would still be considered, the South African Republic, without waiting for Her Majesty's Government to formulate their proposals, handed to the British Agent an ultimatum, dated 9th October, requiring the instant withdrawal of British troops on the borders of the Republic, and the removal of all reinforcements which had arrived in South Africa since the 1st of June, and demanding an answer by five o'clock on the 11th of October. It was deemed impossible by Her Majesty's Government to discuss such a demand, and war broke out accordingly. The Orange Free State, in pursuance of a resolution passed on the 27th of September, threw its lot with the Transvaal.

A great exodus from the Rand had begun some time before the actual outbreak of war, the Government of the Republic having been commandeering and making other preparations for war, and so much distress resulted from the crowding of thousands of homeless refugees into the British Colonies that relief funds were started in this country.

On the outbreak of war, the Boers immediately invaded British territory to the south-east and west of the Republics. The operations on the western side were chiefly concerned with the investment of Mafeking and Kimberley. Meantime the main body of the Boers invaded Natal under General Joubert. The first considerable engagement of the war occurred at Dundee on the 20th of October, where General Symons attacked and repulsed a Boer commando. On the 21st of October the British army at Ladysmith attacked a Boer commando at Elandslagte, and inflicted a severe defeat. On the 30th Sir G. White made a reconnaissance from Ladysmith, and during the engagement which then took place two battalions and a mountain battery were cut off and captured by the Boers. Ladysmith was then surrounded by the Boers and communication cut. On the 3rd of November Colenso was evacuated, and the garrison there fell back on Estcourt.

Meanwhile troops were on the way from England. The Governments of Canada and of all the Australian Colonies offered the services of contingents, and the offer was gratefully accepted; the despatch of troops from the different colonies was rapidly organised, and they left amidst enthusiastic demonstrations of loyalty. Offers of troops were also made by several of the Crown Colonies, and by the Federated Malay States, and contingents of mounted Volunteers were accepted from India and Ceylon.

As the troops from England arrived, a move forward was made in two directions. A Natal relief column prepared for an advance to the relief of Ladysmith. Sir Redvers Buller, who was in chief command of the British forces, left Capetown for Natal to direct the general plan of advance, and by the end of November the British forces had arrived near Colenso. On December 15th, Sir R. Buller made an attack on the enemy and attempted to cross the Tugela at Colenso, but he had to retire to his camp at Chieveley after suffering severely in casualties and abandoning a large number of guns. On the western side a force under Lord Methuen pushed up along the railway to the relief of Kimberley. On the 23rd of November he attacked the Boers at Belmont and dispersed them. Two days later he pushed aside a further force at Enslin, and on the 28th November he forced a large body of the enemy to evacuate a strong position at the Modder River. He was then delayed for some days whilst the bridge over the Modder was being reconstructed and reinforcements and stores sent up to him. On December 11th he attacked the enemy at Magersfontein, but was unsuccessful in carrying the position, and fell back on the Modder River. The losses in the engagement were heavy.

The northern borders of Cape Colony, where there were a few British garrisons, were invaded by parties of Orange Free State Boers, with the apparent object of gaining recruits from the Dutch residents in the Colony, in which they were partially successful. General Gatacre, on his arrival, took command of the British troops in these districts. His first important action took place on the 10th of December, when he was unsuccessful in a night attack on Stormberg, having to retire with the loss of over 600 men captured.

On the receipt of news of the capture of the battalions at Ladysmith orders were at once given for the despatch of further reinforcements from England. The repulses experienced early in December made it necessary to take further measures. On the 7th of the month it was announced that Field-Marshal Lord Roberts would go out to take supreme command at the Cape, leaving Sir R. Buller to confine his attention to the operations in Natal; Lord Kitchener was appointed Chief of the Staff to Lord Roberts. Large reinforcements were ordered out from England, and further help offered by Australia and Canada was gladly accepted.

Lord Roberts reached Modder River on 9th February, 1900, and General French relieved Kimberley on the 16th. General Cronje was caught up and surrendered with all his force on the 27th. Ladysmith, after two unsuccessful attempts, was relieved by General Buller on the 28th of the same month. Lord Roberts reached Bloemfontein on the 13th of March, and Pretoria on the 5th of June.
The Transvaal was annexed to Her Majesty's dominions by a Proclamation which Lord Roberts issued at Belfast on the 1st of September, 1900, Lord Roberts becoming Administrator, in which office he was succeeded on his departure from South Africa at the end of the year by Sir Alfred Milner. The intention of Her Majesty's Government with regard to the future Constitution of the Colony was outlined in Mr Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons on December 7th, 1900. Sir A. Milner (now Lord Milner) was selected for the post of Governor of the Transvaal and of the Orange River Colony, an office which he combined with that of High Commissioner for South Africa.

The Transvaal Colony remained the scene of military operations till May, 1902, when on the last day of that month Articles of Peace were signed on behalf of the Governments concerned. The document was as follows:

"Army Headquarters, South Africa.

General Lord Kitchener of Khartoum, Commanding-in-Chief, and His Excellency Lord Milner, High Commissioner, on behalf of the British Government, and Messrs. S. W. Burger, F. W. Reitz, Louis Botha, J. H. De la Rey, L. J. Meyer, and J. C. Krogh, acting as the Government of the South African Republic, and Messrs. C. R. de Wet, W. J. C. Brebner, J. B. M. Hertzog, and C. H. Olivier, acting as the Government of the Orange Free State, on behalf of their respective burghers, desirous to terminate the present hostilities, agree on the following Articles:

1. The Burgher forces in the field will forthwith lay down their arms, handing over all guns, rifles, and munitions of war, in their possession or under their control, and desist from any further resistance to the authority of His Majesty King Edward VII., whom they recognise as their lawful Sovereign.

The manner and details of this surrender will be arranged between Lord Kitchener and Commandant-General Botha, Assistant Commandant-General De la Rey, and Chief Commandant De Wet.

2. Burghers in the field outside the limits of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony, and all prisoners of war at present outside South Africa who are burghers, will, on duly declaring their acceptance of the position of subjects of His Majesty King Edward VII., be gradually brought back to their homes as soon as transport can be provided and their means of subsistence ensured.

3. The burghers so surrendering or so returning will not be deprived of their personal liberty or their property.

4. No proceedings, civil or criminal, will be taken against any of the burghers so surrendering or so returning for any acts in connection with the prosecution of the war. The benefit of this Clause will not extend to certain acts contrary to the usage of war which have been notified by the Commander-in-Chief to the Boer Generals, and which shall be tried by court-martial immediately after the close of hostilities.

5. The Dutch language will be taught in public schools in the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony where the parents of the children desire it, and will be allowed in courts of law when necessary for the better and more effectual administration of justice.

6. The possession of rifles will be allowed in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony to persons requiring them for their protection, on taking out a license according to law.

7. Military administration in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony will at the earliest possible date be succeeded by civil government, and, as soon as circumstances permit, representative institutions, leading up to self-government, will be introduced.

8. The question of granting the franchise to natives will not be decided until after the introduction of self-government.

9. No special tax will be imposed on landed property in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony to defray the expenses of the war.

10. As soon as conditions permit, a Commission, on which the local inhabitants will be represented, will be appointed in each district of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony, under the presidency of a magistrate or other official, for the purpose of assisting the restoration of the people to their homes and supplying those who, owing to war losses, are unable to provide for themselves, with food, shelter, and the necessary amount of seed, stock, implements, etc., indispensable to the resumption of their normal conditions.

His Majesty's Government will place at the disposal of these Commissions a sum of three million pounds sterling for the above purposes, and will allow all notes, issued under Law No. 1 of 1900, of the Government of the South African Republic, and all receipts given by the officers in the field of the late Republics or under their orders, to be presented to a Judicial Commission which will be appointed by the Government, and if such notes and receipts are found by this Commission to have been duly issued in return for valuable consideration, they will be received by the first-named Commissions as evidence of war losses suffered by the persons to whom they were originally given. In addition to the above-named free grant of three million pounds, His Majesty's Government will be prepared to make advances as loans for the same purpose, free of interest for two years, and afterwards repayable over a period of years, with three per cent. interest. No foreigner or rebel will be entitled to the benefit of this Clause.

Signed at Pretoria this thirty-first day of May in the year of Our Lord one thousand nine hundred and two.

Prior to this, the Civil Administration was partly organised on a provisional basis, resident magistrates and district Commissioners having been appointed in many districts. Numerous proclamations were issued to provide for administrative requirements, and amongst those issued in 1902 may be mentioned those making provision for the acquisition
of lands for public purposes (Proclamation 7), placing subsidised schools under the control of the Director of Education (9), amending the law relating to the registration of deeds (10), levying a tax of 10 per cent. on the annual net produce of gold-bearing produce (34), regulating the registration of mining rights (35, amended by Ordinance 6 of 1902), and several relating to the administration of justice. On the 21st of June, 1902, Letters Patent were published constituting the Government of the Transvaal, and providing for an Executive and a Legislative Council, the members of which are to be appointed by the Crown; the subsequent legislation being accordingly by Ordinance.

On the 31st March, 1905, Letters Patent were passed providing for the constitution of a Legislative Assembly to consist of the Lieut.-Governor and not less than six or more than nine official members, and (provisionally) not less than thirty or more than thirty-five elected members. But in December, 1906, this Constitution was revoked and a new one substituted.

On 6th December, 1906, Letters Patent were issued conferring full responsible government upon the Transvaal. The legislature consisted of two chambers, the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly, the former containing fifteen members and the latter sixty-nine.

The Transvaal was included as an original Province of the Union of South Africa in terms of the South Africa Act, 1909, which came into operation on the 31st May, 1910, and is now governed under that Act. Apart from the general control of the Parliament of the Union, the control of certain matters specified in the South Africa Act is vested in an Administrator and Provincial Council.

**Local Government.**

The administration of municipal institutions in the Transvaal is now, by virtue of sec. 85 of the South Africa Act, 1909, vested in the Provincial Council, and all powers, authorities and functions relating to such institutions which at the establishment of the Union of South Africa were vested in or exercised by the Governor or the Governor in Council, or the Colonial Secretary of the late Colony of the Transvaal, are by sec. 81 of that Act vested in the Executive Committee of the Province.

Municipal Government was established in the principal towns of the Province by Ordinances enacted in 1903. These Ordinances have been extended and amended during the years 1904-1909 inclusive, and delegate to the local authorities very extensive powers. The Provincial Administration retains some measure of control, limited however to powers of audit and surcharge, also approval of loan proposals, local improvement schemes and the alienation of municipal property. Thirty-seven municipalities have been established, and considerable progress in the improvement of the towns has been made.

The basis of the municipal franchise is ownership of rateable property of the assessed value of £100, or the occupation of rateable property of the assessed value of £300, or of premises of the gross annual value of £24, but this franchise is not extended to aliens or to coloured British subjects.

The election of councillors of the various municipalities is by ballot, and in all the larger towns the procedure followed is based on the lines prescribed for municipal elections by the English Acts of Parliament. In the municipalities of Pretoria and Johannesburg the principle of proportional representation has been applied to the elections of councillors by Act No. 23 of 1909, the system used being commonly known as that of the "single transferable vote."

Legislation as enacted in 1905 and 1906 provides for the creation of Health Committees, where the density of population makes it necessary in semi-urban areas for sanitary measures to be enforced. Six of these committees have been established.

The Commission appointed in June, 1904, to enquire into the financial relations between the Central Government and Municipal Authorities has completed an exhaustive survey of the important subjects which were referred for its consideration and effect has already been given by Responsible Government to the majority of the Commission's recommendations.

There is no system of local government for rural districts such as the system of Divisional Councils which obtains in other Provinces of the Union. Magistrates deal administratively with a number of matters which in other Provinces are administered by bodies popularly elected. Under Responsible Government, however, local Boards were created to assist the then existing Government in administering education matters, maintenance of roads, regulation of water in public streams and prevention of cattle disease. These Boards still exist under the Union, and are responsible, according to their functions, either to the Union Government or the Provincial Administration. Field cornets, who assist the magistrates in the administration of laws in the magisterial districts, were also introduced by Responsible Government in the local administration of the country districts, and are still so employed.

Mining.

The Transvaal Province of the Union stands at the head of the gold-producing countries of the world. The production, which in 1887 amounted to a value of 169,401£., rose steadily until 1898, when it reached a value of 16,240,630£. The following are the values for recent years:

| Year | Ounces   | £       |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1903 | 2,972,897| 12,628,057|
| 1904 | 3,773,517| 16,028,883|
| 1905 | 4,909,541| 20,854,440|
| 1906 | 5,792,823| 24,606,336|
| 1907 | 6,450,740| 27,400,992|
| 1908 | 7,066,266| 29,973,115|
| 1909 | 7,295,108| 30,987,650|
| 1910 |          | 32,002,912|

The total output of the Transvaal from 1884 to June, 1910, was valued at 273,559,758£. Almost the whole production is from reef, the alluvial gold being inconsiderable in amount.

In 1897 the average number of persons employed by gold mines was 9,530 whites and 69,127 natives. These numbers rose to 12,000 and 107,000 just before the war in 1899, but then fell to about 10,000 and 45,000 in December, 1902. In June, 1910, the whites numbered 24,798 and the natives 201,806. The wages in June, 1910 were from about 10s. to 25s. per shift for skilled white workmen (contractors earning up to 45s. per shift) and 46s. monthly for natives; the latter are also provided with housing and food.

Chinese labourers were imported under an Ordinance (17 of 1904) passed in February, 1904. At the end of 1905 the further issue of licences for the importation of these labourers was arrested by His Majesty's Government, and subsequently, on the promulgation of the Transvaal Letters Patent, provision was made for the repatriation of all Chinese labourers on the expiration of their contracts. The first batch of Chinese to be repatriated in terms of this condition left the country at the end of June, 1907. The month of January, 1907, shows the highest number (viz., 53,856) of Chinese in the employ of mines. The last shipment of repatriated Chinese took place in March, 1910.

During the year ended 30th June, 1910, the Transvaal produced copper ore value 71,914£.; tin ore, 303,210£.; lead, 5,943£.; lime, 103,435£.; other base minerals, 47,358£.; and the value of miscellaneous articles (such as cement, machine made bricks and pottery) was 347,284£. The silver contained in the gold bullion exported and base metal ores was valued at 86,323£.

The total value of the diamonds produced in the Transvaal since the war is as follows:

| Year | £       |
|------|---------|
| 1901-2 | 1,199   |
| 1902-3 | 46,358  |
| 1903-4 | 688,720 |
| 1904-5 | 1,198,530|
| 1905-6 | 968,229 |
| 1906-7 | 2,203,511|
| 1907-8 | 1,879,551|
| 1908-9 | 1,295,296|
| 1909-10| 1,317,479|

The Premier (Transvaal) Diamond Mining Company accounts for almost the whole of the above production, and still maintains its position as one of the largest producers of the world.

The output of coal for the year ended 30th June, 1909, was 3,312,413 tons, value 851,150£.

The output of coal for the year ended 30th June, 1910, was 3,876,764 tons, value 970,367£.

Finances.

The accounts of the Colony begin practically with the year 1902-3, and relate to annual periods between the 1st July and 30th June.

The loan of 35,000,000£., raised in the year 1903, under a guarantee from the Imperial Government and under the authority of the Transvaal Guaranteed Loan Ordinance 1903, bearing interest at the rate of 3% per annum and with a sinking fund of 1% per annum, was allocated in terms of the Transvaal Inter-Colonial Conventions Ratification Act, 1908, between the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony in the following manner:

| Colony         | £       |
|----------------|---------|
| Transvaal      | 273,175,592|
| Orange River Colony | 7,682,408|
| Total          | 35,000,000|

The Transvaal portion has again been divided as between the Transvaal Government and the Central South African Railways Administration into two portions, namely, 12,834,716£. and 14,482,876£.

The interest, redemption and management charges on the first-mentioned amounts for the year 1909-10 were as follows:

| Item             | £       |
|------------------|---------|
| Interest         | 384,397 |
| Redemption       | 128,134 |
| Management       | 3,222   |

As regards the Central South African Railways portion the charges above-mentioned were 435,125£., 145,042£. and 3,630£.

As regards the loan of 5,000,000£., also under an Imperial guarantee, and for which power to raise is contained in the Transvaal Guaranteed Loan Act, 1907, the total amount has now been raised. This loan also bears interest at the rate of 3% per annum, and has a sinking fund of 1% per annum.

The money so raised has been allocated for such purposes as the Land and Agricultural Bank, Railways, Public Works and General Agricultural Development and Settlement.

### HIGH COMMISSION

The office of High Commissioner in and for South Africa was created by Letters Patent in 1878. In 1879 a second High Commissioner was appointed, to whom was assigned South-Eastern Africa, including Zululand and Amatongaland; but this arrangement ceased in 1881, when a Special Commissioner for Zulu affairs was appointed, who was also Governor of Natal (which now includes Zululand and Amatongaland). The High Commissioner for South Africa, who, under the Commission of 1889, was the officer for the time being administering the Government of the Cape, represents the Crown in all matters occurring in South Africa beyond the limits of the Colonies properly so called. He was, till 1899, charged with the conduct of British relations with the South African Republic (Transvaal) and the Orange Free State, as well as those with native...
states and tribes outside the Colonies of the Cape and Natal, including Swaziland, which was administered by the Government of the South African Republic under the Convention of 1894.

The High Commissioner is Governor of Basutoland, supervises the affairs of the Bechuanaland Protectorate and of Swaziland, and exercises the control provided by Order in Council over the Administration of the British South Africa Company in Southern North-Western and North-Eastern Rhodesia. The Southern Rhodesia Order in Council, 1898, provides for a control by the High Commissioner over legislation, important appointments, and Native affairs in Rhodesia, and for the appointment of a Resident Commissioner, who is paid from Imperial funds and acts as the local representative of the High Commissioner and the Imperial Government. The office of High Commissioner, which was formerly held by the Governor of Cape Colony, was, by a Commission dated Oct. 6th, 1900, vested in Lord Milner, by a similar Commission, dated March 15th, 1905, in Lord Selborne, and by a similar Commission, dated March 30th, 1910, in Lord Gladstone, who is also Governor-General of the Union of South Africa.
