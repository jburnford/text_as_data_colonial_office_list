ST. VINCENT.

Situation and Area.

The Island of St. Vincent is popularly supposed to have been discovered by Columbus on the 22nd of January, 1498. It is situated in 13° 10' N. latitude, and 60° 57' W. longitude, at a distance of 21 miles to the south-west of St. Lucia, and 100 miles west of Barbados. It is 18 miles in length, and 11 in breadth, and contains about 85,000 acres of land, about half the area of Middlesex. Most of the Grenadines, a chain of small islands lying between Grenada and St. Vincent, are comprised within the government of the latter island. The principal is Bequia, situated at a distance of 9 miles from Kingstown.

General Description.

Kingstown, the capital of St. Vincent, is situated at the side of an extensive bay, at the south-western extremity of the island. It consists of three principal streets, each about a mile long, running parallel with the beach, and contains a population of about 4,000 souls. It is a port of registry, and had, on 31st December, 1909, 32 vessels, of 602 tons.

There are five other small towns in the island, the most important being Georgetown on the north-east, and Chateaubelair on the north-west. The most striking natural feature of the island is its "Soufrière," or volcano, hitherto celebrated for the violence of its eruption in 1812. This mountain is situated at the northern extremity of the island, and rises to about 4,048 feet above the level of the sea. After remaining dormant for a period of ninety years, it broke into violent eruption again on May 7th, 1902, when the entire northern half of the island was devastated, and nearly 2,000 lives were lost. The eruption synchronised with that of Mont Pelée in Martinique which destroyed the town of St. Pierre. The "Soufrière" remained intermittently active throughout 1902, and there was a further eruption in March, 1903, since when it has remained quiescent.

The whole island is of volcanic origin. A backbone of densely wooded and almost impassable mountains traverses it from the "Soufrière" at its northern end to Mount St. Andrew (2,500 ft.), dominating the Kingstown valley at its southern extremity. This range sends off spurs on each side, cutting up the island into a series of valleys, trending east and west from the central range to the coast. There is a somewhat level tract called the Carib Country at the north-east of the island, between the "Soufrière" and the sea. This district, which formerly comprised the most fertile sugar estates, suffered very severely from the eruptions of 1902-03. The next highest point after the "Soufrière" in the range is Richmond Peak, 3,539 feet high. The streams are numerous but small, except after heavy rains; the principal is the Richmond River.

In September, 1898, the island was visited by a severe hurricane, which caused widespread destruction, and reduced large numbers of the inhabitants to destitution. St. Lucia and Barbados also suffered from this storm, but in lesser degree.

Climate.

In the dry season, December to June, the climate is charming. In the wet season, and especially from August to November, the climate is damp and hot, but not at all unhealthy, and fever is almost unknown. The nights are cool all the year round. The average rainfall for the last 15 years is 106.27 inches. The highest reading of the thermometer during 1909-10 was 80.4°F. and the lowest 74.6°F., the mean monthly temperature being 77.2°F. in the shade. The prevailing wind is N.E.

Industry and Communications.

Sugar, rum, cocoa, and excellent arrowroot are produced. The cultivation of ground nuts and spices is also attracting attention, and cotton is now extensively planted, for the ginning of which a Government factory has been erected. Most of the sugar and all the arrowroot mills are worked by water power. A large proportion of the cultivable land is owned by a few individuals; portions of Crown lands, which hitherto remained uncultivated, are in process of alienation to peasant proprietors, and several estates have recently been purchased by the Government with the aid of an Imperial grant, and are being allotted to the same class of settlers. The forests produce excellent woods. There are 59 miles of highway running round the island, for the most part close to the coast, but on the leeward coast communication is mainly by boat, and nearly all the produce is water borne.

The port of Kingstown is visited by the Royal Mail and the Canadian Mail Steamers fortnightly; the steamers of the Quebec Steamship Company, an American Line, also call.

A telephone system has been established, having 1 central and 7 branch exchanges, with about 114 connections and some 150 miles of line.

History.

At the time of its discovery, St. Vincent, like some of the other small islands, was inhabited by the Caribs, who continued in the undisputed possession of it until 1627, when the King of England made a grant of the island to the Earl of Carlisle. In 1660 it was declared neutral, and in 1672 it was granted to Lord Willoughby.

No steps, however, appear to have been taken to form a settlement on the island, and the English and French came to an agreement to abandon the Islands of Dominica and St. Vincent to the Caribs, on condition of their renouncing all claim to the other islands.

In 1722 George I. made a grant to the Duke of Montague of some of the West India Islands, including St. Vincent.

From statistics of the year 1740 it appears that the white inhabitants then amounted to about 800, and the slaves to 3,000, producing commodities for exportation to the value of £2,625.

In 1748 St. Vincent was declared neutral by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. In 1756, however, hostilities were renewed, and the island was taken in 1762 by General Monckton; and by the Treaty of Paris in the following year it was ceded to Great Britain, when General Melville was appointed Governor.

By a treaty, which was concluded in February, 1773, an extensive district of St. Vincent was allotted to the Caribs (who for some time had been in a state of open rebellion) on condition of their laying down their arms and
acknowledging the King of Great Britain as the rightful sovereign of the island.

In 1779 the island surrendered to the French. The following year has been rendered memorable by the occurrence of the greatest hurricane of which there is any record in West Indian annals. By the Treaty of Versailles in 1783, St. Vincent was restored to Great Britain.

From this period to the breaking out of the French Revolution the island appears to have enjoyed comparative prosperity and peace; but in 1795 the Caribs and their allies (the French) again overran the country, burning the cane-fields, plundering the houses, and mercilessly murdering the English colonists. This state of things continued till the arrival of the "Zebra" sloop of war, with succours from Martinique, then the British headquarters.

The contest was carried on, with alternations of good and ill fortune, until the arrival of Sir Ralph Abercrombie with reinforcements in June, 1796. After an obstinate struggle the insurgents surrendered at discretion. The Government, in anticipation of such an event, had resolved that the Caribs should be transported to the Island of Ruatan, in the Bay of Honduras; and accordingly, on the 11th March, 1797, the necessary transports having been provided, the Caribs, to the number of 5,080, were embarked at Bequia, and sailed for their appointed destination.

In 1834 the apprenticeship system was established, and was followed in 1838 by unconditional emancipation of the negro slaves. The year 1846 witnessed the first introduction of Portuguese labourers, a class of immigrants who amounted in a few years to 2,400, and have proved a valuable addition to the general population of the island.

St. Vincent received its first cargo of East Indian Coolie labourers in 1861. The indentures of these immigrants have expired, and most of them have returned to India. Some, however, have made their home in the Colony.

**Constitution.**

The Government of St. Vincent originally consisted of a Governor, Council, and Assembly.

The Council consisted of twelve members, one half of whom were named in the Governor's Commission, and the remainder appointed on his recommendation. The Assembly was composed of nineteen members, including two for the Grenadines. In 1856 an Executive Council was created, consisting of ten members, five from the Legislative Council, and five from the Assembly. In 1859 this Council was re-modelled, with the addition of an Administrative Committee, selected by the Governor and composed of three members—one from the Legislative Council, and two from the Assembly. This Act of 1859 had, however, a duration of only five years.

The constitution, however, was found no longer suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony, and in 1867 the Legislative Council and House of Assembly were abrogated, and a single Legislative Assembly was created instead thereof. This Assembly was composed of 12 members, viz.:—three *ex officio*, three nominated by the Crown, and six elected by the people. (The number of electors registered for the year 1874 was only 388.)

But this constitution also was abrogated by an Act of the Local Legislature (confirmed by an Imperial Act, 39 & 40 Vict. c. 47), by which the future modelling of the constitution was left to the Crown. The Legislative Council now consists of official and unofficial members nominated and appointed by the Crown.

The several courts of the Colony were, by an Ordinance of the Local Legislature passed in 1880, consolidated into one court, styled the Supreme Court of Judicature. The Chief Justice of the Colony is the sole Judge of this court.

There were, at the time of the annual inspection in 1910, 27 schools, with 4,586 children on the rolls, and an average attendance of 2,223. There is also a government agricultural school, opened in 1900, and a secondary school for boys, opened in 1908.

The Government expenditure on education in 1909-10 was £1,479.

A savings bank was established in 1866, and had 1,063 depositors, with 13,869l. deposited, at 31st December, 1909. On 1st July, 1900, branches of the bank were opened at Georgetown and Chateau Belair.

APPENDIX TO PART II.

This Appendix gives some account of North Borneo, Sarawak and certain British Possessions and Protectorates which are not administered under the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

NORTH BORNEO.

Situation and Area.

The territory under the jurisdiction of the British North Borneo Company (incorporated by Royal Charter under date of 1st Nov., 1881), now known as "The State of North Borneo," comprises the whole of the northern portion of the island of Borneo from the Sipitong River on the west to lat. 4° 10' N. on the east coast, together with adjacent islands; it is held under grants from the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu, and contains an area of 31,000 square miles (equal to Scotland), with a coast line of about 900 miles. It extends from 115° 20' to 119° 20' E. long., and from 4° 10' to 7° 25' N. lat. The southern boundary was settled by a convention at London on the 20th June, 1891.

The principal stations of the Company are at Sandakan (where are also the headquarters of the administration), Lahat Datu, and Tawao, on the east, Kudat on the north, and Jesselton on the west. At each of these there are excellent harbours, especially at the first-named, which is situated in a magnificent bay some fifteen miles in length, with an average breadth of five miles. It is 1,000 miles from Singapore, 1,200 from Hong Kong, and 1,600 from Port Darwin. Inland stations are at Labuk, Kotabulud, Tuaran, Tambunan, Kaningau, Tenom, Beaufort, Tangkulap and Tomani.

General Description.

The greater part of the country is at present covered with jungle, but the soil is found to be well adapted for the growth of almost all tropical products, more particularly tobacco, sugar, coffee, sago, tapioca, pepper, rubber, etc.

The mineral resources of the country are now being fully investigated. Gold has been found in three of the rivers on the east coast; coal, manganese, and other minerals have also been met with, and are being worked.

The country is mountainous. The highest point yet discovered is Kinabalu, 13,700 feet.

The inhabitants, who are supposed to number about 150,000, are mainly Bruneis, Illanans, Bajaus, and Sulus on the coast, who subsist by fishing and trade; further back, the Dusuns cultivate yearly well-irrigated rice fields; and in the interior they plant tobacco and hill padi (rice), and hunt, clearing fresh jungle every year; the Muruts, another interior tribe, are very numerous and peaceable, occasionally varying more peaceful pursuits by head hunting raids on a petty scale.

There are Chinese settlements on the coast; they cultivate the flat areas, and carry on a considerable trade. There are 200 Europeans and 16,000 Chinese in the territory. Sandakan, the chief town with suburbs, has a population of 9,500. There are two missions, one the Church of England, with stations at Kudat and Jesselton and Beaufort, and one Roman Catholic, with a church and school at Sandakan and four stations on the West Coast. The former, which is supported by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and the Church of England Community, has a stone church and two schools at Sandakan and one at Jesselton. The Basel Mission also has schools at Kudat and Papar.

History.

The State and town of Brunei appear to have been prosperous from a very early age. They were visited by Europeans in 1322, 1503, and 1520, but the first settlement in Borneo was made by the Dutch at Landak and Sukadana in 1608, and soon abandoned. Two English settlements were made about 1609, and abandoned in 1623. The Dutch factories were re-established in 1747 and 1776, but finally given up in 1790.

A British settlement was formed under the East India Company in 1762, at the island of Balan-bangan, which had been ceded by the Sultan of Sulu. This was attacked by pirates in 1775, and the staff was removed to Labuan, a small factory being at the same time established at Brunei. A second attempt in 1803 was made to establish a settlement on the former island, and in Marudu Bay, and on its failure the East India Company gave up its connection with Northern Borneo.

Sir James Brooke, in 1842, established the independent State of Sarawak, which, as well as Brunei, is under the exclusive influence of Great Britain; and Labuan became a British Colony in 1846. Some Americans obtained extensive cessions in North Borneo in 1865 from the Sultan of Brunei, but they were never utilised. In 1872 a company, called the Labuan Trading Company, established itself in Sandakan, the business of which was later carried on by its manager, Mr. W. C. Cowie. Finally, in 1877 and 1878, the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu ceded to a syndicate formed by Baron Overbeck and Mr. (now Sir Alfred) Dent the greater portion of the territory now known as British North Borneo. This syndicate's rights were acquired in 1881 by the British North Borneo Provisional Association, and transferred by that body in 1882 to the British North Borneo Company. Some further cessions have since been added to the Company's territory. The British Government assumed a formal protectorate over the territory by agreement with "The State of North Borneo," dated the 12th May, 1888. By this agreement the State is to continue to be administered by the Company as an independent State, under the protection of Her Majesty's Government, who may appoint consular officers, and shall conduct all foreign relations, but does not interfere in internal administration.

Climate.

The climate, though tropical, is equable; the temperature varies from 70° to 90°, but there is usually a light breeze. The annual rainfall is from 80 to 120 inches, according to situation.
Industry.

Agriculture is now beyond its primitive state, and certain of the more advanced tribes use the plough and harrow. There is a large trade in the collection of jungle produce, and much attention has been given to the cultivation of tobacco and rubber, for which the soil and climate have proved to be eminently suited. The value of tobacco exported in 1908 was nearly three million dollars. Coconut plantations are rapidly increasing in number, and the export of coconuts and of copra is becoming of importance. The hill lands are well adapted for the cultivation of tapioca, gambier, pepper and tea. The enormous virgin forests of North Borneo have enabled a lucrative timber trade to be carried on with China and Manila, and inquiries for railway sleepers are now coming from various parts of the world. Sleepers have already been supplied to Manila, and it is believed that this trade can be largely developed. Shipbuilding is increasing in Sandakan Bay, where two large saw mills have been working for some years. A slipway carrying vessels up to 150 feet in length or a dead weight of 600 tons has been constructed. The Cutch factory is doing a considerable business, and another factory has been established in Marudu Bay. A soda water and ice manufactory is also operated in Sandakan.

The exports comprise also, sago, coffee, pepper, gutta-percha, indiarubber, rattans, beeswax, edible birds' nests, camphor, resin (called damar), cattle, cutch, &c., sent almost entirely to Singapore and China; from Singapore part of these find their way to Europe.

The Chartered Company does not itself engage in trade.

The revenue is derived from import and export duties, stamps, and royalties, a poll tax, licences for the sale of opium, spirits, and tobacco; and from the sale and rent of forest lands, suburban lots, and town sites.

Minerals.

Excellent coal is being worked by the Cowie Harbour Coal Company, and coal is being supplied to vessels at the principal North Borneo ports.

Large deposits of iron ore have been discovered. A syndicate has recently been formed for the working of the oil belts which have been discovered on the West Coast.

Currency and Banking.

The Company has a copper coinage of ½ and 1 cent pieces, a nickel coinage of 1 cent, 2½ cent, and 5 cent pieces, and it issues notes, expressed in dollars, to the extent of $500,000. The dollars in circulation are those of the Straits Settlements. There are agencies of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China, and the National Bank of China, and the Company itself does banking business when required.

Money orders on North Borneo are issued in England, India, the Straits Settlements, Ceylon, Hong Kong, and elsewhere, and vice versa, and British postal orders came into use in the State during 1908.

Constitution.

The territory is administered by a Court of Directors in London, appointed under the Royal Charter, and a Governor and Civil Service appointed by them. There are 10 provinces (Alcock, Cunliffe, Dent, Dewhurst, Elphinstone, Keppel, Martin, Mayne, Myburgh, and Clarke).

The appointment of the Governor is subject to the approval of the Secretary of State.

The law of the country is based on the Indian Penal, Criminal Procedure, and Civil Procedure Codes, with an adaptation in special instances of several of the Acts in force in the British Colonies, and an Imam's court, for the administration of Mohammedan law, with native courts for trials by local customs. There is a force of about 700 armed police under European officers.

Means of Communication.

Messrs. Behn Meyer & Co., on behalf of the Nord-Deutscher-Lloyd Company, run steamers constantly between Singapore and the local ports, and between Hong Kong and the ports. There is additional communication by steamer with Singapore and Hong Kong, and a local company runs a line along the coast and to adjacent islands. The Government have constructed a metre-gauge railway from Brunei Bay to Beaufort, 20 miles, and from Beaufort to Jesselton, 57 miles, and a line of 33 miles from Beaufort to Tenom, which will open up the interior. In all, the length of railway (including branches) completed is 120 miles. Its principal coastal terminus is Jesselton, at which port there is a steel jetty where vessels up to 2,000 tons can load and discharge cargo. Over 700 miles of telegraph line are open. Several riding roads already exist, and over 250 miles of bridle path have been constructed. Internal communication is mainly by water. The State has joined the Postal Union. Course of post from London, about thirty days. Postage to all British possessions for letters 4 cents per oz foreign countries, 10 cents.

On the completion of the Singapore—Labuan—Hong Kong cable in April, 1894, the mainland of Borneo was joined to Labuan by a cable covering a distance of about 10 miles to Mempakol. A telegraph line from that point to Sandakan is now constructed, and brings a number of inland stations into direct telegraphic communication with London.

A branch line from Beaufort, on the Padas River, to Kudat, on the west coast, is now open, and also a line from Lamag, on the Kinabatangan River, to Lahat Datoh. A line has also been constructed to link up the manganese mines at Tanjong Batu.

SARAWAK.

An agreement was entered into with the Rajah of Sarawak, on the north-west coast of Borneo, on the 14th of June, 1888, under which that State has been placed under British protection. Her Majesty's Government undertake not to interfere with the internal administration of the State, but they are to determine any questions that arise as to the succession, to control the foreign relations, and to have the right to establish consular officers in the territory. British subjects are to have most-favoured-nation treatment, and no part of the territory is to be alienated without the consent of H.M.'s Government.

The territory of Sarawak comprises an area of about 42,000 square miles (more than equal to Ireland and Wales together), with a population of about 500,000, composed of various races. It is intersected by many rivers, navigable for a considerable distance inland, and commands about 380 miles of coast line. The government of the district from Tanjong Datu to the entrance of the Samarahan River was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei in the year 1842 by Sir James Brooke, who became well known as Rajah Brooke, of Sarawak. In 1861 a second cession was obtained from the Sultan of Brunei of all the rivers and lands from the Samarahan River to Kadurong Point. In 1882 a third cession was obtained of 100 miles of coast line and all the country and rivers that lie between Kadurong Point and the Baram River, including about three miles of coast on the north-east side of the latter; and in 1885 another cession was obtained of the Trusan River, situated on the north of the mouth of the Brunei River. The Limbang River was also obtained in 1890, and the transfer was approved and confirmed by H.M.'s Government in August, 1891. The Lawas River was added in 1905. The present Rajah, H.H. Sir Charles Johnson Brooke, G.C.M.G. (born June, 1829; married 1869, Margaret Alice Lily de Winit), is a nephew of Sir James Brooke, to whom he succeeded in 1868.

Heir, Charles Vyner Brooke (Rajah Muda), born 26th September, 1874.

Products.

At Paku, in Upper Sarawak, a considerable number of Chinese are engaged in working gold, and also in the Batang Lupar Residency. Gold exported 1898, value $23,685; 1899, $841,711; 1900, $843,709; 1901, $1,424,170; 1902, $1,368,360 (and gold ore, $22,470); 1903, $1,784,600 (and gold ore, $26,380); 1904, $1,819,200 (and gold ore $36,395); 1905, $1,839,956 (and gold ore $42,590); 1906, $1,415,470; 1907, $1,513,800; 1908, $1,130,760. The Borneo Company possesses a monopoly of the mineral rights, other than gold and coal, over most of Sarawak, and at Busoh the Company have extensive antimony works, and have erected at Bau and Bidi large works for the treatment of gold ore by the cyanide process. Coal is mined on a considerable scale at Sadong and Brooketon, the output in 1909 being 35,996 tons, including the quantity used by the local steamers. There is a considerable export of timber, mostly from the Rejang River to Hong Kong, valued in 1902 at $188,445, in 1903 at $53,664, in 1904 at $63,226, in 1905 at $82,182, in 1906 at $58,073, in 1907 at $54,347, and in 1908 at $77,795. There are successful plantations of coffee on Matang, and pepper grows well throughout the Territory. All these articles figure in the list of exports, which also includes diamonds, quicksilver, gutta-percha, indiarubber, canes, rattans, camphor, bees' wax, birds' nests, sago, tapioca, gambier, and silver. The value of the principal exports in 1908 was: Gutta and india-rubber, $363,305; *Jelutong gutta, $203,346; rattans, $176,925; gambier, $106,856; pepper, $91,386; sago flour, $1,009,106; sago, pearl, $163; sago, raw, $7,178. The bulk of the trade is with Singapore.

Chief Towns.

Kuching, the capital, population about 25,000, on the Sarawak River, about 23 miles inland (N. lat. 1° 33' 10", E. long. 110° 20' 13"), besides excellent Government offices and Court House, possesses an excellent hospital, and a museum with a complete collection of exhibits relating to Borneo. The Bishop of Labuan and Sarawak has his headquarters there, and has a mission school with 100 scholars, and also a girls' school. The Roman Catholics also have a mission there, with a boys' school under two resident priests, and a girls' school under the sisters.

Sibu, on the Rejang River, has a large population of Chinese traders, who exchange European goods for jungle produce. The river has a native population estimated at 90,000. The Chinese here trade direct with Singapore, as well as with Kuching. Muka, a large town on the Muka River, near its mouth, is devoted to the production of sago, the stems of the sago palm being cut in the upper reaches of the river and floated down to the town, where the pith is extracted and beaten, to be carried in native schooners to Kuching, to be cleaned.

Other towns are Bintulu, Oya, Kapit, Baram Simanggang, Sadong, Trusan, Limbang, Lawes.

Communication

is maintained by the Sarawak and Singapore SS. Co. with Kuching and Singapore every week; by the "Kaka," 250 tons, "Adeh," 189 tons.

* Note.—Jelutong gutta is the sap of a fairly common jungle tree. It is said to be shipped mostly to America, and used in the manufacture of paint.
"Gladys," 173 tons, and "Sarawak," 46 tons, coasting, with trips to Singapore four or five times a year; and by the "Chamois," Government despatch steamer.

Communication is also kept up with coast stations by Government steam launches.

There are roads only around the capital and thence to the mining district in Upper Sarawak (about 25 miles); internal communication is entirely by means of the numerous rivers, which form natural highways and byways, by which any point in the country can be reached in steam launches or boats.

Postage.

Sarawak joined the Postal Union on 1st July, 1897.

Local.—To any place in the country, 2 cents per ½ oz., and 3 cents to Singapore. Inland postcards 1 cent.

Foreign.—The same as from Singapore (Sarawak stamps).

Since 1st July, 1897, letters come in direct bag from London, but via Singapore.

Sources of Revenue.

The principal sources of revenue are the opium, gambling, arrack, and pawn farms, producing $483,019 in 1908.

Harbour, buoy, and light dues:—Three cents per ton, payable on arrival, and chargeable to all vessels of five tons and upwards.

The taxes levied are:—Exemption, $2 per annum, payable by Malays; $1 per annum per door, payable by sea Dyaks; $2 per annum for every able-bodied land Dyak.

The total amount of Dyak and Malay Revenue for the year 1909 was $83,312.

The weights are, 1 picul = 133½ lbs.; 1 cogan = 2 tons 7 cwt. 2 qrs. 18 lbs.
