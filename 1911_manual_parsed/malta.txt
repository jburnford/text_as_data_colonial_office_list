MALTA.

Situation and Area.

The Maltese Islands form a group in the Mediterranean Sea, about 58 miles from the nearest point of Sicily, 80 miles from Syracuse, and 142 from Reggio, and about 130 from the nearest point of the mainland of Africa. The length of Malta is about 17 miles, by 9 miles in breadth; its area is 91,557 square miles; that of Gozo, 24,804 square miles, and that of Comino about one square mile. Filfla and Cominotto are mere islets. The whole group is about half the area of the Isle of Man.

History.

The earliest known inhabitants of the Maltese islands were the Phoenicians, who have left traces of their presence in the famous temples of Hagar Kine in Malta, and Torre dei Giganti, in Gozo, and Diodorus Siculus states that Malta (Melita) and Gozo (Gandus) were regarded as being among the most important and prosperous Phoenician colonies. Greeks also appear to have settled in the island at a very early date, and during the period of the struggles between the Greeks and the Carthaginians for the possession of Sicily, Malta probably shared the varying fortunes of its neighbour, but practically nothing is known of its history in these years. At the beginning of the Punic wars the islands were held by Carthage. In the course of the first Punic war they changed hands more than once, but at its conclusion they were still in the possession of the Carthaginians. In 218 B.C., they passed finally to Rome. Under the Romans Malta appears to have enjoyed great prosperity. Diodorus Siculus speaks of the excellence of its harbours, the wealth of its inhabitants, and its many skilful artificers, and refers to its fertility, and Cicero, in the Verrine orations, speaks of it as abounding in riches and famous for its textile manufactures. Inscriptions show that it enjoyed municipal rights in the time of Hadrian, but the most striking fact in its history which is known to us is that it was the scene of St. Paul's shipwreck (Acts xxviii.). On the final division of the Empire in 395 A.D., Malta fell to the share of the Byzantine Emperor, and for the next four centuries its history is almost a blank. In the 9th century it was three times invaded by the Arabs, who finally conquered it in 870, the Byzantine garrison being massacred in an insurrection of the inhabitants. The Arabs held the islands until 1090, when they were conquered by Count Roger de Hauteville. From that date until 1530, the history of Malta is that of Sicily. In 1530, the Emperor Charles V. granted the islands to the Order of St. John, who had been driven from Rhodes by the Turks, and for 268 years it remained under the dominion of the Knights. The most famous incident of this period is the great siege of 1565, when the Order under the leadership of the Grand Master La Valette, successfully resisted the attacks of the apparently overwhelming force which Solomon, the magnificent, sent against them. By the end of the 18th century the Order had fallen into decay, and on the 12th July, 1798, the Grand Master Hompesch capitulated without any attempt at resistance to Napoleon Bonaparte, who dispersed the Order. The Maltese, however, rose against the French, and drove them to take refuge in the towns, where they were closely blockaded by the British fleet, aided by the Maltese, for two years. The French, reduced to extremities, surrendered to the British, and in 1800 the government was placed in the hands of Great Britain. The Treaty of Amiens provided that the islands should be restored to the Knights, but this was prevented by the re-commencement of this war, and they were finally annexed to the British Crown by the Treaty of Paris in 1814.

Climate.

The climate of Malta is equable and very healthy in winter. In August the heat at the sea level approaches that experienced in the tropics. The nights, however, are pleasant and cool, except during the prevalence of the scirocco wind. The mean maximum temperature during the three coldest months (December, January, February) is 58°8 Fahr., and the mean minimum 50°6°; but during the four hottest months (June, July, August, and September) the mean maximum is 81°6° Fahr., and the mean minimum 70°6°. The mean temperature is 64°6°, and the mean annual rainfall is 20 inches. There is no river or rivulet in the island, the water drainage becoming absorbed in the porous sandstone beds and finding its way through underground channels and aqueducts.

Industry.

The island is highly cultivated. Besides products for home consumption, early potatoes, onions, cummin seed and oranges are exported. A large number of the inhabitants are employed in connection with the trade of Valletta as a coaling station and an entrepôt and port of call. It is a port of registry, having, on 31st December, 1909, 107 vessels, 5,013 gross tonnage. There is a large trade with Tunis, Tripoli, Algeria, Italy, and the Levant.

Chief Towns.

The chief town and capital is Valletta, having, with its suburbs of Floriana, Sliema, and St. Julian's, a population which, in 1901, was 40,406. The "Three Cities" (Senglea, Cospicua, and Vittoriosa) have a population of 17,492. Citta Vecchia, the old capital, is in the interior of the island, and, with its suburbs, had a population of 9,067 in 1901. The chief town of Gozo is Victoria (formerly called Rabat), with a population of about 5,000.

Inhabitants.

The inhabitants of the country districts resemble the southern Italians in appearance, and in some districts show distinct traces of their Punic descent. In the towns and among the upper classes are to be found representatives of families who have settled in Malta from many different countries. The Maltese dialect, which is generally spoken, is of Semitic origin, and is held to be derived from the Carthaginian and Arabic tongues. The educated and commercial classes also speak Italian and English. The Maltese are remarkably thrifty, hard-working, and industrious. They are excellent seamen and mechanics; large numbers of them are to be found in Algeria, Gibraltar, the Regency of Tunis, and Egypt.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency is, under Order in Council of September 24th, 1886, exclusively British. There are two local banks (Banco di Malta
and Anglo-Maltese Bank), and branches of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank and the Banco di Roma. The first two banks have a small note circulation, the amount of which cannot be ascertained, inasmuch as those banks are not subject to any statutory laws and do not publish their accounts. The Government savings bank was established in 1833. On 31st March, 1910, the deposits amounted to £538,608.

Means of Communication.

The railway, which is of the metre gauge, is 7¾ miles long; it was originally built by the Malta Railway Company at the cost of about 100,000L. The railway became the property of the Local Government in 1890, under a clause of the concession which provided that if the service was suspended for a certain period, the railway would be forfeited to the Government. An electric tramway and a motor-omnibus service were started in 1905, connecting the principal towns and some of the villages with Valletta. There is a telephone exchange with 742 miles of wires. Malta is a station of the Eastern Telegraph Company, with direct cables to Alexandria (3), Gibraltar (3), Bone (2), Messina (1), Tripoli (1), Sicily (1), and Zante (1).

Malta is a port of call for nearly all the Mediterranean lines of steamers, and is an important coaling station, facilities being given for coaling at any hour, day and night, and for ensuring full weight of bunker coals. There is direct mail communication with several Mediterranean ports and with England, via Italy, daily, except Sundays. The rates of postage are as follows:

Public Works.

The drainage of the fortified towns, which was commenced in 1876 at the joint charge of the Colonial and Imperial Treasuries, was completed in 1885, and has greatly improved their sanitary condition. New drainage works were commenced in 1899, and Sliema, St. Julians, Misida, Pietà, Hamrun, Curmi, Rabato and other places have been drained, while several works have been carried out under a scheme for flushing the whole drainage system of Malta with sea water. The waterworks have also been much improved, and have now been extended to all the large villages and to Gozo. Considerable progress has been made in public lighting, and in improving the roads and streets. Electric lighting has been installed, and current is supplied to Valletta, Floriana, Sliema, and the Three Cities, including the two harbours.

Constitution.

The Government is administered by a Governor, advised and assisted by an Executive Council, established in 1881, re-constituted in 1887, and again in 1903 and 1909. It now consists of eleven official and two unofficial members besides the President. Legislation is carried on by means of a partly-elective Council of Government originally constituted by Letters Patent of 11th May, 1849; re-constituted by Letters Patent of 12th Dec., 1887 (amended in 1898); and again by Letters Patent of 3rd June, 1903. It now consists of ten official members and eight elected, besides the President and a Vice-President. Public officers are ineligible for election, and no ecclesiastical person is capable of being elected a member of the Council. The islands are divided into eight electoral districts, returning one member each. The total number of electors is a little under 8,000. The qualifications for a member of Council are, his qualification to be registered as an elector, and the possession of immovable property of the clear value of 100L. for twelve calendar months previous to election; or the payment of rent for immovable property to the annual value of 10L. for twelve calendar months previous to election; or the payment of 40L. a year for board and lodging; or 10L. a year for his lodging only for the same period previous to election. The qualifications for an elector are the age of twenty-one years, British nationality, and either an income from immovable property of 6L. per annum, or the payment of rent to the amount of 6L. per annum for six calendar months before registration, or qualification to serve as a common juror. The Council of Government, unless sooner dissolved, lasts three years. The Governor is ex-officio President, but neither he, nor the Vice-President or other presiding member has either an original or a casting vote. A Vice-President was first appointed by Letters Patent, dated 6th February, 1893. The Governor, or the Vice-President, if present, may depute an official member to preside. There are no municipalities or other forms of local government.

Education and Religion.

Elementary education is carried on principally in Government schools, which are Roman Catholic and free. There are two secondary schools with 327 scholars, and 164 elementary and infants' schools, including 77 elementary schools and 35 infant departments, 3 technical schools, 1 Sunday school, 15 drawing (day and night) schools, and 33 night schools, with an average enrolment of 21,066 pupils, and an average attendance of 18,445 in both day and night schools. There is a public lyceum with

nearly 600 scholars, and a university (founded in 1769) with an average attendance of about 170 students. At these two latter institutions the fees are comparatively low, ranging from 30s. to 50s. per annum in the Lyceum, and not exceeding 60s. per annum for all lectures in the University. There are numerous private elementary and secondary schools. The total number of these schools is about 60, with an approximate attendance of 3,720 pupils. Education is not compulsory. The Roman Catholic religion is universal amongst the Maltese.

Revenue.

There is no direct taxation of any kind. The most important sources of revenue are the Customs duties, stamp duty, port dues, and land revenue.

Weights and Measures.

Malta barrel is equal to 94 imperial gallons.
" salm " 1 quarter.
" cantar " 175 lbs. English.
