FIJI.

Situation and Area.

The Colony of Fiji comprises all islands, rocks, and reefs lying between latitude 15° and 22° S., and between longitude 177° W. and 175° E. It is distant from Sydney about 1,900 miles, and from Auckland 1,200 miles. The Tongan or Friendly Islands lie 180 miles to the south-east, and Samoa 500 miles to the north-east. The French colony of New Caledonia lies to the westward about 700 miles. The number of islands has been variously stated at from 200 to 250; but this includes mere uninhabited rocks and islets.

The dependency of Rotumah consists of all islands, rocks, reefs between 12° and 15° S., and between 175° and 180° E.

The principal inhabited islands are Viti Levu, 4,112 square miles, Vanua Levu, 2,432 square miles, Tavuni, 217 square miles, Kadavu, 124 square miles, Koro, 58 square miles, Gau, 45 square miles, and Ovalau, 43 square miles. The total area of the Colony (including Rotumah, 14 square miles) is 7,435 square miles (about equal to Wales).

Physical Features.

The more important islands are hilly and mountainous, rising more or less abruptly from the shore to a height of about 4,000 or even 4,500 feet. The hills are generally of a grand and picturesque outline, being composed for the most part of old volcanic lavas. Upon the south-eastern or windward sides the islands are covered with dense forests. The lowerlands are more lightly timbered, and apparently have all been under cultivation at a not distant period when the native population was much larger. On these flats the soil is almost everywhere deep, easily worked, and especially rich in humic acid. The northern and north-western sides of the larger island, or leeward sides, are characterised by a comparative absence of forest lands; and here hills or plains are covered with long reeds or grass, and dotted with clumps of Casuarina and Pandanus.

Iron ore is found in considerable quantities, but is not worked. There are also traces of gold, silver (chloride), tin, antimony, manganese, and other metals.

The country is well watered. Frequent rains keep alive the sources of the thousands of small affluents feeding the main rivers. Of these rivers the Rewa stands first. It is navigable for boats, punts, or flat-bottomed steamers, for 40 or 50 miles from its mouth. Several large streams fall into it, the sources of which lie in the high mountains of the interior 3,000 or 4,000 feet above the level of the sea. Besides these, the Sigatoka, the Nadi, and Ba rivers, with many others, drain the principal watersheds of Viti Levu. In Vanua Levu the rivers are not so large, though they are nearly as numerous. The Dreketi river being first in size is navigable for craft of considerable size for a distance of 15 miles from its mouth. Almost every valley in the group has its stream or brook, from which the native occupants irrigate their plantations of "dalo" (Calocasia esculenta).

Fiji is as rich in harbours and roadsteads as it is in rivers. Each island is surrounded by a barrier reef, and, with few exceptions, is accessible through passages usually found opposite to the most considerable valley or river. Between this river and the shore ships lie safely at anchor, protected by an indestructible natural breakwater.

Rotumah.

The Island of Rotumah, situated in 12° 30' S. lat., 177° 10' E. long., was discovered by the Pandora, in 1793, when searching for the mutineers of the Bounty. Lying to the north-west from two to four miles from the shore, are three small islets, Hattana, Hotuha and Waya. Of these only the last named is inhabited, and it contains but one small village. In 1879 the three principal Rotumah chiefs offered the islands to Great Britain, and they were annexed 13th May, 1881. The population was found at the census of 1901 to number 2,230, of whom two-thirds are Wesleyans, and the remainder Roman Catholics. The principal island is seven miles long by three miles broad, and contains about 9,000 acres. The staple export is copra, of which about 300 tons is shipped annually.

The distance of Rotumah from the seat of government, the infrequency of intercommunication, and the fact that the natives differ entirely from Fijians in language and in polity, necessitate a government on other lines than that of the colony generally. A European commissioner resides on the island, and is, under the governor, the chief executive and judicial authority in Rotumah. The commissioner's court, except in capital cases, takes the place of the supreme court of Fiji. There are two native stipendiary magistrates, who have jurisdiction in minor cases. The island is divided into seven districts, over each of which a chief, appointed by the governor, rules. The framing of local laws is entrusted to the Rotumah Regulation Board (consisting of the resident commissioner, the chiefs, and magistrates). Their enactments are subject to the approval of the legislative council of Fiji. The post of resident commissioner has now been amalgamated with that of provincial medical officer, and a hospital has been established on the island.
On these flats the soil is almost deep, easily worked, and especially that of provincial medical officer, and a hospital has been established on the island.
Population.

The aboriginal population of Fiji belongs to the darker of the two great Polynesian families, but, living on the confines of the fairer race, its blood has received considerable admixture. It was estimated in 1859 at 200,000; in 1868 at 170,000; and in 1871 at 140,000. By the epidemic of measles which occurred in 1875 it was reduced by more than one-fourth. The population of the colony, as ascertained at the census of 1881, 1891, and 1901 respectively, is shown in the following table:

| Class of Population | Estimated Population at 31st December, 1900 |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
|                     | Males | Females | Total |
| Europeans           |       |         |       |
| Half-Castes Indians |       |         |       |
| Polynesians         |       |         |       |
| Fijians             |       |         |       |
| Rotumans            |       |         |       |
| Others              |       |         |       |
| Total               |       |         |       |

The enumeration of the Fijian population in 1881 was somewhat incorrect, inasmuch as there was then a tendency on the part of the natives to exaggerate the strength and importance of their various divisions. By the time that the census of 1891 came to be made, that tendency had taken a turn in the opposite direction, under the impression that the assessment of taxes would follow the result of the enumeration. The birth and death returns furnished during the ten years, and believed to be fairly accurate, indicate a decrease of about 4,500 in the native Fijian population. The births among the native population in 1909 were 3,468, and the deaths 3,192. The birth rate was 39·68, and the death rate 36·53 per mil. The death rate among native children was formerly excessive, but it is satisfactory to note that among infants under one year, it has fallen from 72 per cent. in 1893 to 17·42 per cent. in 1909.

Indian immigration has largely replaced Polynesian immigration, hence the respective increase and decrease in the population of Indians and Polynesians.

It has been found that Indian labourers are both cheaper and more suitable than Polynesians for work on sugar plantations. The Indian immigrant population is now over 35,000.

The Wesleyan and Roman Catholic missions give the following as the number of their adherents at the end of the year 1909:

History.

The islands were discovered by Tasman in 1643, and visited by Captain Cook in 1769. Captain Bligh, on his memorable voyage in the launch of the Bounty, sighted part of the group in 1789, and was chased by a canoe from the island of Waya, in the Yasawa group. Missionaries settled in Fiji in 1835, and, after a time, met with great success.

In 1859 Thakombau, the most powerful chief of Fiji, offered the sovereignty of the islands to Great Britain. The offer was declined by the Duke of Newcastle in 1862. About that time the demand for cotton, owing to the American civil war, led to an influx of Europeans into Fiji for the purpose of cotton cultivation. In June, 1871, certain Englishmen set up a Fijian Government, with the principal chief, Thakombau, as king. A constitution was agreed upon, and a Parliament elected. The Parliament and the Government before long drifted into mutual hostility, and the Ministry latterly governed without the aid of the Parliament.

The question of annexing Fiji had been agitated both in Australia and England since 1869 on many grounds, and in August, 1873, the Earl of Kimberley commissioned Commodore Goodenough, commanding the squadron on the station, and Mr. E. L. Layard, Her Majesty's Consul in Fiji, to investigate and report on the matter. These Commissioners, on the 21st of March, 1874, reported an offer of the cession of the sovereignty of the islands from the chiefs, with the assent of the Europeans, but on certain terms which were not acceptable, and Sir Hercules Robinson, the Governor of New South Wales, was despatched to Fiji in September, 1874, to negotiate. This mission was completely successful, and the sovereignty of the islands was ceded to Her Majesty by
Thakombau, the Chief of Bau, Maafu, who was Chief of the so-called Lau Confederacy, which included not only the Lau Islands, but Tavuni and the greater part of Vanua Levu, and the other principal chiefs, in a deed of cession dated the 10th day of October, 1874. A charter was shortly afterwards issued by Her Majesty, erecting the islands into a separate colony, and providing for their government.

Climate.

The climate of Fiji is cool for the tropics, and the country is remarkably free from zymotic and endemic diseases. Dysentery is the only disease to which Europeans are peculiarly liable. Paludal fevers have never been met with.

The highest shade temperature at Suva in 1909 was 93°4' in February, and the lowest 63°3' in October. The total rainfall during the year was, at Suva, 112'309 inches. The greatest daily rainfall that has been recorded at Suva was 26'50 inches on 8th August, 1906, but this was exceptional. There is great variety of temperature and climate to be found in the group. The rainfall extends over the whole year, but April to October is usually the driest period. Between December and April hurricanes or heavy gales occasionally occur.

Constitution.

The constitution is regulated by Letters Patent of 21st March, 1904, as amended by Letters Patent of 30th August, 1905, and 27th July, 1907. The Executive Council consists of the Governor and five official members.

The Legislative Council consists of the Governor and ten official members, six elected members and two native members. To the natives a large share of self-government has been conceded. Their system of village and district councils has been recognised and improved, and supplemented by an occasional meeting of the high chiefs and representatives from each province, presided over by the Governor. There is a Native Regulation Board, constituted under "The Native Affairs Ordinance, 1876," consisting of the Governor (as president), the Chief Justice, the Attorney-General, the Native Commissioner, the Chief Medical Officer, J. K. M. Ross, nine Roko Tuis, and four other native members. The Board has power to make regulations with regard to the marriage and divorce of natives, succession to property, the jurisdiction and powers of native courts and magistrates in matters of civil and criminal procedure, and also in regard to other matters having reference to the good government and well-being of the native population. All such regulations have to receive the sanction of the Legislative Council before acquiring the force of law.

Levuka, in the island of Ovalau, with a population of 450 souls, was at first selected as the European capital, but during the year 1882 the seat of government was transferred to Suva, on the south coast of the island of Viti Levu, with a fine harbour. The white population of Suva and suburbs numbered 1,112 at the census of 1906. Both Suva and Levuka are ports of registry, and had, on 31st December, 1909, 14 vessels registered, of a total tonnage of 1,435 tons. During the year 1909 seagoing certificates were issued by the Marine Board to 213 vessels, of a total tonnage of 2,445; of these 62 were owned by Europeans (tonnage 1,217), 125 by natives (tonnage 838), 8 by Chinese (tonnage 129), 17 by half-castes (tonnage 238), and 1 by Indian (tonnage 3).

A portion of the revenue, varying from 14,000£. to 16,000£. net, is raised from taxation of the natives, as follows:

The Colony is divided into seventeen provinces, each under the control of a European Commissioner or a Roko Tui (chief native officer). Each province is sub-divided into districts, of which the head officers are termed Bulis. Once every year the provinces are severally assessed by the Legislative Council for a fixed amount of tax, which was till lately delivered entirely in the form of produce, but is now, at the discretion of the Governor, paid in many cases in money. The produce contributed consists of sugar-cane, copra, tobacco, yagona (Macropiper methysticum), maize, beche-de-mer, and occasionally green fruit and yams.

Sugar-cane is disposed of to the sugar mills under contracts which are generally entered into for a term of years. Copra (the principal item in which native taxes are paid) is sold by public tender annually, the contractor agreeing to give a fixed price per ton for all that is received.

Tobacco, maize, and other products are sold by tender or by public auction, as the quantity from time to time contributed and the state of the market will allow or renders expedient.

The Provincial Council, consisting of native officials and chiefs, presided over by an European Officer of the Government, distributes the provincial tax among the different districts, and there is then a further sub-division among the different villages by district councils, each presided over by its Bull. The amount and kind of produce paid by each province and district is recorded, and should the total value in any case exceed the amount of assessment the surplus is returned in the form of money. The amount thus returned in 1909 was 6,890£.

Certain provinces are now permitted to pay their tax in coin. The amount so paid in 1909 was 13,580£.

Local Government.

A municipality was established in 1877 in Levuka, and in 1882 one was established in Suva, on the transfer of the seat of government. These boards are at present regulated by the Municipal Institutions Ordinance, 1909. The governing body in each town is partly elected by the ratepayers and partly nominated by the Governor. Rates are collected on land and house property. General rates are limited to one shilling in the pound on the assessed value of rateable property; but special rates not exceeding two shillings in the pound are further provided for.

A grant-in-aid not exceeding one-fifth of the sum raised by general rate in the preceding year may be paid from general revenue to any town council, and in addition the revenue received from certain licences issued in respect of businesses carried on in a town may be paid to the council.

The revenue and expenditure in 1909 were:

| Revenue | Expenditure |
|---------|-------------|
| Suva town council | £3,215 | £3,575 |
| Levuka | £1,555 | £1,433 |
| Suva school council | £966 | £1,011 |
| Levuka | £741 | £714 |

Total | £6,477 | £6,733

Total receipts of local authorities, 6,477£. Total expenditure, 6,733£. In addition to the revenue and expenditure of the native local districts above referred to.
Education.

The Public Education Ordinance, 1890, provides for the election of separate school boards within the constituted districts (at present only Suva and Levuka are so constituted). The expenses of the boards are to be paid out of the "School Fund" of each district, consisting (1) Of an annual grant on the average attendance on a scale fixed by the Governor in Council; and (2) Of a contribution from the rating authorities of the amount required for school purposes beyond the Government grant.

Education is free to children within the school districts between six and fourteen years of age. A fee is charged to children not residing within the school district, or who are under or above the school age. The ordinary subjects of an English education are taught, and fees are charged for tuition in special subjects.

There are two common schools under these school boards, one in Suva, with 185 scholars, and one in Levuka, with 108 scholars on the roll.

There is also a Roman Catholic school for Europeans in Levuka (attendance 57), and two in Suva, with an attendance of 98.

The Wesleyan and Roman Catholic missions provide almost entirely for the education of the natives throughout the group. The former have 1,046 schools, with 914 native teachers, and 17,206 scholars.

The latter have 159 schools, with 1,767 scholars.

A Native High School has been established at Nasinu, near Suva, for the higher education of natives. It is maintained by public revenue. The number of scholars is 70.

A school on similar lines has been established in the Lau Province, to be maintained at the expense of the Province, with a subsidy of 300£ a year from General Revenue.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender currency, and the only coin in circulation, is British sterling.

The Bank of New South Wales has branches at Suva, Levuka, and Lantoka, and the Bank of New Zealand at the two former places.

Under Ordinance IV., of 1907, a Government Savings Bank was opened during 1908.

Industries.

The trade and commerce of the Colony depends for its existence on three staple industries, viz., (1) the cultivation, manufacture, and export of sugar; and (2) of copra (the dried kernel of the coconut); and (3) the growth and export of fruit, principally bananas and pineapples.

The principal exports at the date of the annexation of the Colony were copra, cotton (Sea Island), and maize, but the export of maize was soon displaced by that of sugar. Cotton continued to be the third export in point of value until the year 1882, after which it gradually subsided until the year 1888, when only 3½ tons were exported. In the meantime the fruit trade with the neighbouring Australasian colonies had arisen, after the establishment, through Government subsidy, of regular steam communication with Sydney, Auckland and Melbourne.

The export of fruit consists almost entirely of bananas and pineapples, but there is a small export of oranges, limes, lemons, citrons, grenadilles, and perhaps mangoes and guavas, which might well be extended.

The following table will illustrate the course of the trade in the three staple exports of the Colony:

| Year | Sugar | Fruit | Copra |
|------|-------|-------|-------|
|      | Quantity | Value | Quantity | Value |
| 1875 | 96 tons | £3,417 | 97 tons | £3,471 |
| 1890 | 15,291 tons | £244,655 | 57,658 tons | £4,657 |
| 1900 | 32,981 tons | £93,987 | 29,112 tons | £15,605 |
| 1902 | 35,905 tons | £37,601 | 25,226 tons | £10,683 |
| 1903 | 46,438 tons | £46,318 | 32,162 tons | £8,526 |
| 1904 | 52,138 tons | £469,391 | 22,102 tons | £7,408 |
| 1905 | 58,488 tons | £539,594 | 28,986 tons | £10,200 |
| 1906 | 38,623 tons | £347,198 | 97,678 tons | £9,772 |
| 1907 | 66,697 tons | £602,820 | 79,871 tons | £11,290 |
| 1908 | 66,149 tons | £647,306 | 62,217 tons | £12,931 |
| 1909 | 60,825 tons | £607,969 | 98,491 tons | £15,850 |

The other principal exports in 1909 consisted of—Bark, 1 ton, valued at 17£.; cocoanuts, 3,309 sacks, valued at 85£.; hides and pelts, 2,429 hides, valued at 1,333£.; molasses, 885,351 gallons, valued at 5,682£.; shell (tortoise), 16 cwts., valued at 2,331£.; and tea, 6,895 lbs., valued at 236£.

Minor exports consist of béche-de-mer, beans, peanuts, cow peas and skins.

The growth of rice has been commenced, and the cultivation of sugar cane is being considerably extended.

The planting of rubber and cocoa has been commenced, and promises to do well.

Cattle and sheep raising are exciting considerable attention, and many parts of the Colony seem admirably adapted to this pursuit.

About 80 per cent. of the trade of the Colony is with the Australian colonies and New Zealand, and the export of sugar to Canada is somewhat rapidly increasing. There is no direct communication with the United Kingdom, and all trade between Fiji and Great Britain consequently passes through the Australian colonies.

Means of Communication.

There is regular steam communication with the following places outside the Colony: Sydney (5 to 8 days), three or four times a month; Auckland (4 days), direct every four weeks, and via Samoa and Tonga every four weeks. Many extra steamers run during the sugar season. In addition to this, Suva is a port of call for the Canadian-Australian Royal Mail Line of Steamers which ply between Vancouver and Sydney via Honolulu, Suva, and Brisbane. A subsidised steam service with Melbourne has recently been established, and a direct steamer calling at Sydney on return voyage is now running.

Postage to the United Kingdom, India, the Australian States, and British Colonies* is 1d. per oz. To other countries in the Postal Union 2½d. per oz.

Internal postal rates: letters 1d. per oz.; newspapers not exceeding 4 ozs., ½d., exceeding 4 ozs., ld. A Parcels Post with the United Kingdom was established in June, 1890. The rate of postage is one shilling for the first 1 lb., and eightpence per lb. thereafter. There is also a parcels post with the Australian States, New Zealand, and Canada. The rate of postage is eightpence for the first 1 lb. and sixpence per lb. thereafter to the Australian States and New Zealand, and eightpence per lb. to Canada.

* See end of Introduction.
The Colony entered the Postal Union on 1st September, 1891.

The Imperial Postal Order system has been adopted by this Colony.

Letters from England sent via Sydney reach Fiji in about fifty days, letters via San Francisco, or Vancouver, in about 31 days.

There is a telephone from Suva to Lautoka, a distance of 125 miles, which is maintained by the Colonial Government, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and the Union Steamship Company jointly. There is a telegraph line between Suva and Levuka, a distance of 54 miles.

There is no railway in the Colony. Suva is now connected by Pacific Cable with Brisbane, via Norfolk Island, and with Canada, via Fanning Island. Intercommunication within the group is maintained by sailing boats and steam launches, and by two subsidised inter-island steamers. A few good roads have been constructed on the larger islands, and more are in process of construction under the supervision of Provincial Road Boards appointed by Government for the purpose.

THE GAMBIA.

Situation and Area.

The Gambia is a great river of Western Africa, falling into the Atlantic Ocean by a large estuary measuring in some parts nearly 27 miles across, but contracting to 10 miles between Bird Island and Cape St. Mary, and to little more than two between Barra Point and the town of Bathurst on St. Mary's Island. There are 26 feet of water over the bar of the river at low tide, and ocean-going steamers drawing no more than 13 feet can at present proceed without trouble to McCarthy's Island. Dredging operations are now being carried out at Kai Hai, a few miles below the Island, with the object of deepening the channel at that place. The town of Bathurst, 13° 24' N. lat., 15° 36' W. long., is situated on St. Mary's Island, a sandbank about three and a half miles long and a mile and a quarter broad, separated from the mainland by a narrow channel called Oyster Creek. It is an exceptionally clean town, and this fact was specially commented upon by the Commission sent out by the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. Bathurst is the seat of Government. A large portion of the island is a swamp, the level of which is in many parts below that of the river.

The Colony on the river Gambia consists of the Island of St. Mary, British Komnibo, Albreda, the Ceded Mile, and McCarthy's Island, situated between the Falls of Barraconda and Bathurst, and 158 miles distant from the latter. This island forms the line of demarcation between those portions of the river known as the Upper and Lower River. The total area of the Colony proper is about 69 square miles (equal to Jersey and Guernsey). The Protectorate extends on both banks of the river for 250 miles from its mouth. But by an ordinance No. 7 of 1902 all parts of the Colony, except the Island of St. Mary, were placed under the Protectorate system of administration. The Island of St. Mary has an area of about 2,500 acres, the greater part of which is swampy, and a population of 8,807. The territory administered as Protectorate is approximately 4,000 sq. miles, and has an estimated population of 152,000. A survey of the boundaries dividing the Gambia from Senegal was completed by the Anglo-French Boundary Commission in 1905.

History.

The Gambia was discovered by the early Portuguese navigators, but they made no settlement. In 1588 a patent was granted by Queen Elizabeth to some merchants in London and Exeter to trade with the Gambia. This Company did not prosper. Its voyages were not slave trading ventures but were made for legitimate commerce. In 1618 King James I. of England granted a charter to Sir Robert Rich and other London merchants. Their enterprise was entitled "The Company of Adventurers of London trading in Africa," and Fort James was built by them on a small island 17 miles from St. Mary's Island. Fort James was abandoned after the abolition of the slave trade, but it must always remain a prominent landmark in the history of West Africa.

About the year 1631 another British chartered company was formed, King Charles I. having granted a charter to Sir B. Young, Sir R. Digby and others. This venture was responsible for supplying British settlements in the West Indies with slaves for working estates. In fact the whole West African trade at this period was in slaves.

In 1662 King Charles II. granted a charter to a third company, known as the "Royal Adventurers of England trading in Africa." A few years later this company exhausted its capital and surrendered its charter. In 1672 a fourth company was incorporated under the name of the "Royal African Company," and it was not until 1783, after having in its early days reached the highest point of commercial prosperity which had been touched by England in Africa, that it was superseded by the "Company of Merchants." This company was formed with the consent of Parliament, after the right of trade had been abandoned to England by France under the treaty of Versailles, which guaranteed to the English their possession of Fort James and of the River Gambia, with the exception of a French factory subsequently established at Albreda on the north bank of the river. The same treaty gave the Senegal river to the French, with the exception of an exclusive right to trade with the Arabs at Portendic for gum, which was retained by England. The year 1807 saw the abolition of the slave trade, and though the "Company of Merchants" lingered on with an annual subsidy, their possessions were taken over by the Crown in 1821.

From 1807 the settlement was subject to the Government of Sierra Leone, and was annexed to it by Act of Parliament in 1821. In April, 1830, Mr. George Rendall was appointed the first Lieut.-Governor with powers which, prior to this, had been vested only in a Board of Merchants. Special endeavours were at once made to lay out the town of Bathurst, and to effect proper drainage on the island. In 1831 a Liberated African Department was formed, with headquarters at McCarthy's Island.

The Gambia, in the year 1843, was created an independent Colony, with a Governor and Executive and Legislative Councils for the administration of its affairs. Mr. H. P. Seagram was the first Governor of the Colony.

By the charter of 19th February, 1866, it became a portion of the Government of the West African Settlements, and continued to be so under the charter of the 19th December, 1874, until it was made a separate Government in 1888.

McCarthy's Island was purchased in 1823; the ceded mile was granted by the King of Barra in 1826 and 1832; St. Mary's Island was ceded in 1837; and British Komnibo was granted by the King of Komnibo in various sessions in 1840, 1850, and 1855.

An Infantry Militia Force was raised in 1862 for special service in Komnibo. Turbulent times had been experienced in the Gambia, due to tribal warfare between the Marabouts and Soninkkees, caused by religious differences. The term "Marabout" is given to the true followers of the Mohammedan faith; the Soninkkees being so called on account of their belonging to no faith and being addicted to drinking. Heavy fighting took place between these people in Baddibu on the north bank of the river, in the Komnibo territories, and throughout the country, and it was not until the year 1856 that an arrangement was arrived at to promote and maintain peace. The most renowned leader of the Marabouts was one Hamah Bah, commonly known as "Maba."
The Government from time to time had to take active measures against these people, and the European lives lost in punitive expeditions in the Gambia have been many.

A system at this date in the interior was the method of "custom," presents which had to be made to the Chiefs and Headmen before legitimate trade could be carried on by the merchants. This was as far as possible put a stop to by the Government, these "customs" being superseded by "stipends" such as still continue in operation.

In 1897 the countries of Fogni and Jarra, on the south bank of the river, came under British protection, and it became necessary for the Government to suppress the marauding Chief Fodi Kabba, who was causing trouble north of the Vintang Creek, some 26 miles from Bathurst, and proceeding eastwards worrying the people. An expedition was sent against Fodi Kabba and he was expelled, fleeing to French territory, where he formed a stronghold at Medina, his followers on British soil being completely routed.

In 1894 Chief Fodi Sillah, of Foreign Kommbo, became so aggressive in stopping and robbing traders that it was decided to send an expedition against him. At this time Brikama, Gunjur, Sukuta and Busumballa were the principal places in the occupation of Fodi Sillah and his people. The force, which comprised officers and men from the ships of war present, and from the West India Regiment, proceeded into Kommbo. Fodi Sillah was defeated and his strongholds destroyed. He fled to French territory, but was captured and deported to Saint Louis, where he died.

Foreign Kommbo was annexed by the British Government and is now divided into North, South and Central Kommbo.

The Protectorate system of administration has been established since 1894, and extended from time to time by agreement with the different chiefs concerned, until Ordinance No. 7 of 1902 was passed, providing fully for the Government of the whole Protectorate, which is divided into five Provinces and again into Districts. There is a Travelling Commissioner in each Province, and each District is under a Head Chief, with a native tribunal specially appointed by the Governor.

The Provinces are as follows:—North Bank Province, with the districts of Lower Niumi, Upper Niumi, Jokado, Lower Baddibu, Upper Baddibu, Sabach and Sanigall, 110 miles in length. McCarthy Province, with the districts of Lower Niani, Upper Niani, Lower Saloum, Eastern Saloum, Nianija, 85 miles in length. Upper River Province, with the districts of Sandu and Wuli on the North bank, and Kantora, Fulladu East, Gambisara and Fulladu West on the south bank of the river, 150 miles in length. South Bank Province, with the districts of Eastern Nianiana, Western Nianiana, Central Jarra, Eastern Jarra, Western Jarra, East Central Kiang and Eastern Kiang, 70 miles in length. Kommbo and Fogni Province, with the districts of Western Kiang, Fogni, Karenai, Fogni East, Kansalla and Bondalli, Fogni West, Vintang and Bruffutt, Kommbos East, Central, South, North, and Kommbo St. Mary, 85 miles in length.

In 1900 further trouble arose between the Marabouts and Sonninkees respectively, of the towns of Sankandi and Battelling, over the ownership of some rice fields. Two travelling Commissioners, Mr. Sitwell and Mr. Silva, with an escort of a sergeant of police and ten constables, proceeded to Sankandi with the object of settling the trouble; but unfortunately, owing to the treachery of the Headman, Dari Bana Dabu, both the Commissioners, the sergeant and five constables were foully murdered.

On the arrival of Sir George Denton in 1901, it was decided to send a punitive expedition against these people, and Colonel H. E. Brake was selected to command. After a short resistance the participators in the revolt were crushed and their town destroyed. Certain of the ringleaders of the disturbance fled and joined Fodi Kabba at Medina. Concerted action with the French Government of Senegal was taken however, and on the 23rd March, 1901, Medina was demolished and Fodi Kabba killed. Three other ringleaders were subsequently captured by the French, handed over to the British Government, tried and sentenced to death in the Supreme Court, and executed at Dumbuta, a large village near the scene of the murder of the two Commissioners.

Inhabitants of the Gambia.

The inhabitants are mostly of the negro race, the chief tribes being the Jollofs, Mandingos, Sarahoulis, Fullahs and Jolahs. The country of the Jollofs is on the North Bank or Senegal side of the river, and they form a large portion of the community in the town of Bathurst. As a race they are very proud, and claim for themselves a very ancient descent.

The Mandingos are the most numerous people on this portion of the African coast, and derive their name from Manding, a town some 700 miles inland and towards the boundary of the Colony of Sierra Leone. They are mostly Mohammedans.

The Jolahs come from Fogni, between the southern limit of Kommbo and on the north bank of the Cassamance River. Their country runs in a north easterly direction towards the south bank of the Gambia River as far as the mouth of the Vintang Creek. They are pagans and a wild uncivilised tribe.

The Sarahoulis are the most recent arrivals in the Gambia having migrated from the interior of Senegal. They are chiefly found in the eastern portion of the Upper River where they have established fairly large villages. They are all Mohammedans.

The Fullahs are the "Gipsies" of the Gambia, and are good farmers and herdsmen. Their features are mostly of the European type and their skins fairer than those of the average native of the Gambia. The capital of the Fullah country is Timbo in Futta Jallon, and is situated in north latitude 10° 38' and west longitude 11° 10'.

Industry.

There are no mines in the Colony, but in several places in the Protectorate iron ore is to be found in large quantities. Investigations properly undertaken might disclose other mineral wealth.

A small quantity of cotton is grown but only for local consumption, and it is made into native cloths, known as Pagns. The weaving is very primitive, native looms of an ingenious kind being used and the cloth woven in long strips. In quality this cloth compares favourably with imported Manchester cotton cloths. The strips of native cloth average about 27 yards in length and are about 9 inches in width.

There is a good deal of boat building and repairing carried out. Most of the cutters used in the ground nut trade have been built in the Colony, and there are a number of expert shipwrights in Bathurst.
Pottery is made in the Upper River Province. A considerable amount of excellent leather is produced from goat skins. It is however not exported but utilised by the people in making bags, slippers, sandals, scabbards, saddles and horse trappings, and the skilful manner in which coloured grasses, silk cotton, etc., are laced through the decorative portion of the leather work is most ingenious. Each town or village usually has a "Koranki" man, or leather worker.

There is an abundance of fish in the lower reaches of the Gambia River, and large quantities are dried and taken each season into the Protectorate for sale. Nearly all the fish brought into Bathurst are caught in nets. Quantities of oysters are obtained in the creek, and are cooked by the people for food, the shells being made into native lime.

The ground nut is the staple article of cultivation, the people devoting their whole attention to this product, growing, in comparison, but small quantities of rice and corn for their own consumption.

The population, however, of this country is not large enough to cope with the cultivation of other products for export. Ground nuts pay the producer on an average £4 to £6 per acre, and, beyond the sowing of the seed and an occasional hoeing, give the farmer very little trouble, and he knows that there will be no difficulty in disposing of his crop, and therefore prefers cultivating this to any other economic product known to him.

There is in Bathurst a fair supply of vegetables such as garden eggs, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, ochras, cassada, peppers, native spinachs, etc., and as most of the Europeans have a garden it is possible to procure lettuces, cabbages, carrots, turnips and beans from December to May.

Pawpaws, limes, oranges, bananas and mangoes are obtainable.

Maize, corn, palm kernels, india-rubber and wax are also produced in the Protectorate, and a great number of medicinal roots and herbs are to be found, samples of which can be seen at the Imperial Institute. There is very little timber in the country suitable for exportation.

A considerable entrepot trade is done with the French settlements and the adjoining coast districts in cotton goods, spirits, tobacco, rice, and hardware.

Large quantities of kola nuts are imported from Sierra Leone.

Most of the exports, principally ground nuts, go to France, but 49% of the import trade comes from England. Bathurst is a port of registry, and had, on 31st December, 1908, registered 99 vessels of 1,788 tons in the aggregate.

Relations with the Interior.

Since the delimitation of the boundary of the Protectorate by the Anglo-French Commissioners in 1891, steps have been taken to bring the inhabitants of the Protectorate gradually into closer relationship with the Government of the Colony. An Order in Council, issued on the 23rd of November, 1893, provided for the establishment of Her Majesty's jurisdiction within the Protectorate, and since then an Ordinance has been passed providing for the establishment of magistrates and also native courts.

Travelling Commissioners regularly, during the eight months of dry weather, travel through the Protectorate on both banks of the river for 200 miles, and in Komnbo and Fogni. These parts of the Protectorate are gradually coming more under the immediate control of the Government. A "yard" or "hut" tax, which averages about 4s. per annum for a family, is imposed in the Protectorate.

Stipends are now only paid in a few cases, and presents are occasionally made to the more influential chiefs, in return for their services in preserving peace and keeping the trade routes open.

Currency and Banking.

The legal tender and usual currency is British sterling, but a great number of French 5 franc pieces are in circulation, the estimated value of which is 150,000l., and these are received at an exchange value of 3s. 10½d. For trade purposes, however, they realise 4s. each. Bank of England notes are not legal tender but are accepted by the Bank of British West Africa—the only Bank in Bathurst. The circulation, however, is very small, amounting probably to only some 250l. There is also a little French gold in the Colony.

The average rate of exchange for bills drawn on London during the year was one per cent.

A Government savings bank was established in 1886, and had on 31st Dec., 1909, 4,508l., deposited by 673 persons.

General Land Values.

The value of land in the important parts of Bathurst has greatly increased of late years, and it is impossible to accurately estimate the value of it in the main thoroughfare. In the adjoining streets for land, up to datum as fixed by the Colonial Engineer, 200l. per acre would probably be a fair price.

In the back streets, plots of about a quarter of an acre fetch 12l., and in the outlying portion of the town, without any filling up, they are worth from 4l. to 8l.

The Government rights in open spaces which hitherto were disposed of at a valuation fixed by the Colonial Engineer, are now sold by Public Auction.

Land in the Protectorate can be obtained from the Chief of a district for purposes of farming with the sanction of the Governor, but sites for trading factories are granted by the Government at an annual rental of 1s. per 100 square yards, with a minimum payment of 3/ per annum.

Education.

The schools, which are wholly in the hands of the several denominations, receive grants-in-aid. Of ordinary elementary schools in Bathurst, there is one Anglican, two Wesleyan and two Roman Catholic, with 1,344 scholars in all. Education is not compulsory, and fees are charged. In addition, the Wesleyan Society have established a Technical School, with 17 pupils, on undenominational lines, to which the Government contribute 300l. a year; and there is also a Mohammedan School with 117 pupils, at which the ordinary rudiments of an English and Arabic education are taught, the teachers being paid by the Government. At McCarthy’s Island there is one elementary Wesleyan school with 49 pupils, and another at Komnbo with 39 pupils.

Means of Communication.

Communication between the Colony and Europe is effected by the steamers of the African Steamship Co. (Messrs. Elder Dempster & Co.), which run fortnightly between Liverpool and Bathurst, and those of the Woerman Line from Hamburg, which communicate with the Colony once each month; these latter steamers however do not call on the homeward passage, but proceed direct to Europe from Sierra Leone. Steamers of the Messagerie Maritime sail to and from Bordeaux and Dakar fortnightly, and Dakar being only 90 miles from Bathurst, passengers often join these steamers there, and get to Europe in eight days. There are also the steamers of the Company Belge Maritime de Congo which run between Antwerp and Matadi, calling at Dakar once every three weeks and taking and landing passengers at Southampton.

The cost of the passage by this latter line and the vessels of Messrs. Elder Dempster & Co., is 22l. first class, and 15l. 13s. td. second. The cost of a passage by the Messagerie Maritime Line varies from 22l. to 25l. according to cabin.

Internal communication is comparatively easy for West Africa, most of the important firms having steamers or launches which make frequent trips during the trading season up the river; these vessels are ready to accept any passengers or freight which may offer. The cost of a passage to McCarthy’s Island, 158 miles from Bathurst, is 1l. 5s. first class, and 12s. deck.

The Government Yacht “Mansah Kilah,” also runs when required, and on ordinary trips takes passengers and freight at the same rates as the other vessels.

Telegraph cables place Bathurst in communication with Europe and West Africa. There are no railways, internal telegraphs, or metalled roads, save one from Bathurst to Cape St. Mary, 7½ miles across the Oyster Creek Bridge, which connects the island of St. Mary with the mainland of British Komnbo. Horses will live, and the river forms an unrivalled highway for 300 miles. The roads in the Protectorate are kept clear, and light traps or bicycles could pass along in those districts which are free from swamps.

The rules of the Postal Union have been adopted by the Colony and its Protectorate.

The following are the rates of postage:

For each letter posted in the Colony for delivery therein or the Protectorate, 1d. per 2 oz. in weight.

For each letter addressed to any place in the United Kingdom, British Colonies, or Foreign Countries which have accepted the penny postage, 1d. per oz. or fraction thereof.

To other foreign countries 2½d. per oz. or part thereof.

Parcels Post. If posted at places within the Colony and Protectorate for delivery therein.

For every pound or fraction thereof, 3d.

If addressed to the United Kingdom or British Colonies in West Africa:

Not over 3 lbs. in weight, 1s.
Over 3 lbs., but not over 7 lbs., 2s.
Over 7 lbs., but not over 11 lbs., 3s.

There is no direct parcel post scheme at present with foreign countries. All parcels are forwarded through the medium of the General Post Office, London, a small additional charge being made for onward transmission.

The Revenue for the Post Office is derived from the sale of stamps, commission on Money and Postal Orders and the rent from private boxes, &c.

Climate.

The climate of the Gambia during the dry season from the end of November to the middle of May is pleasant and fairly healthy. But during the wet season—June to October—the conditions are much the same as elsewhere on the West Coast of Africa, though the change from excessive dryness to the damp atmosphere so prevalent in the Gulf of Guinea probably makes them more felt. In the interior from March to June it is intensely hot.

The lowest reading of the thermometer in the shade during 1909 was at Bathurst 47 degrees in January, the highest recorded temperature being 105 in March, but at McCarthy’s Island the shade maximum was 112 in April and May.

The rainfall during the year was 56½ inches. The rainfall varies considerably; the average may, however, be taken to be 50 inches.
