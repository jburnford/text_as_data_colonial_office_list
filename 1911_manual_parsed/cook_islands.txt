COOK ISLANDS.

The Cook Islands were declared to be under British protection in October, 1888, by Captain Bourke, of H.M.S. "Hyacinth," and the Hervey Islands, Manuae, Te Au-o-Tu and Takutea by Commander Nicolls, of H.M.S. "Cormorant," in June, 1889.

Until 1901 British authority was represented by a Resident who was paid by the Government of New Zealand, and reported direct to the Governor of that Dominion. The first British Resident, Mr. F. J. Moss, who was appointed in 1890, succeeded in 1891 in arranging for the establishment of an Elective Federal Parliament to make laws for the whole group. Each island, however, continued to enjoy self-government in such purely local affairs as it could properly manage for itself. The Federal Executive Council or Government was composed of the Arikiis, or Kings and Queens, who are also the principal landowners. The chief of these, Queen Makea, Ariki of Avarua, was the nominal head of the Government. A Supreme Court was established, and a law was passed regulating the sale of intoxicants, and imposing a general ad valorem duty of 10 per cent. on imports. All laws and administrative acts were subject to the approval of the Resident, who was also a Deputy and Judicial Commissioner for the Western Pacific, and Chief Justice of the High Court of the Cook Islands.

The Islands became part of the Dominion of New Zealand from the 11th June, 1901. The administration and laws were continued in force subject to the provisions of the Cook Islands Government Act, passed in that year.

Resident Commissioner at Rarotonga, Captain J. Eman Smith, N.Z.M.

RAROTONGA.

Distant from Auckland, 1,638 miles; circumference, 20 miles; height, 2,100 ft.; area, 26 square miles; population, 2,441.

Rarotonga is the most fertile and valuable of the Cook group, and it has the largest population. The island has been exceptionally favoured by nature, not only with delightful scenic attractions, but also with a remarkably rich and productive soil.

The aborigines are very closely akin to the Maoris of New Zealand.

The seat and centre of the government of the Cook Islands—the double township of Avarua and Avatiu—is situated on the north or lee side of the island of Rarotonga, opposite two small openings in the coral reef. The former has the advantage of a boat harbour, where small craft can be moored in safety when the wind is not blowing in from the sea. The residence of the Commissioner and the establishment of the ex-queen are situated here.

The dwellings of the natives are built of coral concrete, as are also the Government offices.

Goods received from the Cook and other annexed islands are now treated as New Zealand produce, and not as imports. The total value of exports from the Cook islands for 1909 was £73,652l., of which £55,977l. represented trade with New Zealand. The principal items were: fresh fruit, £37,339l.; copra, £25,946l.; pearl-shell, £900l.; coffee, £493l.

*A full account of these Dependencies will be found in the "New Zealand Official Year Book," to which the Editors desire to express their acknowledgements.
Revenue and expenditure of the Cook and Northern Islands for the year 1909-10: Revenue, 7,653£; expenditure, 8,230£.

Mangaia.

Distant from Rarotonga, 116 miles; circumference, 30 miles; height, 656 ft.; area, 30 square miles; population, 1,531.

Physical Features.

Mangaia is the most southerly island of the Cook group, and is second in importance to Rarotonga chiefly on account of its difficult and dangerous coast.

Coconuts, bananas, oranges, limes, citrons and other fruits grow plentifully.

Resident Agent, J. C. Cameron.

Atiu.

Distant from Rarotonga, 116 miles; circumference, 20 miles; height, 374 ft.; area, 22 square miles; population, 918.

Resident Agent, J. T. Large.

The Island.

Atiu resembles Mangaia in formation, being a raised mass of coral with high jagged cliffs facing the sea.

On the highest point of the central ridge coconuts, bananas, oranges, and coffee grow with the utmost luxuriance; and the kumera, most valuable and uncertain of South Sea vegetables, yields large crops. The coconut-palm grows well everywhere, but especially so on the coral rock formation.

Mauke.

Distant from Rarotonga, 150 miles; circumference, 10 miles; height, about 60 ft.; area, 5½ square miles; population, 446.

Mauke is a low circular island about two miles across, lying to the north-east of Rarotonga. Like Mangaia and Atiu, it is surrounded by an unbroken fringing reef. It is marvellously fertile, and in value and quantity the produce exported is greater than that of Atiu.

Resident Agent, Tamuera Tangata.

Mitiaro.

Distant from Rarotonga, 140 miles; circumference, 5 miles; height, about 50 ft.; area, 6 square miles; population, 210.

This island is a good instance of an elevated coral reef, thinly coated with sand and gravel of the same material. The surface is not more than six feet above high-water mark.

Takutka.

Distant from Rarotonga, 125 miles; area, ½ square mile.

This island was presented to the Crown by the Ariki of Atiu to whom it belonged. It is a coral island, moderately fertile, and will be utilised as a Government plantation.

Aitutaki.

Distance from Rarotonga, 140 miles; circumference, 14½ miles; height, 450 ft.; area, 7 square miles; population, 1,244, including 82 natives absent.

The name includes the island anciently known as "Arahura," and some seven or eight smaller islands on the vast barrier reef. Some of these are volcanic, and would seem to have been small peaks on the lip of an extinct volcano, now submerged.

The island itself is pear-shaped, about four miles by two; its highest part being 450 feet high.

Copra is the chief production, and some of the best oranges and pineapples on the market are grown here.

The Aitutakians are naturally a hardy race, and industrious when away from their own homes. They are said to be the best sailors in the Cook group, and their services are much in demand for working the cargo on vessels at Tahiti. They make fans and mats, and are expert at plaiting various fibres for hatmaking.

Resident Agent,

Manuae and Te Au-o-Tu.

Distant from Rarotonga, 120 miles; area of Manuae, 2½ square miles; population 10.

These two small islands are better known as the Hervey Group. They are situated about midway between Atiu and Aitutaki, and are owned by the people of the latter place.

The islands have been leased to the Cook Island Trading Company.

Niue.

Distant from Rarotonga, 580 miles; circumference, 40 miles; height, 200 ft.; area, 100 square miles; population, 4,402, including 580 natives absent.

Niue, or Savage Island, was placed under a separate administration by an Amending Act of 1903. It is a long, low island, fringed with a misty cloud of fine spray. The shores being too deep and steep to support a barrier reef, the coastline is deprived of its protection. It is fertile, but fresh water is very scarce.

Much of the land is encumbered with a dense scrub of guava bush.

The orange, the coconut, and other tropical products grow well, and the lemon flourishes on the rocky shores.

The natives of Niue are somewhat different in character from other Polynesians. They are very industrious, and the men are often engaged at Tonga and elsewhere as labourers. The girls and women plait hats, which are exported to New Zealand and Australia. They are keen traders, but are much averse to strangers obtaining a foothold in the island itself.

The exports for 1909-10 amounted to 12,203£., and the imports to 10,047£. The revenue for 1909-10 was 1,683£., and the expenditure 1,260£. The principal exports were copra, 7,858£., and hats, 3,247£.

Resident Commissioner, H. Cornwall.

Palmerston Atoll.

Distant from Rarotonga, 273 miles; area, 1 square mile; population, 82.

The Palmerstons are situated upon an irregular ring of coral reef, measuring outside about four miles and a half by two miles and a half, just awash with the tide. The narrow ring is about half a mile in width, and it supports eight little islets, nearly all covered with cocoanut palms. The largest of these is little more than half a mile in length and about a quarter of a mile wide.

Copra is the only article of export.

Resident Agent, J. Masters.
PENRHYN.

Distant 735 miles from Rarotonga; area, 3 square miles; population 420.

This atoll is known to the Polynesians as Togareva or Ma-ngaro-ngaro and is valuable only by reason of the existence of pearlshell beds in the extensive lagoon. The lagoon has now been proclaimed a reserve for public pearlshell fishing, and regulations controlling pearlshell diving have been made.

The cocoanut crop is considerable. Fresh water is very scarce.

Resident Agent, E. F. Hawk.

SUWARROW.

Distant from Rarotonga, 530 miles; area, ½ square mile; population 30.

Suwarrow is an atoll with a splendid lagoon, which produces a very good class of pearlshell.

MANIHIKI AND RAKAHANGA.

Distant from Rarotonga, 650 and 670 miles respectively; area, each 2 square miles; population, Manihiki, 543, including 22 natives absent; Rakahanga, 402, including 50 natives absent.

Manihiki, or Humphrey, is nearly circular. Béche-de-mer is obtained from the lagoon. The island occasionally suffers from drought.

Rakahanga, or Rierson, is also an atoll.

The former has until lately produced a limited amount of pearlshell, but about the end of 1900 it was found that the beds were exhausted by over-fishing. The Manihiki lagoon has now been proclaimed a reserve for public pearlshell fishing, and regulations controlling diving made as in the case at Penrhyn.

The only industry is now that of copra-making.

Resident Agent, H. Williams.

PUKAPUKA, OR DANGER ISLAND.

Pukapuka is a small solitary atoll about three miles in diameter, which produces pearlshell. It is about 700 miles from Rarotonga, and has an area of two square miles. The population is 467 persons, including 32 natives absent.

Education.

The education of the children living in the Cook and other islands is in the hands of the London Missionary Society, which provides some 2,500 children with a sound and useful education. At Tereora, in Rarotonga, the Mission supplies an English education for the children of those leading men that are willing to pay a small fee per annum. At the present time there are 50 children at Tereora under a qualified teacher, and in aid of this establishment a subsidy of 4l. per head is paid by the Islands Government.

To the above must be added the good work done by the Sisters of St. Joseph, who have established themselves in Rarotonga, and have some 80 pupils.

Trade.

Oranges and bananas have heretofore been the chief exports, and the latter are being extensively planted. The fruit trade is developing satisfactorily, but it is on the export of copra that dependence must chiefly be placed.
