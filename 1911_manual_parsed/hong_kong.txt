HONG KONG.

Situation and Area.

Hong Kong is one of a number of Islands situated off the south-eastern coast of China, at the mouth of the Canton River, and lies about 40 miles east of Macao, 91 miles south of Canton, between 22° 9' and 22° 17' N. lat., and 114° 5' and 114° 18' E. long. The island is an irregular ridge, stretching nearly east and west; its broken and abrupt peaks rising to the height of nearly 2,000 feet above the sea level. Its length is about 11 miles, its breadth from 2 to 5 miles, its area rather more than 29 square miles (a third larger than Guernsey). It is separated from the mainland of China by a narrow strait, known as the Lyseun Pass, which does not exceed half a mile in width. The opposite peninsula of Kowloon (2½ square miles) was ceded to Great Britain by a Treaty entered into by Lord Elgin in 1861 with the Government of China, and now forms part of the Colony; which also includes Stonecutter's, Green, Aplechow, Middle, Round, and other islets.

In 1898 an agreement was concluded with the Chinese Government for the extension of Hong Kong territory by an area adjacent to British Kowloon, in the province of Kwong-tung, including Mira Bay and Deep Bay, this area to be leased for 99 years; a stipulation was included that within the walled city of Kowloon (which lies outside of British Kowloon) the Chinese officials then stationed there should continue to exercise jurisdiction except so far as might be inconsistent with the military requirements for the defence of Hong Kong, but that within the remainder of the newly-leased territory Great Britain should have sole jurisdiction. In 1899 the Chinese officials ceased to exercise jurisdiction within Kowloon City, which thereafter, by Her late Majesty's Order in Council, was incorporated in the leased territory and became subject to British rule. The area of the mainland leased is about 370 square miles, and a careful survey of the territory was completed in 1904. This new territory has its headquarters at Tai Po on an arm of Mira Bay. A District Officer, who performs police and magisterial duties, and an Assistant District Officer, reside there.

General Description.

The waterways of the Colony form one of the most magnificent harbours in the world, having an area of ten square miles. The granite hills which surround it rise between 2,000 and 3,000 feet high, the whole offering a coup d'œil which blends the wild scenery of Scotland with the classic beauty of Italy. The city of Victoria extends for four miles at the base of the hills which protect the south side of the harbour, and contains, with its suburbs, 336,488 inhabitants. Being built on the slope of the hills facing the sea, the general aspect of the town is perhaps more striking and picturesque from the water than that of any other city in the east, whilst many of the streets are shaded with well-grown and handsome trees. On the new Praya West Reclamation, completed in 1903, some new and handsome buildings stand, and others are in course of erection.

The rainfall for 1909 was 75.72 inches as compared with 91.87 in 1908, and 93.54 in 1907. The average 1900—1909 was 81.10. The range of the thermometer in 1909 was from 87.5° in August to 57.0° in February. The rainy season extends from May to October; the wettest month in 1909 was October, with 23.98 inches. Typhoons are prevalent during the months July to October. On October 19th, 1909, a typhoon occurred, but there was little damage or loss of life.

History.

The Colony, then a desolate island, sparsely inhabited by fishermen, was ceded to Great Britain in January, 1841; the cession was confirmed by the Treaty of Nankin, in August, 1842; and the charter bears date 5th April, 1843. The additions subsequently obtained on the mainland have been noted above.

Hong Kong did not become of much commercial importance until the discovery of gold in Australia, in 1851, and the consequent Chinese emigration. Its trade has gradually increased with the opening up of China to foreign trade. Large local banking, dock, steamboat, and insurance companies were established between 1865 and 1872, and the trade was greatly increased by the opening of the Suez Canal.

The city is the depot for an incessant flow of Chinese emigration and immigration, the number in 1909 being 222,251 (principally to and from the Straits); emigrants, 77,420; immigrants, 144,821, excluding to and from China ports. The increase in emigration as compared with last year may be accounted for by return of the business to normal conditions, and to the resumption of emigration to Banka and Billiton.

Industry.

The island produces little or nothing, but its position has made it a centre of trade in many kinds of goods. Amongst the principal are opium, sugar, flour, salt, earthenware, oil, amber, cotton, and cotton goods, sandal-wood, ivory, betel, vegetables, live stock, granite, &c., &c. The transactions of the tea and silk trade are largely controlled by Hong Kong firms. There are a few manufactories, which are rapidly increasing in number and importance, producing rope, sugar, rum, beer, paper, vermilion, sauce, bricks, tiles and cement, bamboo work, and stores of every description for the supply of shipping. There is a considerable boat-building industry among the Chinese.

Shipping.

Hong Kong being a free port†, it is not possible to give a correct return of imports and exports, but the enormous extent of the trade with which it is connected may be approximately estimated from the amount of shipping which has steadily grown, with one or two slight fluctuations, for over twenty years.

The total tonnage entering and clearing during the year 1909 amounted to 34,830,845 tons, being an increase, compared with 1908, of 215,064 tons.

There were 263,687 arrivals of 17,379,143 tons, and 263,593 departures of 17,451,702 tons.

Of British ocean-going tonnage 3,872,254 tons entered, and 3,863,673 tons cleared.

Of British river steamers 1,849,830 tons entered, and 1,851,924 tons cleared.

Of foreign ocean-going tonnage 3,924,122 tons entered, and 3,933,786 tons cleared.

Of foreign river steamers 369,147 tons entered, and 366,535 tons cleared.

Of steamships under 60 tons trading to ports outside the colony, 70,242 tons entered, and 70,242 tons cleared.

Of junks in foreign trade 1,099,106 tons entered, and 1,144,864 tons cleared.

Hong Kong is well provided with dock accommodation. The Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock Company, who were aided by two loans from the British Government in 1864 and 1885, under the Colonial Docks Act, have three dry docks and two slips at their Kowloon establishment, one dry dock at Mong Kok Tsui, on the western side of the Kowloon Peninsula, and two at Aberdeen, on the south side of the island of Hong Kong. The Admiralty have built a large dock in the Naval establishment in the middle of the City of Victoria, and Messrs. Butterfield & Swire a still larger one at Quarry Bay, just inside the Lyeeun Pass. The two last will accommodate any ship afloat.

Besides these there are several building slips and repairing shops owned by Europeans and Chinese in various parts of the Colony.

Currency and Banking.

The currency of Hong Kong consists of the following coins (vide Order in Council, 2nd Feb., 1895):

1. The silver dollar of Mexico.
2. British dollar.
3. The Hong Kong dollar, half-dollar, and 20-cent, 10-cent, and 5-cent pieces, issued from the Hong Kong Mint (1866-68).
4. Half-dollars, 20-, 10-, and 5-cent pieces, imported from England, and coined at the Royal Mint and Birmingham Mint.
5. Copper coins representing one-hundredth part of the dollar (called one cent), and one-thousandth part of the dollar (mil or cash), imported from England.

There were issued from the Hong Kong Mint 2,108,054 dollars and 58,587 half-dollars; and 20-, 10-, and 5-cent pieces to the nominal value of $402,671. There have been obtained from England, and put into circulation up to 31st Dec., 1908, subsidiary coins (which now include half-dollars) to the nominal value of $43,999,830.

The coins issued from the Hong Kong Mint are never met with in the Colony now, and of the coins imported from England it is estimated that not more than 10 per cent. remain in the Colony.

A scheme was approved in 1903 for the payment of the higher and non-clerical officers in sterling, to be converted into dollars locally, according to a monthly average rate of exchange. Existing higher officers had the option of adopting the new scale, while those who preferred to retain their dollar salaries continue to draw exchange compensation—i.e., an allowance in dollars sufficient to make up the difference between the exchange value of the dollar and a dollar equal to 3s., with certain privileged rates for drawing leave salary and pension at home. The maximum exchange value of the dollar for the payment of these salaries was in 1907 fixed at 2s.

There are six principal banks, Chartered Bank of India, Australia, and China, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, National Bank of China, Limited, Mercantile Bank of India, Limited, International Banking Corporation, and the Yokohama Specie Bank, of which the first three had a note circulation of $20,585,326 on 31st December, 1908. There is no savings bank under Government control, but one conducted by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation. The Comptoir National d'Escompte de Paris has an agency in the Colony.

Local weights and measures are the following:
1 tael = 1½ oz.; 1 picul = 133½ lbs. (avoirdupois);
7½ catties = 1 imperial gallon; 1,000 Chinese cash = 1 dollar.

Means of Communication.

Hong Kong is extremely well situated as regards telegraphic communication, in all directions, with all parts of the world. The Eastern Extension Telegraph Company (British) by means of two cables to Singapore, via Labuan and Cape St. James respectively, provide good connections with Europe, via India, with Australasia and with the other British Colonies and possessions. By their cable to Manilla connection is made with the direct American cable, thence to San Francisco. Two cables to Shanghai, belonging respectively to the Eastern Extension and to the Great Northern (Danish) Companies, via Foochow and Amoy respectively, give a good connection with Shanghai (North China), Japan and Russia; and the system of the Great Northern Telegraph Company gives a good service to Europe, via Asiatic Russia.

Hong Kong possesses unrivalled steam communication. The P. & O. S. N. Co. and the M. M. Co. convey the European mail weekly, the Norddeutscher Lloyd Co. maintain a regular fortnightly mail service between Bremen and Hong Kong, the P. M. S. S. Co., O. & O. S. S. Co. and the Toyo Kisen Kaisha maintain a mail service with San Francisco, the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. a regular mail service with Vancouver, B.C., a regular line has been established by the Northern Pacific S. S. Co. to Tacoma, and Portland, Oregon, and the Portland and Asiatic S. N. Co. also run a line of steamers to Portland, the Great Northern Steamship Co. maintain a monthly service to Seattle with ships of over 20,000 tons gross register, the Eastern and Australian S. S. Co., the China Navigation Co. and the Norddeutscher Lloyd keep up a frequent but rather irregular service with the Australian Colonies, and Nippon Yusen Kaisha maintains service to Europe, India, Australia, and the United States (Seattle). In addition to these several great lines of merchant steamers run between ports in Great Britain and Hong Kong, of which the China Mutual S. S. Co., Ocean S. S. Co., and the Glen, Warrack, Mogul, Ben Union, and Shell lines are the most conspicuous. The Austrian Lloyd's steamers also ply from Trieste to Hong Kong, those of the Hamburg-Amerika line from Hamburg, and the Navigazione Generale Italiana Company's steamers run monthly from Genoa. Regular steam communication between Java and Hong Kong has been established by the Indo-China S. N. Co.'s and the Java-China-Japan Line. Between the ports on the east coast of China, Formosa and Hong Kong the steamers of the Douglas S. S. Co. ply regularly twice a week, and those of the Osaka Shosen Kaisha weekly, and there is constant steam communication with Hoihow, Manila, Saigon, Haiphong, Tourane, Bangkok, Borneo, etc. With Shanghai, Tientsin, and the ports of Japan there is frequent communication by steamers of the Indo-China S. N. Co., China Navigation, and other lines, in addition to the English, French and German mail steamers, which leave weekly. With Calcutta there are services by the Indo-China S. N. Co. and the Apar Line, about once a fortnight by each

Between Hong Kong, Macao, and Canton there is a daily steam service, and tri-weekly steamers as far as Wuchow on the West River.

A cable tramway connects the city with the higher levels, and another is contemplated. An electric tramway on the overhead trolley system from Shaukiwan to Kennedy Town, along the whole extent of the city, was completed and opened in July, 1904. No internal telegraph communication exists except for police and military purposes.* The island possesses few roads available for vehicular traffic except in the town of Victoria. A road has been constructed to complete the circuit of the island. The usual means of conveyance outside Victoria is by boat, chair, and 'ricksha'. There are good roads in Kowloon, and a road from Kowloon ferry now runs to Tai Po Hú on an arm of Mirs Bay. The construction of a railway from Kowloon to the Chinese frontier, where it is to join a line from Canton, was completed and the line opened to traffic in October, 1910. It is anticipated that through communication to Canton will be established over the Chinese section by June, 1911. The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters | Each additional oz. |
|---------|-------------------|
| United Kingdom, India, Egypt, the Colonies and Protectorates which have adopted the Imperial Penny Postage, and the British Agencies in China | 4 cents |
| Europe and America | 6 ,, |
| Hong Kong, Canton, and Macao | 2 ,, |

Direct Money Orders are exchanged with the United Kingdom, Germany and German Colonies in the South Seas, Canada, United States of America, Cape Colony, Transvaal, India, Ceylon, the Australian Commonwealth, the Dominion of New Zealand, Straits Settlements, Federated Malay States, British North Borneo, Sarawak, Siam, Macao, Japan, and Kiaoutschou. British Postal Orders are now payable in Hong Kong and at the British agencies.

Education.

The number of Government schools and schools which receive grants from Government is 70, of which 23 are English Schools, i.e., schools in which the English language is the medium of instruction, and 47 are Vernacular Schools. This number includes two schools which are reserved for children of European-British parentage.

The total number of pupils in average attendance at Government and Grant Schools was 6,560 in 1909. Of these, 2,326 were in Government, and 4,234 in Grant Schools; 4,014 pupils received instruction in English, and 2,546 in the Vernacular. The proportion of boys to girls was 4,218 to 2,342.

A Technical Institute supplies instruction in commercial and technical subjects. The total enrolment in 1909 was 256.

*There are telegraph lines connected with the Gap Rock, Waglan, Green Island, and Cape Collinson Lighthouses, in connection with the signalling of ships, &c.
The foundation stone of the Hongkong University was laid in spring of 1910, and it will probably be opened early in 1912. The work of the English Schools aims at preparing pupils eventually for the University. Meanwhile, the work in the three highest classes is arranged so as to prepare pupils for the Oxford Local Examinations.

Revenue.

About one-fifth of the revenue is derived from the Opium Monopoly and one-fifth from municipal rates for police, lighting, water and other purposes: 13 per cent. on the annual value in Victoria, the Hill District and Kowloon; and rates varying from 7 to 12½ per cent. in the outlying villages, payable by the owners. The annual rates payable on the valuation for 1909-10 are $1,378,956 '04, a decrease of $2,472,76 on the previous valuation. The remainder is derived from licences, land revenue, stamps, duties, and fees. The duties on intoxicating liquors, instituted in September, 1909, are expected to realize $600,000 in 1910, Land Sales to reach $100,000, Stamp Revenue to reach $700,000, and Postal Revenue $472,000. The total Revenue for 1910 is estimated at $6,908,797.

Constitution.

The Government is administered under Letters Patent of 19th January, 1888, by a Governor, aided by an Executive Council, composed of six official and two unofficial members, besides the Governor. The Legislative Council is presided over by the Governor, and is composed of seven official and six unofficial members, three of whom are nominated by the Crown on the recommendation of the Governor (two being usually Chinese), one is nominated by the Justices of the Peace from their body, and one by the Chamber of Commerce. The unofficial members vacate their seats after six years from date of appointment. The "Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890," regulates the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in Admiralty cases. The English Common Law forms the basis of the legal system, modified by Colonial Ordinances, of which a revised edition to 1901 has been issued. The law as to civil procedure was codified by Ordinance No. 3 of 1901.
