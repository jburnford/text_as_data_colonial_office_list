JAMAICA.

Situation and Area.

Jamaica is an island in the Caribbean Sea, to the southward of the eastern extremity of the Island of Cuba, within N. lat. 17° 42' and 18° 33', and W. long. 76° 10' and 78° 24'. It is the largest of the British West Indies, being 144 miles in length, and 50 in extreme breadth, and containing about 4,207 square miles, about half the size of Wales. The island is very mountainous, the main ridge running east and west, with numerous subsidiary ridges, some parallel to the main ridge, others spreading out in a N.W. and S.E. direction from it, terminating in the famous Blue Mountains in the east, the highest peak being 7,423 ft. high. There are numerous rivers and streams, with a rapid fall for the most part, and not navigable. The largest are the Black River in the south-west, and the Rio Grande in the north-east. Kingston, the capital, with a population of 48,504 in 1891, is situated on the south coast of the Island, and has a fine harbour. In St. Ann's Parish, in the middle part of the island, on the north of the main ridge, is the Roaring River, so called on account of its many picturesque waterfalls.

The Cayman Islands, lying between 19° 10' and 19° 45' N. lat., and 79° 30' and 80° 35' W. long, are dependencies of Jamaica.* Pedro and Morant Cays are also dependencies, being two guano islands in 17° N. lat., as well as the Turks and Caicos Islands.†

It is estimated that Jamaica contains 2,692,480 acres, from which may be deducted 80,000 acres as useless for agriculture, consisting chiefly of swamps, rocks, and inaccessible lands, leaving 2,612,480 acres available for cultivation. Of this 894,638 acres are returned as under cultivation in 1908-9. The dependencies have an area of 89 miles.

History.

The island was discovered by Columbus on the 3rd May, 1494. He called it St. Jago, after the patron saint of Spain, but the new name was soon dropped in favour of the native one of Jamaica (Xaymaca—well watered). The first settlement on it was effected on the shores of St. Ann's Bay, by Esquivel in 1509, under the direction of Diego, the son of Columbus, while Governor of Hispaniola. Although invaded by Sir Anthony Shirley in 1596, and by Colonel Jackson in 1638, it remained in the possession of the Spaniards for 161 years, when it was again attacked by a force sent by Cromwell, under Admiral Penn and General Venables, against Hispaniola.

and capitulated, after a trifling resistance, on the 11th May, 1655. Until the Restoration, Jamaica remained under military jurisdiction, but in 1660 a regular civil government was established by Charles II., who appointed General Edward D'Oyley Governor-in-Chief, with an Elective Council. In 1670 peace was made with Spain, and the title of England to Jamaica was recognised by the Treaty of Madrid. The colony grew fast, stimulated by the wealth brought into it by the buccaneers, who made Port Royal their headquarters and storehouse. This town was engulfed in the great earthquake of 1692. Kingston then consisted of a few sheds, and St. Jago de la Vega (Spanish town) became practically the capital. During the 18th century the island suffered from hurricanes, earthquakes, numerous slave insurrections, as well as wars with the maroons, or mountaineers, the descendants of African slaves left by the Spaniards, who inhabited mainly the east of the island, among the Blue Mountains. When the Slave Trade was abolished, in 1807, there were 323,827 slaves in Jamaica. During the last eight years of the trade, 80,821 slaves were imported. On the abolition of slavery in 1833, Jamaica received £6,161,927 of the £20,000,000 granted by the Imperial Government as compensation to the slave-owners. A serious rebellion among the black population in 1865 was suppressed by Governor Eyre with unnecessary violence, and he was recalled. In January, 1867, Kingston was devastated by a terrible earthquake, which caused great loss of life and immense destruction of property. A Mansion House Fund was opened, and contributions poured in from all parts of the Empire for the relief of distress. A free grant of £150,000 was voted by Parliament, and a loan of £800,000, chiefly in aid of re-building, was authorised from the Home Exchequer. Two buildings, the General Post Office and Treasury, and the King's House, the official residence of the Governor, were completed in 1910, and the Law Courts are being built.

Climate and Inhabitants.

There is great variety of climate; the mean temperature of Kingston is 78°8', rising to 87°5' in the daytime, and falling to 70°8' at night. As the temperature falls about 1° for every 300 feet of ascent, it is possible, in a few hours, to reach, in the central range of mountains, a cool and delightful climate. From Kingston, the capital, a change of 10° or 15° in temperature can be attained by a ride of three hours.

The rainy seasons occur generally and over the whole of the island in May and October, and last for about three weeks; but besides these heavy and periodical rainfalls, the ground is refreshed by continual showers; and in the N.E. portion of the island there is usually a rainy season at the end of the year, and light rains generally during the month of August. The mean annual rainfall varies throughout the island from about 34 inches to as much as 183 inches at Fellowship and 240 inches at Moore Town, both on the northern slope of the Blue Mountain Range.

Only two per cent. of the inhabitants are white; the remainder are chiefly of African descent, four-fifths being pure negroes. There are about 14,000 imported coolies, and about 481 Chinese (in 1897). English is universally spoken.

Constitution.

The original Constitution, granted by Charles II. in 1662, which, after existing for nearly 200 years, was surrendered in 1866, was a representative one, consisting of a Governor, a Privy Council, a Legislative Council, and an Assembly of 47 elected members. The depression caused by the abolition of slavery led to a grave constitutional crisis, the Assembly refusing to vote supplies, and endeavouring to enforce sweeping reductions in establishments, without compensation to the displaced officers. Lord Melbourne's Government, in 1839, actually introduced a Bill into Parliament for the suspension of the constitution, but was defeated, and it was not till 1854 that, by a change in the constitution of the Council, harmony was temporarily restored.

After the suppression of the rebellion in 1865, Governor Eyre, at the meeting of the Legislature, urged the unsuitability of the then existing form of Government to meet the circumstances of the community, and the necessity of making some sweeping change, by which a strong Government might be created. The Legislature willingly responded, abrogated all the existing machinery of legislation, and left it to Her Majesty's Government to substitute any other form of Government which might be better suited to the altered circumstances of the Colony.

A Legislative Council was, by Orders in Council of the 11th June, 1866, and 11th November, 1869, established, consisting of such numbers of official and unofficial members as Her Majesty might think fit. The numbers of each were six until 1878, when they were enlarged to eight, and a ninth was added in 1881.

By Order in Council dated 19th May, 1884, and Amending Order of 3rd October, 1895, the constitution was fixed in the following manner:

The Council to consist of the Governor (with only a casting vote) and five ex-officio members, viz.: the Senior Military Officer, the Colonial Secretary, Attorney-General, Director of Public Works and Collector-General, and such other persons, not exceeding ten in number, as Her Majesty may from time to time appoint, or as the Governor may from time to time provisionally appoint, and fourteen persons to be elected as therein provided. The Council shall be dissolved at the end of five years from the last preceding general election, if it shall not have been previously dissolved.

There is also a Privy Council, with the usual powers and functions of an executive council. It consists of the Lieutenant-Governor, if any, the Senior Military Officer in command, the Colonial Secretary, and Attorney-General and such other persons, not to exceed eight in number, as may be named by the King, or provisionally appointed by the Governor subject to the approval of His Majesty. The Governor is to preside at each meeting, and the Governor and two members form a quorum.

Local Administration.

There are elective Parochial Boards in the town of Kingston and 14 other parishes, under Laws 13 of 1900 and 17 of 1901, with jurisdiction over roads, markets, sanitation, poor relief, waterworks, and pounds. The chief towns are Kingston (population, in 1891, 48,504), Port Royal (population 1,200), Spanish Town (population 5,689), Montego Bay (population 4,651), Falmouth (population 3,029), and Port Maria (population 6,741).

The parish is the unit of local government, and each parish has its own parochial institutions, viz., poorhouses, &c., &c., managed by the Parochial Board of the parish, the members of which are elected by the persons entitled to vote for the
election of members of the Legislative Council. The administration of poor relief by the Parochial Boards is controlled by a Board of Supervision. The several direct taxes received on property, horses, carriages, &c., are devoted mainly to the parish in which they are collected, with the exception of a few minor items, and a tax of 8d. in every 10l. of the gross value of the property, which go to the credit of the general revenue of the colony.

The total revenue of all the local bodies in 1909-10 was 144,100l.; their expenditure 153,200l., and their debt at the end of the year 32,935l. These figures form part of the general revenue and expenditure, as given below.

There is a High Court of Justice and Petty Sessions of magistrates throughout the island. The Resident Magistrates, besides holding courts of their own, preside in the courts of Petty Sessions.

An "Island medical service," under the control of a superintending medical officer, was established in 1870. The several medical practitioners, who receive a retaining fee or salary from the Government, are designated "district medical officers." They are located throughout the island, and for the fixed salary paid by Government they have to attend sick paupers, parochial hospitals and almshouses, the constabulary officers and men, and prisons.

The Colonial revenue is derived mainly from import duties on food stuffs, alcohol, and an ad valorem duty; the excise on rum (107,945l. in 1909-10) and stamps and licences. Direct taxation is levied on properties principally for parochial purposes, but a uniform rate of 8d. in every 10l. value collected for General Revenue yielded 35,010l.

Police.

The Constabulary was placed on its present footing in 1867, and is modelled on the system of the Royal Irish Constabulary, and "partially under military organisation and discipline." There are on the authorised strength 20 officers (inspectors and sub-inspectors), under an Inspector-General, and 933 sub-officers and men, and 897 district constables distributed throughout the island. The force has been strengthened by the addition of sub-officers selected from the Royal Irish Constabulary.

Currency and Banking.

British currency and United States gold are legal tender. Accounts are kept in sterling, and the coin in circulation is almost exclusively British silver and Jamaica nickel pence. Total estimated coin 300,000l. The Colonial Bank and the Bank of Nova Scotia are the only private banking establishments in the Colony. The Colonial Bank has one branch and 4 agencies; it had an average note circulation in 1909 of 71,462l. The Bank of Nova Scotia has one branch and 5 sub-branches, and had an average note circulation in 1909 of 83,299l. British silver coins above 6d. are legal tender to any extent; coins of 6d. and less amount to the extent of 40s. in any one payment.

Government savings banks were instituted in all the principal towns in 1871, the rate of interest allowed being at first 4 per cent., but this was reduced in 1881 to 3 per cent., and in 1897 to 2½ per cent. The total deposits on 31st March, 1910, were 355,570l.

Education.

Elementary education is largely left to private enterprise, aided, since 1867, by a system of grants-in-aid from the Colonial revenue, but during recent years several Government elementary schools have been established. The number of schools is 693, with 57,849 scholars in average attendance, and the grant-in-aid for 1909-1910 was 47,399l.; no fees are charged. The Government maintains a system of inspection, and provides a training college for female teachers which is wholly supported from public funds, besides largely assisting the Mico undenominational college for male teachers, and two denominational colleges for female teachers. About 130 students are now under training. By laws passed in 1892 a Board of Education has been constituted, and provision made for the opening of Government secondary schools where required; there are two such schools receiving aid from public funds. A beginning has been made in providing from public funds for technical education; there are several endowed schools and three scholarships tenable at English and other universities.

Industry.

Fruit, consisting of bananas, oranges, &c., is now one of the largest exports, the output of oranges in 1909 being 33,136,600, with a value of 31,953l., and that of bananas being 16,712,210 stems, with a value of 1,403,829l.

The other chief crops are sugar (export 197,888 cwt., value 118,733l.); coffee (export 73,638 cwt., value 127,120l.); ginger (export 20,115 cwt., value 36,710l.); pimento (export 95,374 cwt., value 68,351l.); and the exports comprise, in addition to those products, rum (export 1,652,832 gallons, value 234,151l.); dyewood (export 27,852 tons, value 57,098l.); cocoa (export 59,485 cwt., value 110,048l.). The area under sugar cane in 1909 was 30,153 acres, and under coffee 25,230. There are 150 acres of Government cinchona plantations. Area under banana cultivation, 69,066 acres.

The coffee plantations are mainly on the Blue Mountain Range. The great fruit growing district is in Portland, with Port Antonio for its outlet. Sugar is largely grown in the district of Vere in Clarendon parish, and in the seaward parts of St. James and Trelawney, where the best rum in the world is produced. The cattle-raising districts are in St. Ann's, and in Hanover and Westmoreland and the western part of St. James. The uplands of Manchester parish are rich in coffee and fruit. St. Elizabeth parish grows a large quantity of logwood and other dye woods, as well as maize and fine pasture for horses.

The cultivation of cotton has recently been undertaken. There are 62 acres now under cultivation. The exports for 1909 reached 21,914 lbs.

The chief imports are food stuffs, clothing, hardware, alcohol, and building materials. Of the total trade of the island by far the greater portion is with the United States and the United Kingdom, Canada being next in importance.

The following are the figures for 1909-10:

| Imports | Exports |
|---------|---------|
| United Kingdom | £1,126,452 | £556,824 |
| United States | £1,163,898 | £1,617,193 |
| Canada | £174,587 | £123,630 |
Means of Communication.

There is a daily postal service throughout the island.

The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters, Newspapers. | d. |
|----------------------|----|
| Within the Colony, per 1 oz. | 1 ½d. each. |
| To places* in Imperial Penny Postage | 1 ½d. per 2 oz. |
| To other Postal Union countries, per 1 oz. | 2½d. per 2 oz. |

Parcels post with England and British W.I. Colonies,† with United States, Canal Zone, and Canada, 6d. per lb.

The estimated number of letters sent to the United Kingdom is 257,424, and the number sent to other places 759,467.

There is regular and frequent communication between Europe and Jamaica. The Royal Mail steamers leave Southampton on every alternate Wednesday throughout the year. The average passage is 21 days. The Royal Mail cargo steamers leave Southampton on 11th and 23rd of the month. Messrs. Elder’s and Fyffe’s steamers sail every Tuesday, alternately from Manchester and Bristol. The voyage takes 16 days. The Leyland Line Steamers (West India and Pacific Branch) leave Liverpool on the 10th of each month, their average passage being 21 days. There is also frequent steam communication between the United States and Jamaica.

Telegraphic communication with Europe is complete. Jamaica is the first British possession in the West Indies which the two cables from Cuba touch at, whence they branch away via St. Thomas, to Demerara, and in the opposite direction to the Isthmus of Panama. On 31st January, 1898, the Direct West India Cable Company established communication between Jamaica and Halifax via Bermuda and Turks Island.

A line of inland telegraph, connecting all the principal towns, and having 76 telegraph and telephone stations, is now in operation. The total mileage open is 897, 375½ miles along roads, 137 miles P.O. lines on railway, and 184½ along railway lines. The total cost of the telegraphs has been about 20,324l. The receipts in 1908-9 were 6,220l. 17s. 9d.

The railway extends from Kingston to Montego Bay, in the parish of Saint James, a distance of 112½ miles, and to Ewarton, in the parish of St. Catherine, in the other direction, by a branch line from Spanish Town of 17½ miles; and to Port Antonio by a branch line from Bogwalk, on the Ewarton branch, of 54½ miles. The total length of line open is 184½ miles. The railway was purchased by an American syndicate, who, under agreement, extended it to Port Antonio on the north-east, and to Montego Bay on the north-west, but the company having failed, the Government resumed possession of the line on 16th August, 1900. The total railway debt charge, providing for interest and repayment, is 117,891l. The receipts in 1909-10 exceeded the expenditure by 53,283l., leaving a deficiency, after providing for the above charge, of 64,408l. There is also a line of telegraph along the railway from Kingston to Montego Bay, 113 miles; Spanish Town to Ewarton, 17½ miles; and from Bogwalk to Port Antonio, 54½ miles.

The island is intersected by a system of main roads, the condition of which will bear favourable comparison with those in many European countries. There are 1,978 miles of main roads, and about 4,318 miles of parochial roads.

A weekly steam communication round the island to the principal outports has been established. The circuit is completed within 120 hours.

Kingston, Montego Bay, Falmouth, Sav-la-Mar, and St. Ann’s Bay are ports of registry. During the year ended 31st March, 1910, one ship was registered at Kingston.

CAYMAN ISLANDS.

The Cayman Islands (a dependency of Jamaica) consist of three islands, Grand Cayman, Little Cayman, and Cayman Brac, lying between 79° 44' and 80° 26' W. longitude, and 19° 44', and 19° 46' N. latitude. They were discovered by Columbus, on his return voyage from Porto Bello to Hispaniola, but were never occupied by the Spaniards. The English took possession of them soon after the conquest of Jamaica, and they were mainly colonised from that island.

Grand Cayman is distant about 178 miles from the nearest point of Jamaica. It is 17 miles in length, and varies from 4 to 7 miles in breadth. The coasts are for the most part rock-bound, protected by coral reefs and enclosing some fair-sized harbours. One on the north side of the island, called the Great Sound, measures over six miles across.

The principal industry of the inhabitants is catching turtle. These turtle are brought to the island and placed in "kraals," to recover and fatten before being sent to their next stage, Jamaica, from whence they are exported. Over 5,000 turtles a year are thus disposed of at an average price of 1L each.

The Island of Grand Cayman is in some parts fruitful, and the usual tropical products are grown, but a considerable average is traversed by cliffs, and unfit for cultivation. Mahogany, cedar and other valuable timber and some dye-woods are found in quantities. Phosphate deposits of some value exist, and were worked, but have lately been neglected.

There are two towns, Georgetown and Bodden-town, and several villages. The population of Grand Cayman numbered 4,322 at the census of 1891.

The smaller Cayman Islands, viz., Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, are about 70 miles distant from Grand Cayman; they are almost entirely given up to the growth of cocoanuts. Their inhabitants numbered at the last reckoning 60 and 528 persons respectively.

The proportion of white inhabitants in the Cayman Islands is much larger than in most parts of the West Indies.

Fine schooners of native woods are continually being constructed at these islands for sale and for local use, the people being first-rate ship-wrights.

The Legislative Assembly of the Cayman Islands consists of the Justices of the Peace and elected Vestrymen, and the laws passed by this body are subject to the assent of the Governor of Jamaica before becoming operative.

The government of the Dependency is administered by a Commissioner.
