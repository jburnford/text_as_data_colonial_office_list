NEWFOUNDLAND.

(See map under Canada.)

Situation and Area.

Newfoundland is an island situated between 46° 37' and 51° 39' N. lat., and 52° 35' and 59° 25' W. long., on the north-east side of the Gulf of St. Lawrence; the greatest length from north to south is 350 miles, and average breadth about 130; its estimated area is 42,000 square miles, or one-third of that of the United Kingdom.

Labrador.

Labrador, from Hudson's Strait to Blanc Sablon (Strait of Belle Isle), including the basin of the Hamilton, is, under Letters Patent of 28th March, 1876, included in the Colony, the remainder of the Labrador peninsula forming part of Canada. The area is about 120,000 square miles (equal to that of the United Kingdom), with a coast line of some 600 miles. The outside coast line is bleak, but the shores of the bays and rivers are well wooded, and in some cases densely so, the timber being high and sound, the temperature of the interior being, as a rule, like that of northern Canada. There are about 4,000 permanent inhabitants (some 1,300 Eskimo, the remainder of British descent), occupied in the fisheries and in trapping. The population is greatly increased in summer by fishermen and sportsmen, over 1,000 vessels being employed. Battle Harbour (Strait of Belle Isle) is the chief port, the other villages being the Moravian Mission stations (commenced 1770) at Hopedale, Nain, Okkak, Hebron, Raman, and Killinek. The Customs duties are those of Newfoundland.

Labrador, discovered by the Norseman Lief, son of Eric the Red, in A.D. 1,000, and (in 1497) by Cabot, was early frequented by Basque, and subsequently by Breton, fishermen. It became British on the conquest of Canada (1759). In 1763 the Atlantic coast was annexed to Newfoundland, but was temporarily re-annexed to Quebec from 1773 to 1809. The first judicial court was established in 1824; it was revived in 1863, but has been discontinued for some years past. During the summer months several Justices of the Peace are upon the coast.

History.

The island was discovered by John Cabot in 1497; it was as early as 1500 frequented by the Portuguese, Spanish, and French, for its fisheries. Sir Walter Raleigh and others, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, attempted to colonise this island, but were not successful. In 1623, Sir G. Calvert, afterwards Lord Baltimore, established himself in the Peninsula of Avalon, the south-east part of the island, and appointed his son Governor. In 1634 a party of colonists were sent over from Ireland, and twenty years after, some English colonists arrived, having emigrated by means of a Parliamentary grant.

The French, about 1620, established a station at Placentia; and for many years the French and English settlers were constantly annoying each other. At the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, subsequently ratified by the Treaty of Paris, the exclusive sovereignty of Newfoundland was acknowledged to belong to Great Britain, certain rights being granted to French fishermen, the extent of which long remained in question between the two nations. The French possess the small islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, and the district is resorted to annually by a French fishing fleet from St. Malo, Granville, St. Brieuc, Bordeaux, Quimper, St. Nazaire, &c. They claimed the exclusive right to fish along the coast from Cape John on the east coast round the north to Cape Ray on the west coast, upon which they were allowed temporary structures for drying the fish. That this right was an exclusive one was never admitted by Great Britain, which also contended that it did not include a right to the lobster fishery. By the declaration attached to the Treaty of Versailles in 1783, the King of Great Britain undertook to remove the fixed fishery settlements on the part of the coast to which the French rights extend. A proposal for the settlement of all the questions was agreed to in 1885 by commissioners representing France and England, but was rejected by Newfoundland. An agreement for the reference to arbitration of the lobster fishery question was signed in 1891, but the law approving it did not pass the French Chamber. Pending the arbitration, the modus vivendi, which had been adopted in 1890, limiting the erection of new factories, was renewed. The Colony reluctantly passed legislation in 1891 for enforcing it for three years, but rejected the draft permanent Bill for giving effect to the treaty obligations in the session of 1892. The Act was first continued to 31st December, 1895, then to 31st December, 1897, and in 1897 it was further continued to 31st December, 1898. By legislation passed in each subsequent session the Act of 1891 was continued until the 31st day of December.

The dispute was finally settled by the Anglo-French Convention of the 8th April, 1904, in connection with other outstanding questions between the two countries. Under that Convention, France renounced the privileges under Art. xiii. of the Treaty of Utrecht (see Cd. 1952). The arrangement will be of great benefit to the Colony, since it removes an obstruction to local development, to mining and other industrial enterprises, over some two-fifths of the whole coast line.

Industries.

The industries of the island—fishing, agricultural, mining and lumbering—are mainly confined to the sea coast. Copper is largely worked for export at Tilt Cove and Little Bay, iron pyrites at Pilley's Island, on the N.E. coast, and asbestos in the interior from Port-au-Port, west coast, and lead, silver, coal, and gold are also found. Immense beds of hematite iron ore have been laid bare at Bell Island, Conception Bay, and large quantities are being exported.

The establishment of large and well-equipped paper mills at Grand Falls, in the interior, by the Anglo-Newfoundland Development Company, has opened up a very large industry. The paper and paper pulp is shipped to the United Kingdom and used in the principal London printing offices. Mr. Mayson M. Beeton, the president of the company, has been instrumental in laying out a model town, which is well lighted, watered, and drained. It is very picturesquely situated, and is on the line of the Reid Newfoundland Company's railway through the interior, while a private line of rail connects the works with Botwood, the principal port on the Exploits for summer shipments.
The Albert Reid Company, of London, are building a large pulp mill at Bishop's Falls, about nine miles from Grand Falls, where pulp will be manufactured for English mills.

The cod-fishery is the staple industry, and after this in importance rank the fisheries for seal, lobster, herring, and salmon. Haddock and mackerel are now only taken occasionally. The cod appears off the coast early in May, and the fishery extends north for over 1,000 miles, including the coast of Labrador, the grounds varying in depth from 50 to 360 feet. The home consumption is about 300,000 quintals, and the export in 1908-9 was 1,732,387 quintals, value $7,398,536; 30 bank cod go, on an average, to one quintal. A fair average of fish (general run) per quintal would be 125. The export is mainly to Portugal, Spain, Brazil, Italy, Greece, and the United Kingdom. The chief imports are flour, textiles, woollens and cottons, hardware, cutlery, salt pork, molasses, butter, and salt. These are obtained mainly from Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Currency and Banking.

Branch banks of the Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, and Royal Bank of Canada have been opened in St. John's, a branch of the Bank of Nova Scotia in Harbour Grace, and of the Bank of Montreal at Bay of Islands.

The legal tender currency (see Act IV. of 1895) is British sterling, United States gold and Colonial coins. Silver is legal tender to the extent of $10, and copper to the amount of 25 cents. Much of the trade is carried on by barter. Accounts are kept in dollars and cents. Exchange $4·80 to the pound sterling.

Means of Communication.

There is a railway from St. John's to Harbour Grace, 84 miles in length, the property of the Government. The total approximate cost of construction was $2,500,000. A branch line has been constructed by the Government, connecting with Placentia. Its length is 27 miles, and it was built at a cost of $525,000. The railway to the Exploits River, a distance of 200 miles, was built at a cost of $3,120,000. The line from Exploits, via Bay of Islands and Bay St. George, to Port-aux-Basques (a distance of 285 miles approximately) is completed, the cost being $4,446,000. Branch lines to Brigus, Tilton, Carbonear, and Burnt Bay are also completed. The total length of these lines, with branches, is about 638 miles. Other branch lines are being constructed to Trinity, Bonavista, Hearts' Content, Trepassey, Fortune, Bay and Bonne Bay, in all about 300 miles. By the transinsular railway regular connection is made with the continent three times a week, the intervening strait being crossed in the first-class passenger steamer "Bruce," which makes the passage in six hours. About 750 miles of postal and 1,700 miles of district roads are maintained. There are 3,088 miles of telegraph open. The Government cable, laid in 1905 between Port-aux-Basques and Canoe in Nova Scotia, gives quick communication with both America and Europe. The Anglo-American cables start for Europe (at Hearts' Content) and America (at Placentia). The Commercial cable is landed at St. John's, the District cable at Harbour Grace, and the Western Union at Bay Roberts, and all connect with both Europe and America. There is a fortnightly mail service (except in February, March and April) with Liverpool by the Allan line, and at irregular intervals by other steamers. Constant connection by water with Montreal, Halifax, and New York is made by private lines of steamers. The south and west coast has a weekly steamer service from Placentia, and also a fortnightly service per steamer from St. John's. One steamer makes fortnightly trips from St. John's to the Labrador Coast with mails and passengers during the summer, and another makes fortnightly trips between St. John's and Grignon in the north of the island, calling at all the important intermediate settlements. Smaller steamers ply on the five great bays, while another steamer visits each week the ports in the Strait of Belle Isle. All these steamers make close connection with the railway.

The rates of postage are as follows:

| Letters, Newspapers |
|---------------------|
| In St. John's . . . | 1 cent. Free if under |
| Within Colony . . . | 2 cents. ,, / 4 oz. |
| To United Kingdom and certain Colonies* | 2 ,, 1 cent. for 2 oz. |
| Other Colonies . . . | 5 ,, 1 ,, ditto. |
| Europe and St. Pierre, Miquelon | 5 cents. for 1st oz. 3 cents. ,, ditto. |
| South America . . . | per succeeding oz. |
| To United States . . | 2 cents. |

Climate.

The climate is milder than that of Canada; the mean temperature at St. John's in the year 1906 was 42°, the extreme range being from 0° to 81°. There is an almost total absence of spring, the summer setting in very suddenly in May. The rainfall in 1906 was 64 inches. Two-thirds of the inhabitants are descended from the British settlers, English being everywhere spoken, but about one-third belong to the Roman Catholic religion, and a small number of these are of French extraction. The last of the aboriginal inhabitants died out about 1829; they were of the Bethuk tribe.

Education.

The Government system of primary education rests upon the Act of 1903. The central administration is vested in three superintendents, belonging respectively to the Roman Catholic, the Anglican, and the Methodist denominations. The local management is in the hands of appointed boards. There were, in 1909, 999 schools, with 47,335 scholars. The schools are denominational, and fees are charged. Grants are also made in aid of secondary schools, and in the session of 1905 a small vote of $3,767 was passed for technical education. In 1910 a special grant of $100,000 was made for the erection, re-modelling and equipment of school buildings in places outside the city of St. John's.

In 1883 an Act was passed appointing a council of higher education, and empowering them to adopt certain rules and regulations with the object of fostering higher education in the Colony. A sum of money in aid of the council is annually granted by the Legislature.

* See end of Introduction. A new rate for postage on magazines, etc., from U.K. to Newfoundland came into effect, December 1st, 1900—a reduction from 4d. to 1d.
Chief Towns.

The capital is St. John's, with 31,501 inhabitants. The next port in importance is Harbour Grace, with a population of 5,184; Twillingate has 3,542; Bonavista 3,696; and Carbonear 3,703 inhabitants. St. John's, which had similarly suffered in 1846, was almost completely destroyed by fire in 1892, the Cathedral and many Government buildings being burnt down, with the public records which they contained. The town has been rebuilt in an improved manner.

Constitution.

Newfoundland has had a Legislature since 1832, but it was the last of the North American Colonies to which responsible Government was conceded; it was established in 1855. The Government is at present administered by a Governor, aided by a responsible Executive Council in which the Governor presides, a Legislative Council, and a House of Assembly of 36 members, elected by ballot under manhood suffrage. There are—registration 1904—54,630 electors registered on the electoral roll, and 18 districts, or subdivisions of districts, of which 7 return three members, 4 return two members, and 7 return one. There is a property qualification for members, viz., property exceeding 500l. in amount or value, or a net annual income of 100l. The ordinary duration of the restricted session is about three months, and the Legislature generally meets about the middle of February.

Members of the Council receive $120 each (President $240) per session. Members of the Assembly receive the following pay per session:—(1) Those living in St. John's, $200; (2) those living in the outports, $300. The Speaker receives $750. This pay to the Legislature is provided for annually in a local Act. The town of St. John's is governed by a municipal council consisting of a mayor and six councillors elected every four years by the citizens.

NEW ZEALAND.

Situation and Area.

By a Proclamation of His Majesty the King, published in the London Gazette, the Colony of New Zealand is to be styled "the Dominion of New Zealand" on and from the 26th September, 1907.

The Dominion of New Zealand consists of three principal islands, called respectively the North, the South, and Stewart Islands. There are several small islets (mostly uninhabited) dependent on the Dominion: the chief of these are the Chatham Isles, 536 miles eastward of Lyttelton, in 43°-45° S. lat., 176°-177° W. long. (Chatham and Pitt are the principal islets); and the Auckland Isles. The main group lies between 33° and 53° S. lat., and 162° E. long. and 173° W. long. The three principal islands extend in length 1,100 miles, but their breadth is extremely variable, ranging from 46 miles to 250 miles, the average being about 140 miles. The area of the North Island is 44,468 square miles, of the South Island, 58,525 square miles, of Stewart Island, 665 square miles, and small outlying groups of islands, 1,093 square miles, a total area of 104,751 square miles (twice the size of England).

In April, 1842, by Royal Letters Patent, and again by the Act 26 & 27 Vict., cap. 23, all islands between 162° E. and 173° W. long., and 33° and 53° S. lat., are annexed to New Zealand.

By letters patent, dated 18th January, 1887, the group called the Kermadec Islands, situated about 614 miles N.E. of the Bay of Islands, were annexed to New Zealand. These are a chain of widely separated islets, lying between 29° and 32° S. lat., and 177° and 180° W. long. The principal are Raoul or Sunday, and Macaulay, the next in size being Curtis and Esperance. Raoul comprises 12 square miles, is covered with forest, and rises to a height of 1,720 feet.

The Protectorate over the Cook Islands was administered through the Governor of New Zealand until 1900; in October of that year the group was annexed to Her Majesty's Dominions, and resolutions were passed by the New Zealand Parliament for the extension of the boundary of the Dominion to include the group as well as Savage Island and other small islands. By proclamation finally fixing the date from which the boundaries of New Zealand are deemed to be extended, from the 11th June, 1901, the following islands are included:—Rarotonga, Mangaiia, Atiu, Aitutaki, Mitiaro, Mauke, Hervey (Manuae), Palmerston (Avauru), Savage (Niue), Pukapuka (Danger), Rakaanga, Manahiki, Penrhyn (Tongareva), and Suwarrow. An account of the Cook Islands is given below.

Climate.

The climate is temperate and very healthy, the average death rate being less than 10 per 1,000. The temperature is more equable than in the British Isles. While the summers are as cool as those of England, the winters are as warm as those of Italy. The mean annual temperature at Auckland (59°) is nearly the same as at Rome; at Wellington (56°) nearly the same as at Milan; at Dunedin (51°) nearly the same as at London. The extreme range of temperature at Wellington is 50°, from 82° in summer to 32° in winter. The rainfall varies from a mean for the year of 25 inches on the east coast, to 112 inches on the west coast of the South Island, and from 37 inches on the east coast, to 59 inches on the west coast of the North Island.

The average birth rate for the 10 years 1900—1909 was 26·77 per 1,000 living, and the average death rate for the same period 9·80. The birth rate in 1909 was 27·29 per 1,000; the death rate in that year was 9·22.

History.

New Zealand was discovered in 1642 by the Dutch navigator, Tasman, who, however, did not land upon its shores. In 1769 it was visited by Captain Cook, who in that year, and during subsequent voyages, explored its coasts. The country subsequently became a resort for whalers and traders, chiefly from Australia, as well as a field for the labours of the Missionary Societies from 1814. In 1840 the native chiefs ceded the sovereignty of New Zealand to the British Crown by the Treaty of Waitangi, concluded by the British Consul, Captain Hobson, and the islands became a British colony.

The aborigines, called Maoris, are a remarkable people—a branch of the Polynesian race. According to their own traditions, their forefathers came about 600 years, or twenty generations ago, from Hawaiki, which was probably Hawaii in the Sandwich Islands, or Savaii, in the Navigator, or Samoa, group. They are divided into about twenty different clans, analogous to those of the Highlands of Scotland. There have been two Maori wars; the first lasted from 1845 until 1848; the second lasted from 1860, with little intermission, until 1870. But fully half the clans have always been friendly to the English; and many of them fought on the side of the Colonial Government against their own countrymen. Permanent tranquillity was established in 1871 throughout the country. An agitation amongst certain tribes in 1881, which threatened for a time to create a disturbance, was promptly quelled by the Colonial Government. At the census taken in 1906, the Maoris (including half-castes) amounted to 47,731, all of whom dwelt in the North Island, with the exception of some 2,558 scattered over the other islands.

Constitution.

The country was at first a dependency of New South Wales, but was separated by letters patent in 1842. Its settlement was largely effected by the New Zealand Company, with a royal charter which was surrendered in 1850.

Down to 1847 the Executive and Legislative Councils were both nominated by the Governor and constitutional form of Government was established by the Imperial Statute 15 & 16 Vict., cap. 72. By that Act New Zealand was divided into six provinces, subsequently increased to nine—viz., Auckland, Taranaki, Wellington, Nelson, Canterbury, Otago, Hawke's Bay, Westland, and Marlborough—each governed by a Superintendent and Provincial Council, elected by the inhabitants under a franchise which practically amounted to household suffrage.

By an Act of the General Assembly, 39 Vict., No. XXI., passed in 1876, the provincial system of government was abolished. The powers previously exercised by superintendents and provincial officers are now exercised by the Governor or by local boards. The provincial system being abolished, provision was made for the division of the Dominion into counties and boroughs, and the necessary machinery for their self-government was provided.

A Central Legislature, called the General Assembly, was also established by the Imperial
from 31 inches on the east coast, west coast of the North Island.

A Central Legislative Assembly was also established by the Imperial
Statute of 1852, consisting of the Governor, Legislative Council, and House of Representatives. The Governor is assisted by an Executive Council, composed of the Responsible Ministers of the Dominion for the time being, according to the usual practice of Parliamentary Government. The Legislative Councillors are appointed by the Governor, and up to 1891 held their seats for life. Under the Act passed in that year, future appointments are tenable for seven years only. The members of the House of Representatives are chosen by electors possessing a liberal franchise. Every male elector is qualified to become a member. The House of Representatives now consists of 80, including 4 Maori members, elected by the natives. The session is usually from June to October.

Payment of Members of the Legislative Council is at the rate of 200l. a year, payable monthly. Members of the House of Representatives receive 25l. a month, amounting to 300l. per annum.

The Electoral Act, 1883, extended to women (of both races) the right to register as electors, and to vote at the elections for members of the House of Representatives.

The franchise for European representation is as follows:—Every adult person, if resident one year in the Dominion and three months in one electoral district, can be registered as an elector.

The property qualification was abolished by "The Electoral Act Amendment Act, 1896," and residence alone now entitles a man or woman to have his or her name placed upon an electoral roll.

For Maori representation every adult Maori resident in the district can vote, and no registration is required. There are four Maori electoral districts.

For local bodies the qualification is a property or residential one. Women can vote as well as men.

The control of native affairs, and the entire responsibility of dealing with questions of native government were transferred in 1863 from the Imperial to the New Zealand Government. In 1865 the seat of Government was removed from Auckland to Wellington, on account of the central position of the latter city.

Local Government.

For the purposes of local government the Dominion is divided into 110 municipalities and 107 counties; the latter being subdivided into 190 road districts and 53 town districts, besides River, Drainage and Water Supply Boards. For the year ended 31st March, 1909, the total receipts of the above local authorities amounted to 3,550,697l., and their expenditure to 3,569,419l. Their outstanding loans of the same date amounted to 7,241,437l. For the year ended 31st December, 1908, the receipts, expenditure and debt of Harbour Boards amounted to 1,012,638l., 1,064,217l., and 5,052,845l. respectively, and of the Christchurch Drainage Board to 47,911l., 58,771l., and 308,200l. respectively. The Dunedin Drainage and Sewerage Board receipts 57,501l.; expenditure, 42,265l.; debt, 265,540l. The Christchurch Tramway Board receipts, 96,819l.; expenditure, 76,030l.; debt, 435,600l. for year ending 31st March, 1909.

Education.

A Government system of primary education was established by Law No. 21 of 1877. The central administration is vested in a Minister of Education, and the local control is in the hands of Education Boards, and of School Committee with functions subordinate to those of the Boards.

Number of schools on 31st December, 1909, 2,155; number of scholars on roll, 155,542 (including 8,164 Maoris or half-castes living as Maoris). The schools are free and non-sectarian, and education is compulsory. The University of New Zealand examines and confers degrees and gives scholarships. It has a statutory endowment of 3,000l. a year. There are four colleges for University teaching, at Dunedin, Christchurch, Wellington, and Auckland. All have landed endowments, and the two last-named have statutory subsidies of 4,000l. a year each. There are thirty-one bodies, endowed with land or funds arising from public sources, for the purpose of carrying on secondary education. The number of pupils on the rolls at the schools governed by these bodies for the fourth quarter of 1909 was 4,856. Twenty-eight of these schools give free places under Government regulations to 3,295 pupils. The mean average cost to the Treasury was 10l. 10s. 2d. per pupil. In scholarships, free places at secondary schools, district high schools, and technical schools and classes, over 7,000 pupils receive free secondary education.

Provision has been made for manual instruction in primary and secondary schools, and for instruction in various branches of Technology, Science and Art in connection with technical and art schools and classes. During 1909 manual instruction was given in over 1,260 primary and secondary schools, while 1,702 technical and art classes were held at over 100 centres. There are about 40 more or less fully equipped technical and art schools. 2,207 persons received free technical education under the regulations for manual and technical instruction. During 1909 the Government distributed 71,486l. in aid of various schools and classes for manual and technical instruction. The Science and Art Examinations of the Board of Education (London) and the Technological Examinations of the City and Guilds of London Institute are made use of, and 769 passes in various subjects, theoretical and practical, were obtained in 1909. In connection with the Auckland University College and the Otago University there are fully equipped Schools of Mines. There are also Schools of Mines at the Thames, Coromandel, Karangahake, Waihi, Waikino, Westport and Reefton, where mining work is actively engaged in. In connection with the Canterbury College there is an endowed School of Engineering and Technical Science. The Canterbury Agricultural College possesses extensive buildings, has a large endowment of land and an experimental farm of very complete character.

Military drill for the boys attending the primary and secondary schools is efficiently carried out under a system of cadet corps.

There are (1909) 94 schools for natives, maintained at the cost of the Government and under the direct control of the Minister, and 9 denominational boarding schools. The number at the boarding schools was 360, of whom 123 were supported by Government; and at the other schools 4,121.

Of the 2,380 children belonging to the 11 authorised industrial schools 771 were in residence and 770 were boarded out with foster-parents. The rest were at service, with friends, etc., under licence.

A school for training of the boys who are mentally feeble is now established, and there are (1909) 31 boys in residence. There will be accommodation for about 60 pupils.
The Infant Life Protection system, which provides for the supervision of children under six years who are maintained apart from their parents for fee or reward, is administered by the Education Department.

The number of pupils in the School for the Deaf at the end of 1909, was 89; the greatest part of the cost is defrayed by the Government.

To the School for the Blind, under the management of a local society, the Government contributes a subsidy to the extent, approximately, of 24s. for each 20s. subscribed, and pays 25l. a year for each pupil whom it sends to the school. There were 39 such pupils at the end of 1909.

There is a system of superannuation for school teachers, designed to give an annuity of one-sixtieth of average salary of last three years of service.

Population.

The population of New Zealand on 29th April, 1906, was found by the census to be 888,578 persons, excluding the Maoris, who numbered 47,731, and Cook and other Pacific Islands (12,340).

The population of the chief towns on the 28th March, 1886; 5th April, 1891; 12th April, 1896; 31st March, 1901; and 29th April, 1906, was as follows:

| Year | City | City and Suburbs | City | City and Suburbs |
|------|------|------------------|------|------------------|
| 1886 | Wellington | 25,945 | 27,833 | Dunedin | 23,243 | 45,518 |
|      | Auckland | 33,161 | 57,048 | Christchurch | 15,265 | 44,688 |
| 1891 | Wellington | 37,441 | 41,758 | Dunedin | 22,815 | 47,280 |
|      | Auckland | 31,424 | 57,616 | Christchurch | 16,964 | 51,330 |

|      | Auckland | 37,736 | 82,101 | Christchurch | 49,928 | 67,878 |

Industry.

All the productions of the temperate climates of Europe and Asia can be cultivated with great success in New Zealand. There are extensive coal mines and rich gold fields. The gold entered for exportation from the Dominion up to 31st December, 1909, was valued at 75,540,803l.; and the annual production is about two millions sterling. The wool exported in 1909 amounted to 189,683,703 lbs., valued at 6,305,888l. In 1855 it amounted to 1,772,344 lbs., valued at 93,104l. The trade in frozen meat, which began in 1882 with an export of 15,244 cwt., valued at 19,339l., had developed an export for 1889 of 636,822 cwt., valued at 783,374l., in 1893 to 903,836 cwt., valued at 1,085,167l., and in 1898, 1,551,773 cwt., valued at 1,698,750l., in 1901, 1,857,547 cwt., valued at 2,253,262l., in 1902, 2,138,557 cwt., valued at 2,718,763l., in 1903, 2,378,650 cwt., valued at 3,197,043l., in 1904, 1,912,979 cwt., valued at 2,703,599l.; in 1905, 1,690,684 cwt., valued at 2,694,432l.; in 1906, 2,025,507 cwt., valued at 2,877,031l.; in 1907, 2,354,108 cwt., valued at 3,420,664l.; in 1908, 2,120,303 cwt., valued at 3,188,616l.; in 1909, 2,572,604 cwt., valued at 3,601,093l. The live stock in New Zealand, as returned in 1908, were: horses, 363,259, against 99,859 in 1874; cattle, 1,773,326, against 494,917 in 1874; sheep, 23,480,707,* against 11,704,853 in 1874. The number of acres under cultivation in October, 1909, was 1,911,247, exclusive of 13,623,528 acres in sown grasses, 311,000 acres were in wheat, having an estimated yield of 8,661,100 bushels; 377,000 acres were in oats, estimated yield 13,804,000 bushels.

Auckland, Dunedin, Invercargill, Lyttelton, Napier, Nelson, and Wellington are ports of registry, and had, on 31st Dec., 1909, 589 vessels registered, of 130,840 (net) tons in the aggregate.

The imports consist chiefly of textiles, hardware and machinery, sugar, tea, alcohol, books, and stationery; and they are obtained almost entirely from England, Australia, the United States, Germany, Belgium, Canada, Ceylon, Japan and China.

Banking and Currency.

The following banks have branches in the Dominion:—Bank of New Zealand, National Bank of New Zealand (Limited), Union Bank of Australia (Limited), Bank of New South Wales, and Bank of Australasia. The total amount of their deposits in New Zealand on 31st Dec., 1909, was 22,196,171l., and of their note circulation 1,573,954l. There is also a Post Office Savings Bank established in the Dominion, having now 619 branches; the amount deposited therein on 31st December, 1909, was 12,666,898l. The private savings banks number five, and the total amount to credit of depositors at the end of 1909 was 1,398,512l.

The currency and legal tender is exclusively British sterling.

Government Insurance Department.

This department was constituted on the initiative of the late Sir J. Vogel, by legislative enactments passed in 1869 and 1870, and commenced to transact business in March of the latter year. Its constitution was subsequently modified by Acts passed in 1874, 1884, 1886, 1888, 1890, 1891, 1893, 1894 and 1899, now consolidated by the Act of 1908. By the Act of 1886 an official board to control and manage the investment of a portion of the department's funds in mortgages on land, was constituted. This board consists of the Minister of Finance, the Solicitor-General, the Surveyor-General, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Public Trustee, and the Government Insurance Commissioner. The Act of 1894 empowers loans on mortgage not exceeding 10,000l. to any one person or company. All policies are guaranteed by the State.

By an Act passed in 1899 a separate branch of the department was constituted for the purpose of transacting Personal Accident Insurance and Employers' Liability Insurance.

The conditions under which policies are issued are very liberal, whilst the premium rates are extremely low. Insurances are effected on individual first-class lives to the amount of 5,000l., and in the case of the Accident Branch to the amount of 1,000l. All profits belong absolutely and entirely to the policy holders themselves.

Government Accident Insurance.

The Accident Branch of the Government Insurance Department was opened in 1901. General accident business is undertaken, but the

* April, 1909.
branch was opened more especially with a view to relieve employers of labour of the liability imposed upon them by "The Workers' Compensation for Accidents Act, 1900." This Act greatly extended the liability of employers, and gave to a workman the right of compensation for all injuries arising out of, and in the course of, his employment, not attributable to his own serious and wilful misconduct.

This liability has been more or less extended by subsequent Acts, and under "The Workers' Compensation Act, 1908," which came into operation on the 1st January, 1909, the scale of compensation is as follows:

(a.) Where death results from the injury and the workman leaves dependants wholly dependent upon his earnings, the compensation is one hundred and fifty-six times his average weekly earnings, but not to be less than 200l., nor to exceed 500l.

(b.) If the dependants are only partially dependent upon the workman's earnings, the compensation is to be three times the value of the benefits they have received from the deceased worker during the previous twelve months, but not exceeding the amount payable under paragraph (a).

(c.) In either of the above cases the employer is also liable for medical and burial expenses not exceeding 20l., and an amount not exceeding this sum can be claimed where there are no dependants.

(d.) Where a workman is totally incapacitated for work, he is entitled to a weekly payment of one-half his average weekly earnings, but the weekly compensation is not to be less than 1l. in cases where the worker's earnings at the time of the accident are not less than 30s. per week, nor can the weekly payment exceed 2l. 10s., as any worker whose earnings are more than 5l. per week is excluded from the benefits of the Act.

(e.) Where the workman is partially incapacitated only, the compensation is one-half the loss of wages.

The compensation is payable from the date of the accident where the incapacity lasts for fourteen days or more, but if the duration of the incapacity is less than fourteen days, no payment is made for the first week.

Weekly payments are not to extend over a longer period than six years, and the aggregate amount is not to exceed 500l.

Special provision is made in the case of wharf labourers, and also for increased compensation to persons under the age of twenty-one, who are permanently incapacitated.

Certain diseases due to the nature of the trade, such as anthrax, lead poisoning, mercury poisoning, etc., are regarded as accidents.

If the accident occurs in the course of employment in or about a mine, building, factory, or ship, the compensation becomes a charge on the employer's interest in the property. In nearly all cases this charge takes precedence of all existing or subsequent charges or encumbrances howsoever created.

The Department's policies cover the full liability of an employer to his workmen under the Workers' Compensation Act, and the liability under common law to the extent of 500l. per man.

The premiums are assessed on the wages, and vary from 3s. 6d. and 4s. 6d. per 100l. of wages for the lightest occupations to 22s. per cent. for building trades, 49s. 6d. per cent. for coal mines to cover accidents only, and 93s. 6d. per cent. for bushfelling.

Policies protecting mortgages from loss through the charge of an injured workman taking precedence of a mortgage are issued at premiums varying from 1s. per cent. of the mortgage for small mortgages to 6d. per cent. for large mortgages.

Personal accident policies are also issued securing amounts for accidental death and permanent total or partial disablement, and weekly allowances during temporary disablement.

The premium income and claims of the Accident Branch since the commencement of business have been as follows:

| Year                  | Premium Income | Claims |
|-----------------------|----------------|--------|
| 7th June to 31st Dec., 1901 | 11,856         | 2,428  |
| Year ending 31st Dec., 1902 | 14,100         | 7,364  |

The funds, assets, and liabilities of the Government Insurance Department belonging to its Accident Insurance Branch are kept separate and distinct from the main life insurance business, and powers are vested in the Governor to make regulations in regard to tables fixing rates of premium and other details for the conduct of the Accident Insurance Branch.

State Fire Insurance.

In the year 1903 was passed an Act "to establish a State Fire Insurance Office and to make other provisions for the insurance and protection of insurable property in New Zealand against loss or damage by fire."

The statute provided for the establishment of an office to be administered by a General Manager appointed by the Governor, and for the necessary staff—not subject to the laws regulating the Civil Service.

Provision is made for the constitution of a Board, to consist of the General Manager, the Minister of Finance, the Government Insurance Commissioner, and two other persons (not being in the Civil Service) appointed by the Governor. The latter hold office for two years, with eligibility for re-appointment, and are remunerated according to appropriation by Parliament.

The Department opened for business with branches and agencies throughout the Dominion in January, 1905, and the net income and net losses for each of the five years ending 31st December, 1909, have been as follows:

| Year | Net Income, less Re-insurances | Net Losses |
|------|-------------------------------|------------|
| 1905 | 13,135                        | 2,417      |

Public Works.

All the more important public works of New Zealand are in the hands of the Government and other public bodies, comparatively few having been undertaken by companies. The initiation of public works in New Zealand is coeval with the founding of the Colony. In the early days they simply kept pace with the spread of settlement, but in 1870 a great impetus was given to the progress of the country by the inauguration of the "Public Works Policy," which provided for carrying out works in advance of settlement, and for immigration.

The first public works initiated were roads, many thousands of miles having been constructed in all directions. Some of the main roads through sparsely settled districts were made, and are still maintained by the Government, but the ordinary main roads are under the control of the counties, and the district roads under road boards. Nearly all the larger rivers on the main roads in both islands are bridged. A few, however, have ferries worked by the current.

At the end of the last financial year, 31st March, 1910, there were 2,717 miles of Government and 29 miles of private railways in operation in New Zealand, and 150 miles of Government under construction. The construction of new lines and the extension of existing ones is still steadily proceeding.

The expenditure on the 2,717 miles of Government railways has been 28,513,476L., or an average of 10,494L. a mile. This includes all charges connected with the construction and equipment of the lines.

The revenue from the Government railways for the year 1909-1910 was 3,249,790L., and the working expenses 2,169,474L. The balance of 1,080,316L. is equal to a return of 3L. 16s. 0d.* per cent. on the capital invested. The gauge throughout is 3ft. 6in.

Of telegraphs there are now 10,901 miles of land lines and 34,788 miles of wire, constructed at a cost of about 1½ million pounds. There are five submarine cables connecting the two islands of New Zealand, two, Wakapuaka-La Perouse, connecting the Dominion with Australia.

The Pacific cable, which was opened for traffic to Australia and Fiji in April, 1902, was completed to Bamfield, Vancouver Island, on the 31st October following, and opened for international traffic on the 8th December.

The Pacific cable traffic is transmitted across the Atlantic by the Anglo-American and Commercial Telegraph companies. Following the opening of the Pacific cable a much faster cable service between the Dominion and America and Europe has resulted, and the time has also improved on the Eastern Extension Company's lines. Messages via the Pacific from London frequently reach the Dominion within thirty minutes, and the average time of transmission may be put down at about ninety minutes, which should be regarded as a really good service.

* The rate of interest earned has been computed on cost proportionately to the time during which the lines taken over by the Working Railway's Department within the financial year were earning revenue. Thus a considerable length of the North Island Main Trunk and the whole of the Wellington-Manawatu lines earned revenue for the Department during only a portion of the year 1908-9, while the total cost of construction or purchase is included under that head.

The Pacific traffic is steadily growing, and since the completion of the cable the Dominion's telegraph business by both routes has increased by about 50 per cent.

On the opening of the Pacific cable for through traffic the ordinary rate to Great Britain was reduced from 3s. 4d. to 3s. a word, a previous reduction from 5s. 2d. to 3s. 4d. having been made by the Eastern Company as from the 1st June, 1902; Government messages from 2s. 4d. to 1s. 6¾d., and Press from 1s. 2d. to 1s. a word. The following reduced rates were also brought into operation: to Vancouver and San Francisco, 2s. 4d. per word; to New York, 2s. 8d. per word; a reduction of 2s. 6d. and 1s. 8d. per word on the rates formerly charged via Eastern. Corresponding reductions came into force for America generally.

The average number of messages transmitted to and from New Zealand prior to the opening of the Pacific cable was about 425 per day. The present average is over 650 a day by both routes.

To the advent of the Pacific cable is to be credited the general reduction of rates and the improvement in the cable services generally. The reduced rates based on the present traffic, it is estimated, mean a saving of over 55,000L. a year to business firms and other users of the cables between New Zealand and other parts of the world.

In the year ending 31st March, 1910, excluding the value of Government messages, the revenue was 394,510L. (including telephone exchange and other telegraph receipts); number of messages 7,846,890 (of which number 7,757,128 were private or press messages). From the 1st November, 1906, the inland rate on ordinary telegrams was reduced from ¼d. for the first twelve words and ½d. each additional word to ½d. each word, with a minimum charge of 6d. The principal towns have telephone exchanges. In March, 1910, there were 30 exchanges and 123 sub-exchanges in operation.

Tramways have been established in all the principal towns in New Zealand, and Dunedin has, in addition, two cable lines leading to high-lying suburbs, and Wellington an incline line. The ordinary tramways are in some few cases worked by steam motors, but electric power is more generally employed. The cable tramways are practically on the same system as those in San Francisco.

Auckland, Dunedin, Christchurch, Wellington, and Wanganui have electric tramway systems on the overhead principle.

The Government has expended about 787,259L. on the construction of reservoirs, water-races, and sludge-channels on the gold-fields.

All the cities and principal towns are supplied with water at the cost of the corporations; Auckland, Napier, Lyttelton, and Invercargill have pumping schemes, but the others are supplied by gravitation.

All the principal towns in the Dominion have gasworks, some of them belonging to private companies, but the majority to the corporations. The native coal from Greymouth is stated to be one of the best in the world for making gas. In Wellington the streets are illuminated by the electric light, as also are the parliamentary buildings and many private houses and business establishments.

Dunedin is lighted by electricity generated by water power from the Waipori stream, under
the control of the City Corporation, which also supplies electrical energy from the same sources for industrial and manufacturing purposes.

Other towns with electrical installations for street and private lighting are Auckland, Rotorua, New Plymouth, Stratford, Inglewood, Hawera, Patea, Reefton, Ross, Christchurch, Timaru, Gore, Mataura, Te Aroha, Waitara, Eketahuna, Ashburton and Bluff.

The coasts of the Dominion are well marked with lighthouses and beacons, and all the ports are provided with wharves and jetties in proportion to the trade. Important works to afford shelter and increase the depth of water have been executed or are in course of construction at Dunedin, Oamaru, Timaru, Lyttelton, Greymouth, Westport, New Plymouth, and Napier. There are graving docks at Port Chalmers, Lyttelton, and Auckland. At Wellington there is a patent slip capable of taking up a two thousand ton ship, and a large dry dock is now under construction.

The Public Works of the Dominion, including both railways and roads, but not buildings, are now principally carried out on what is known as the co-operative system,—that is, the Government provides all materials and lets the work of construction to parties of artisans and labourers at rates fixed by the officers of the Government, and calculated so that an average workman will be able to earn the current rate of wages ruling in his trade in the district where the work is situated. The ruling rates of wages are from 9s. to 12s. per day for artisans, and from 8s. to 10s. for labourers. Eight hours constitutes a working day.

Mail Communication.

There is regular mail communication with England and Europe by direct steamers and via Vancouver, Brindisi, Naples, and San Francisco, and with all Australian ports, the South Sea Islands, United States, Canada, Uruguay, and Brazil.

Postage Rates.

The postage on letters inland is 1d. per 4 ounces, or fraction thereof, and ½d. for each succeeding 2 ounces or fraction thereof, and to such places as accept matter at the reduced rate, 1d. for each ounce or fraction thereof. The reduction (to 1d. per ounce) applies in any case to British possessions, and to a number of foreign countries which have agreed to deliver letters from New Zealand prepaid at 1d. without surcharge, although not in every case applying the rate reciprocally. The letter postage to other places beyond New Zealand is 2½d. for the first ounce, and 1¼d. for each succeeding ounce, or fraction thereof. The minimum rate for newspapers printed and published in New Zealand, for the United Kingdom, is 1d. for each newspaper, irrespective of weight, but subject to the following conditions as to despatch:—if under 8 ounces, prepaid 1d., sent by first available route; if over 8 ounces, prepaid 1d., sent by direct steamers only. The rate for certain other British possessions is 1d. for each newspaper. The rate for newspapers not printed and published in New Zealand, addressed to the United Kingdom, is for each newspaper:—1d. for the first 4 ounces, and ½d. for each additional 2 ounces or fraction thereof. The inland rate for newspapers remains at ½d. each.
